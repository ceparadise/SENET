Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I studying computer science absolutely flummoxed
The definition I find discrete data countable continuous uncountable
Examples given stating integer discrete real number continuous
Rationals state controversial
I understand topic fall within category discrete mathematics I get
Especially set theory universal set real number
How I continuous realm value consider structure discrete
Considering integer real belong unlimited realm possibility I fail see either one considered countable infinite
How would define discrete mathematics would someone recognize discrete continuous mathematics faced
My knowledge mathematics discrete limited please explain would year old
The difference countable uncountable set well formalized never doubt
These two different size infinity
You read page information countable uncountable But I think one intuition really helpful also linking computer science fact countable set set whose element finitely describable
For instance integer written piece paper set integer countable
This make integer manageable computer since completely describe integer finite way always pas computer finite sequence
This also real countable might need write decimal infinite sequence
This make continuous mathematics automatic treatment computer
Of course schematic detailed intuition important
It possible formally prove every element E contains finite amount information E countable
Following intuition rational countable rational r given two integer b
This prevent rational important tool analysis real approached rational arbitrarily close say Q dense R
But computer algorithm dealing arbitrary number actually deal rational number
As classification math discrete continuous frontier really everything interacts everything else almost impossible give sound definition
A big part subjective
At best flavour field mostly discrete like graph theory continuous analysis case might need also consider side order get good understanding like using probability theory graph theory
Admittedly distinction always clear cut
Various field mathematics tend overlap much difficult say algebra topology whatever
The subconscious distinction largely develops technique one us feel
For instance said analysis art taking limit
The flavor often simple finite case
Yes
Apply limit theorem
Can take limit limit
No
Okay need control error term
Probability PDE also fall category thing obvious reason lot derivative measure theory space
Ironically thing modern continuous Ã priori
Discrete math hand test different way
Combinatorics great example often need little background understand question underlying technique sophisticated require experience
You might consider finite group theory discrete math could reasonable considering permutation group much analysis done locally compact Abelian Hausdorff group
Sieve argument kind used proof twin prime conjecture also combinatorial
You worry much distinction
As Feynman pointed knowing name something bring closer understanding
Dabble learn eventually able say feel like typical argument discrete math
I mean know difference fruit vegetable
There grey area banana berry tomato fruit someone hand something juicy sweet crisp delicious say fruit
even though one told
According dictionary discrete mean constituting separate entity part I think usage meant talk discrete mathematics
The best way know discrete mathematics probably study text paper discrete mathematics
Some people like discrete mathematics continuous mathematics others mindset suited towards continuous mathematics people different taste interest
On hand different area mathematics intimately related boundary discipline created artificially
You might want read article available online Laszlo Lovasz titled Discrete continuous two side
To rather indiscrete different area science mathematics let different aspect everyday life use word contradictory way
Look word dictionary chance see dozen meaning
Furthermore anytime told X mean Y suspend belief Almost certainly statement false
Different word exist different meaning nuance
They may coincide referent truth value time still different meaning
Different word get different formal definition different part science mathematics
For example word like significance confidence different meaning different paper machine learning data mining
Different theory set mean word set different meaning theory
The functional idea continuity concern mapping domain range constraint
continuous range two value range contains value range
continuous function two value domain closer delta mapping intervening value continuous domain lie range
Considering sqr rational rational work fine rational two rational etc
Of course sqrt rational rational problem irrational root second problem imaginary root negative part domain complex range needed
So problem rational countable continuous
Discrete mean individual separate distinguishable implying discontinuous continuous integer discrete sense even though countable sense use count
In fact formal definition countable anything count integer sense defining bijective function integer set
In computer science machine learning data mining etc
What important treat attribute
A data mining text may actually distinguish categorical discrete enumerated nominal treat alike thing without idea thing
But enumeration also implies ordering value need able counted enumerated integer numbered
However purpose may taxonomy defined showing relationship discrete item like card suit colour face value number card v card etc
Similarly purpose ordering needed range integer suit card game fuzzy term like small medium large etc
From computer science perspective difference real rational ca represent arbitrary real tend use decimal representation sometimes rational representation surd representation really representation including pi e phi constant want try represent
Thus idea count map nicely idea discrete one sense practice rational real wo regarded discrete discrete would normally mean whole number integer
This reflects another idea discrete meaning whole entire denying possibility subdividing
This come back functional idea continuity thing equivalently able subdivide interval concept fraction rational
Of course real complex number much later invention lie outside intuitive everyday framework ca directly represented full range computer science
In fact stated definition like useful assumption axiom computer science
To address two question raised Discrete set consist entirely
set one find small enough neighborhood one point set contained intuition point spread apart minimum distance point
Discrete mathematics done using method typically using integer
combinatorics elementary number theory finite subset rational
discrete probability theory
No rational discrete set even though countably infinite
This rational isolated point always find nearby rational number close like
This called Archimedean property rational see asking tiny fraction say I find smaller one
Sure
So neighborhood put around rational point could find another rational within
However collection rational number discrete since finitely many rational minimum distance two rational set one find interval smaller guarantee one rational given time
This mean finite set rational isolated set therefore discrete
Note reason discrete probability use rational still considered discrete set event considered finite ever calling upon finite number rational describe

Data Representation GCSE Computer Science Revision
So far talking data something swimming poked logical sequence told form orderly pattern generally shape
Without identifying different characteristic data like looking sea insect heaving mass movement rather identifying insect specie purpose

Firstly let separate data two group analogue digital Analogue data readable real time read information continuous process
We live life analogue receive continual stream data via sens
Digital data contrast made separate element basic form two number building block binary language
Now paddling gene pool digital data let look amoeba digital life know bit
A bit either
Next nibble four bit
You could say bit nibble
Or
Anyway byte
A byte eight bit also mean two nibble
So byte two nibble nibble four bit bit
Moving towards deeper end digital gene pool find bigger beast like Kilobytes byte Megabytes Kilobytes powerful beast far Yottabyte
Here three digital data group first American Standard Code Information Exchange ASCII This us binary code key refer different character symbol kind way spy might set code passing secret information
You know sound file course
A music sound file sequence binary code represents pattern sound wave better sound quality bigger file greater number plotted point along digital sound wave take space
Lastly video
Again high quality video file size going ginormous far big even five minute video edited basic computer
How get round
By compressing frame film Moving Pictures Expert Group file MPEG

Computers machine stuff information
They let view listen create edit information document image video sound spreadsheet database
They let play game simulated world really exist except information inside computer memory displayed screen
They let compute calculate numerical information let send receive information network
Fundamental computer represent information way inside computer memory well storing disk sending network
To make computer easier build keep reliable everything represented using two value
You may seen two value represented computer represented anything two state
For example memory low high voltage used store
On magnetic disk stored magnetism whether tiny spot disk magnetised north south
The idea stored transmitted digital world stored using two value might seem somewhat fantastic exercise give little experience using black white card represent number
In following interactive click last card right reveal one dot
Now click previous card two dot
Before clicking next one many dot predict
Carry clicking card moving left trying guess many dot
Use interactive online The challenge find way exactly dot showing answer spoiler
Now try making number dot
Is number ca represented
To test try counting
You may noticed card show twice many dot one right
This important pattern data representation computer
The number requires card white black white white black black white black white white white white white black white white black black black white
You found number represented card
Each number could communicated using two word black white
For example dot white black white white black
Or could decode black black white white white number
This basis data representation anything two different state represent anything digital device
When write stored computer paper normally use one state state
For example piece computer memory could following voltage We could allocate write sequence While notation used extensively may often hear data referred important remember computer store way
They using physical mechanism high low voltage north south polarity light dark material
The use two digit common best known computer jargon used
Since two digit system called binary
The short word binary digit made taking first two letter last letter digit two value
Every file save every picture make every download every digital recording every web page whole lot bit
These binary digit make digital technology
And nature digit unlock powerful world storing sharing wealth information entertainment
Computer scientist spend lot time reading bit knowing stored really important affect amount space data use amount time take send data friend data take space take longer send
quality stored
You may come across thing like colour encryption address ASCII
Understanding bit enables work much space required get colour secret code unique ID every device world text us character usual English alphabet
This chapter different method computer use code different kind information pattern bit affect cost quality computer even something feasible
To begin look Braille
Braille actually way computer represent data great introduction topic
When working material section good way draw braille paper without actually make raised dot draw rectangle small circle colour circle raised colour one raised
More year ago French boy invented system representing text using combination flat raised dot paper could read touch
The system became popular people visual impairment provided relatively fast reliable way read text without seeing
Louis Braille system early example binary representation data two symbol raised flat yet combination used represent reference book work literature
Each character braille represented cell dot
Each dot either raised raised
Different number letter made using different pattern raised raised dot
Let work many different pattern made using dot Braille character
If braille used dot would pattern
And dot would pattern You may noticed twice many pattern dot dot
It turn every time add extra dot give twice many pattern dot pattern dot pattern dot pattern
Can come explanation doubling number pattern occurs
The reason number pattern double extra dot say dot pattern dot use pattern dot flat raised
This give pattern
And one dot bring dot
This process repeated infinitely
So Braille dot make pattern
That enough letter alphabet symbol digit punctuation
The reason looking Braille chapter representation using bit
That contains different value raised raised contains sequence represent different pattern
The letter example could written mean raised dot mean raised dot assuming reading left right
This sometimes use show computer representing data
Braille also illustrates binary representation popular
It would possible three kind dot flat half raised raised
A skilled braille reader could distinguish three value per dot would need dot represent pattern
The trouble would need accurate device create dot people would need accurate sensing
If page squashed even slightly could leave information unreadable
Digital device almost always use two value binary similar reason computer disk memory made cheaper smaller need able distinguish two extreme value high low voltage rather distinction subtle difference voltage
Using ten digit like every day decimal counting system would obviously challenging
Why digital system hung using two digit
After could thing digit system
As happens people tried build computer hard
Recording digit involves accurate equipment reading voltage level magnetisation reflection lot easier check mainly one way
There discussion use binary Watch video online In section look computer represent number
To begin revise number system use every day work look binary
After look charactertistics number computer must deal negative number number decimal point
The number system human normally use base also known decimal
It worth revising quickly binary number use idea decimal number fewer digit
In decimal value digit number depends number
For example represents whereas represents
Each place value number worth time place value right
one ten hundred thousand ten thousand hundred thousand million
Also different place value
If able use one digit represent number largest number would
After need second digit go left giving next ten number
It digit one worth time much one right
You may encountered different way expressing number using expanded form
For example want write number expanded form might written A sophisticated way writing If learnt exponent could write Remember number power
x
The key idea notice All probably sound really obvious worth thinking consciously binary number property
As discussed earlier computer store information using bit possible state
This mean represent base number using digit way write number decimal
Instead must represent number using digit
Binary work similar way Decimal even though might initially seem way
Because digit mean digit time value one immediately right
The base decimal system sometimes called denary consistent name binary base system
The word denary also refers Roman denarius coin worth ten ass copper bronze coin
The term denary seems used mainly UK US Australia NZ term decimal common
The interactive illustrates binary number system represents number
Have play around see pattern see
Use interactive online Find representation using interactive
What largest number make interactive
What smallest
Is integer value biggest smallest make
Are number one representation

You probably noticed interactive set leftmost bit significant bit add total next add rest add respectively
When set bit add anything total
So idea make number adding together number included
Choose number le perhaps house number age friend age day month born set binary digit zero start digit trying zero one
See find method converting number without much trial error
Try different number find quick way
Figure binary representation using interactive
What
Check answer using interactive verify correct
Can figure systematic approach counting binary

start number increment way highest number made bit
Try counting see detect pattern
Hint Think add number base
work etc
Can apply idea binary
Using new knowledge binary number system figure way count higher using finger
What highest number represent using finger
What included toe well finger toe count
A binary number incremented starting right flipping consecutive bit come first bit half time
Counting finger binary mean count finger finger
There number video YouTube people counting binary finger
One twist wear white glove number finger respectively make easy work value certain finger raised
The interactive used exactly bit
In practice use many bit need like decimal
For example bit place value would largest value binary decimal
Representing bit would give
Write representation following
If possible representation put Impossible
The answer space added make answer easier read required An important concept binary number range value represented using given number bit
When bit binary number start get useful represent value enough store someone age day month
Groups bit useful name
Computer memory disk space usually divided byte bigger value stored using one byte
For example two byte bit enough store number
Four byte bit store number
You check number working place value bit
Every bit added double range number
In practice computer store number either bit
This full number byte byte bit make easier computer know number start stop
Candles birthday cake use base numbering system place worth one right
For example number
This cause problem get older ever seen cake candle aware serious fire hazard
Luckily possible use binary notation birthday candle candle either lit lit
For example binary notation need candle two lit
There
It lot smarter use binary notation candle birthday get older need many candle
Most time binary number stored electronically need worry making sense
But sometimes useful able write share number unique identifier assigned digital device MAC address colour specified HTML page
Writing long binary number tedious example suppose need copy number
A widely used shortcut break number group case write digit group represents giving
There one small problem group bit go digit go
The solution simple introduce symbol digit letter A So example binary number written concisely
The B represents binary decimal number E represents binary decimal
Because digit representation base known hexadecimal hex short
Converting binary hexadecimal simple hexadecimal common way writing large binary number
Here full table number hexadecimal digit equivalent For example largest binary number
This written FF hexadecimal
Both representation mean conventional decimal system check converting binary number decimal
Which notation use depend situation binary number represent actually stored confusing read write hexadecimal number good shorthand binary decimal number used trying understand meaning number normal math
All three widely used computer science
It important remember though computer represent number using binary
They represent number directly decimal hexadecimal
A common place number stored computer spreadsheet database
These entered either spreadsheet program database program program somebody else wrote additional hardware sensor collecting data temperature air pressure ground shaking
Some thing might think number telephone number actually stored number contain important character like dash space well leading would lost stored number number would come quite right
These stored discussed next section
On hand thing look like number January often stored using value converted format meaningful reader try typing two date Excel subtract one result useful number
In underlying representation number used
Program code used translate underlying representation meaningful date user interface
The difference two date Excel number day date many system stored amount time elapsed since fixed date January
You test typing date like January chance wo formatted normal date
Likewise date sufficiently future may behave strangely due limited number bit available store date
Numbers used store thing diverse date student mark price statistic scientific reading size dimension graphic
The following issue need considered storing number computer In practice need allocate fixed number bit number know big number
This often bit bit although set bit even bit needed
This computer way knowing number start end otherwise
Any system store number need make compromise number bit allocated store number range value stored
In system like Java C programming language database possible specify accurately number stored others fixed advance spreadsheet
Some able work arbitrarily large number increasing space used store necessary
integer Python programming language
However likely still working multiple bit
bit bit bit bit etc
Once number big fit bit computer would reallocate bit
In programming language check number get big overflow
For example number using two complement largest number add one without checking change happens number
This cause serious problem checked behind variant problem called involving number overflowing date Tuesday January
On tiny computer embedded inside car washing machine tiny sensor barely larger grain sand might need specify precisely big number need
While computer prefer work chunk bit could write program example earthquake sensor know first bit lattitude next bit longitude next bit depth last bit amount force
Even standard computer important think carefully number bit need
For example field database could either perhaps representing four base occur DNA sequence used bit number every one add database grows
If item database wasted bit one bit needed represent number example total bit around MB
If lot database really add human DNA billion base pair incredibly wasteful use bit one
And application Google Maps storing astronomical amount data wasting space option
It really useful know roughly many bit need represent certain value
Have think following scenario choose best number bit option given
You want ensure largest possible number fit within number bit also want ensure wasting space
The binary number representation looked far allows u represent positive number
In practice want able represent negative number well balance account go negative amount temperature fall zero
In normal representation base number represent negative number putting minus sign front number
But binary simple
We look two possible approach Adding simple sign bit much like decimal useful system called Two Complement
On computer minus sign number work well use text based one representing number ca arithmetic character allocating one extra bit called bit represent minus sign
Just like decimal number put negative indicator left number sign bit set mean number positive sign bit set number negative minus sign front
For example wanted represent number using bit along additional bit sign bit give total bit would represent
The first bit meaning number positive remaining bit give meaning number
If wanted make would
The first bit meaning number negative remaining bit represent meaning number
Using bit described one sign actual number would binary representation
The space necessary added make reading binary number easier Going way easy
If binary number know negative first digit
The number part next bit
This mean number
What would decimal value following assuming first bit sign bit
But That convert
And
Since strange two different representation number
This one reason use simple sign bit practice
Instead computer usually use sophisticated representation negative binary number called
There alternative representation called avoids two representation importantly make easier arithmetic negative number
Representing positive number method already learnt
Using leftmost bit zero bit usual binary representation number example would would
This thing get interesting
In order convert negative number two complement representation use following process
For example assume want convert Two Complement representation
We would use process follows
Therefore Two Complement representation
The rule adding one binary number pretty simple let figure
First binary number end
would number change replace last
Now end much would increase change
What ending

The method adding simple easy build computer hardware quickly
What would two complement representation following number
Follow process given section remember need anything special positive number
In order reverse process need know whether number looking positive negative
For positive number simply convert binary number back decimal
But negative number first need convert back normal binary number
So know number positive negative
It turn reason understand later section Two Complement number negative always start positive number always start
Have look back previous example double check
So number start use following process convert number back negative decimal number
So needed convert back decimal would following
Convert following Two Complement number decimal
While might initially seem bit allocated sign bit bit behaves like one
With bit still make possible pattern
If attempted use bit represent positive number negative number would quickly realise number mapped onto pattern bit
Obviously make impossible know number actually represented
In practice number within following range represented
many number represent allow positive number sign needed many number represent require positive negative number
You work range value stored using unsigned number
decimal signed two complement range lowest number decimal highest number decimal
This might seem bit weird work really well normal binary addition used use representation even adding negative number
Before adding negative binary number look adding positive number
It basically addition method used decimal number except rule way simpler two different digit might add
You probably learnt column addition
For example following column addition would used
When go add result higher put one column carry column
Binary addition work exactly way
If wanted add two positive binary number would follow similar process column addition
You need know
The first three might expect
Adding cause carry digit since binary translates carry column addition
The last one add binary express carry
For two example number addition work like Remember digit
So need carry next column total get column decimal
With negative number using sign bit like work
If wanted add would expect get answer
Which
One way could solve problem use column subtraction instead
But would require giving computer hardware circuit could
Luckily unnecessary addition negative number work automatically using Two Complement
For addition start converting number Two Complement form
Because positive number need changed
But negative number sign bit removed use Two Complement need invert digit add giving
Adding two number work like Any extra bit left beyond using case bit truncated
This leaf like expecting
We also use subtraction
If subtracting positive number positive number would need convert number subtracting negative number
Then add two number
This decimal number example
This property Two Complement useful
It mean positive number negative number handled computer circuit addition subtraction treated operation
The idea using complementary number change subtraction addition seen decimal
The complement decimal digit digit add example complement complement
The word complement come root complete completes nice round number
Subtracting adding complement ignoring extra digit left
The complement add giving
For larger number subtracting two number complement number add next power

Check adding produce almost result subtracting
Working complement binary way easier two digit work working decimal may help understand going
We looked two different way representing negative number computer
In practice simple sign bit rarely used two different representation zero requiring different computer circuit handle negative positive number addition subtraction
Two Complement widely used one representation zero allows positive number negative number treated way addition subtraction treated one operation
There system One Complement Two Complement far widely used practice
There several different way computer use bit store text
In section look common one look pro con representation
We saw earlier unique pattern made using dot Braille
A dot corresponds bit dot bit different possible value
Count many different character letter letter number symbol could type text editor using keyboard
Don forget count symbol share number key symbol side punctuation
The collective name letter letter number symbol
D h character
Importantly space also character
If counted correctly find character might found around
Because bit represent character need bit turn need least bit represent character give possible pattern
This exactly representation text
In previous section explained happens number dot increased remember dot Braille effectively bit
Can explain knew bit enough represent character bit must enough represent character
Each pattern ASCII usually stored bit one wasted bit rather bit
However bit pattern meaning still possible pattern
Where possible prefer deal full byte bit computer ASCII extra wasted bit
Here table show pattern bit ASCII us character
For example letter c table pattern front extra padding make bit
The letter pattern
You could write word using code give someone else able decode exactly
Computers represent piece text sequence pattern much like Braille
For example word computer would
This c
Have look ASCII table check right
The name ASCII stand American Standard Code Information Interchange particular way assigning bit pattern character keyboard
The ASCII system even includes character ringing bell useful getting attention old telegraph system deleting previous character kind early undo end transmission let receiver know message finished
These day character rarely used code still exist missing pattern table
Nowadays ASCII supplanted code called happens ASCII extra bit open huge range character bit
Have go following ASCII exercise Be sure go checking answer
These answer
Note text treated character ASCII may confusing text different number
You may encountered distinction spreadsheet
cell start inverted comma Excel treated text rather number
One place come phone number type spreadsheet number come text displayed
In fact phone number really number leading zero important contain character example extn

ASCII first used commercially despite big change computer since still basis English text stored computer
ASCII assigned different pattern bit character along control character delete backspace
English text easily represented using ASCII language Chinese thousand different character
Unsurprisingly pattern nearly enough represent language
Because ASCII useful practice longer used widely
In next section look Unicode representation
These solve problem unable represent character
There several code popular ASCII including
A widely used variant Baudot code Murray code named New Zealand born inventor
One Murray significant improvement introduce idea control character carriage return new line
The control key still exists modern keyboard
In practice need able represent English character
To solve problem use standard called
Unicode around different character many different language current historic
Each character unique number assigned making easy identify
Unicode representation character set
In order represent Unicode character bit Unicode used
The Unicode encoding scheme tell u number corresponds Unicode character represented pattern bit
The following interactive allow explore Unicode character set
Enter number box left see Unicode character corresponds enter character right see Unicode number could paste one foreign language web page see happens character
Use interactive online The widely used Unicode encoding scheme called may seen name email header describing text file
Some Unicode encoding scheme
mean character represented using number bit
mean character represented fewer bit others
It better ensure commonly used character represented fewer bit uncommonly used character
Of course might commonly used character English necessarily commonly used character Japanese
You may wondering need many encoding scheme Unicode
It turn better English language text better Asian language text
The remainder text representation section look Unicode encoding scheme understand use better others certain situation
Unicode encoding scheme
The representation character simply number converted bit binary number
Leading zero used enough bit like represent digit decimal number
bit nice round number computer often referred word bit confusing since use character represent English word
For example character would The character would And character would The following interactive allow convert Unicode character representation
The Unicode character number also displayed
The bit simply binary number form character number
Use interactive online ASCII actually took approach
Each ASCII character number representation character number converted bit binary number
ASCII also fixed length encoding scheme every character ASCII represented using bit
In practice rarely used see pretty wasteful space
variable length encoding scheme widely used
We look next
What largest number represented bit
In decimal binary
The largest number Unicode character assigned actually largest possible bit number
What number decimal
Most number made using bit Unicode character attached lot wasted space
There good reason shorter number could represent character minimum number bit would need given currently around Unicode character
The largest number represented using bit around billion
You might seen number largest unsigned integer bit computer easily represent programming language The decimal number largest character
You represent current character bit
The largest number represent bit enough
If go bit give larger
Therefore need bit
encoding scheme Unicode
Characters lower Unicode number require fewer bit representation higher Unicode number
representation contain either bit
Remembering bit byte
For example character would The character would And character would The following interactive allow convert Unicode character representation
The Unicode character number also displayed
Use interactive online So actually work
Use following process interactive convert character
Lookup Unicode number character
Convert Unicode number binary number using bit necessary
Look back section binary number remember convert number binary
Count many bit binary number choose correct pattern use based many bit
Step explain use pattern
Replace x pattern bit binary number converted
If x bit replace extra x
For example wanted find representation cat Chinese step would take would follows
Therefore representation using
Just like encoding scheme Unicode
Because far complex wo explain work
However following interactive allow represent text
Try putting text English text Japanese
Compare representation get
Use interactive online We looked ASCII
The following table summarises said far representation
In order compare evaluate need decide mean representation good
Two useful criterion We know represent character ASCII represent English
Therefore ASCII fails first criterion
But second criterion simple
The following interactive allow find length piece text using
Find sample English text Asian text forum translation site good place look see long various sample encoded three representation
Copy paste type text box
Enter text length calculation Encoding length Use interactive online As general rule better English text better Asian text
always requires bit character unpopular practice

Represent word water bit using system
Check panel think
In school art class may mixed different colour paint dye together order make new colour
In painting common use red yellow blue three primary colour mixed produce lot colour
Mixing red blue give purple red yellow give orange
By mixing red yellow blue make many new colour
For printing printer commonly use three slightly different primary colour cyan magenta yellow CMY
All colour printed document made mixing primary colour
Both kind mixing called subtractive mixing start white canvas paper subtract colour
The interactive allows experiment CMY incase familiar like mixing colour
Use interactive online Computer screen related device also rely mixing three colour except need different set primary colour starting black screen adding colour
For additive colour computer colour red green blue RGB used
Each pixel screen typically made three tiny light one red one green one blue
By increasing decreasing amount light coming three different colour made
The following interactive allows play around RGB
Use interactive online See colour make interactive
Can make black white shade grey yellow orange purple
Having slider extreme produce black white value grey
black white
Yellow might expect made red green blue
There good reason mix three primary colour specify colour pixel
The human eye million light sensor one detect colour called cone
There three different kind cone detect red blue green light respectively
Colours perceived amount red blue green light
Computer screen pixel take advantage releasing amount red blue green light perceived desired colour eye
So see purple really red blue cone eye stimulated brain convert perceived colour
Scientists still working exactly perceive colour representation used computer seem good enough give impression looking real image
For information RGB display see information eye sensing three colour see Wikipedia
Because colour simply made amount primary colour red green blue three number used specify much primary colour needed make overall colour
The word short picture element
On computer screen printer image almost always displayed using grid pixel one set required colour
A pixel typically fraction millimeter across image made million pixel one megapixel million pixel ca usually see individual pixel
Photographs commonly several megapixels
It unusual computer screen million computer need represent colour one pixel
A commonly used scheme use number range
Those number tell computer fully turn primary colour light individual pixel
If red set mean red light completely
If red light set would mean light fully
With possible value three primary colour forget count
give x x possible colour human eye detect
Think back binary number section
What special number maximum colour value
We cover answer later section still sure
The following interactive allows zoom image see pixel used represent
Each pixel solid colour square computer need store colour pixel
If zoom far enough interactive show value pixel
You pick pixel put value slider come colour pixel
Use interactive online Another exercise see relationship bit pattern colour image
The next thing need look bit used represent colour high quality image
Firstly many bit need
Secondly decide value bit
This section work problem
With different possible value amount primary colour mean bit would needed represent number
The smallest number represented using bit
And largest number represented using bit
Because three primary colour need bit represent different possible value need represent colour
So many colour total bit
We know possible value colour take easiest way calculating This
Because bit required representation called
bit colour sometimes referred setting True Color accurate human eye see
On Apple system called Millions colour
A logical way use binary number represent amount red green blue pixel
In order convert amount primary colour needed bit binary number put binary number side side give bit
Because consistency important order computer make sense bit pattern normally adopt convention binary number red put first followed green finally blue
The reason put red first convention system assume used
If everybody agreed green first would green first
For example suppose colour red green blue would like represent bit
If put value interactive get colour
Start converting three number binary using bit
You get Putting value together give bit representation colour
There three number pattern bit rather actually three binary number computer concept space bit pattern anyway everything must
You could write space make easier read represent idea likely stored byte inside computer memory sequence high low voltage even writing arbitrary notation
Also leading trailing part kept without would representing shorter number
If different possible value primary colour final representation bit long
Black white image usually two colour typically shade grey represented bit
Remember shade grey made equal amount primary colour example red green blue
So monochromatic image simply use representation single binary number tell u value primary colour set
The computer ever convert number decimal work binary directly process take bit make right pixel appear typically done graphic card printer
We started decimal easier human understand
The main point knowing representation understand made accuracy colour ideally beyond human perception amount storage bit needed little possible
If already read section otherwise section might make sense
When writing HTML code often need specify colour text background
One way specify colour name example red blue purple gold
For purpose okay
However use name limit number colour represent shade might exactly one wanted
A better way specify bit colour directly
Because binary digit hard read colour HTML use quick way write bit example
The hash sign mean interpreted hexadecimal representation since hexadecimal digit corresponds bit digit represent bit colour information
This hex triplet format used HTML page specify colour thing like background page text colour link
It also used CSS SVG application
In bit colour example earlier bit pattern
This broken group bit
And group bit need represented digit
Which give
Understanding hexadecimal colour code derived also allows change slightly without refer back colour table colour exactly one want
Remember bit color code first bit specify amount red first digit hexadecimal code next bit specify amount green next digit hexadecimal code last bit specify amount blue last digit hexadecimal code
To increase amount one colour change appropriate hexadecimal letter
For example zero red green blue setting higher value middle two digit add green colour
You use HTML page experiment hexadecimal colour
Just enter colour space Use interactive online What use fewer bit represent colour
How much space saved compared impact image
The following interactive get try match specific colour using bit bit
It possible get perfect match using bit colour
But bit
Use interactive online The system used bit specify amount red possible value bit specify amount green possible value bit specify amount blue possible value
This give total bit hence name used make different bit pattern thus represent different colour
You may wondering blue represented fewer bit red green
This human eye least sensitive blue therefore least important colour representation
The representation us bit rather bit easiest computer work full byte
Using scheme represent pixel image take one third number bit required colour good showing smooth change colour subtle shade possible color pixel
This one big tradeoff data representation allocate le space fewer bit want higher quality
The number bit used represent colour pixel particular image sometimes referred colour depth bit depth
For example image display colour depth choice colour pixel
There
Drastically reducing bit depth image make look strange sometimes used special effect called posterisation ie
making look like poster printed colour
There subtle boundary low quality data representation colour compression method
In principle reducing image colour way compress poor approach proper compression method like JPEG much better job
The following interactive show happens image use smaller range colour including right zero bit
You choose image using menu upload one
In case change quality noticeable
In
In would actually care colour image
In situation colour actually necessary
fine two colour
Use interactive online Although provide simple interactive reducing number bit image could also use software like Gimp Photoshop save file different colour depth
You probably noticed colour look particularly bad face used seeing subtle skin tone
Even colour noticably worse face
In case image almost good image unless look really carefully
They also use space would colour
For image need downloaded device internet expensive worth thinking carefully
Have experiement following interactive see impact different number bit colour
Do think bit colour right bit blue green red got bit
Use interactive online One interesting thing think whether want bit colour
It turn human eye differentiate around million colour million provided bit colour already beyond eye distinguish
However image processed software enhances contrast may turn colour sufficient
Choosing representation simple
An image represented using bit colour would bit per pixel
In x pixel image reasonable size photo would contain pixel thus would use bit
This work around megabyte
If use colour instead use third memory would save nearly megabyte storage
Or image downloaded megabyte bandwidth saved
bit colour used much anymore although still helpful situation accessing computer desktop remotely slow internet connection image desktop instead sent using bit colour instead bit colour
Even though may cause desktop appear bit strange stop getting whatever needed get done done
Seeing desktop bit colour would helpful could get work done
In country mobile internet data expensive
Every megabyte saved cost saving
There also situation colour matter example diagram black white printed image
If space really issue crude method reducing range colour usually used instead compression method JPEG GIF PNG used
These make much clever compromise reduce space image take without making look bad including choosing better palette colour use rather using simple representation discussed
However compression method require lot processing image need decoded representation discussed chapter displayed
The idea present chapter commonly come designing system graphic interface working image RAW photograph typically goal choose best representation possible without wasting much space
Have look Compression Chapter find
Before reading section understanding low level language see section chapter
In similar fashion representing text number using binary represent entire actual program using binary
Since program sequence instruction need decide many bit used represent single instruction going interpret bit
Machine code instruction typically combination two piece operation operand
In machine code program li add considered operation load integer add two integer respectively
register operand represent place store value inside machine
literal operand allow instruction represent exact integer value
If using operating system might encode instruction instruction broken piece follows Our operation always determined bit first instruction
In example machine code mean li mean add
For li operation bit interpreted storage place allowing represent
Similarly bit add instruction represent
Can figure bit instruction represent
Using bit represent program instruction data form text number image allows entire computer program represented binary format
This allows program stored disk memory transferred internet easily data
The kind image representation covered basic one used digital system main point chapter understand digital representation work compromise needed number bit storage used quality
The colour representation discussed often referred raw bitmap bmp representation
For large image real system use compression method JPEG GIF PNG reduce space needed store image point image captured displayed inevitably represented using raw bit described chapter basic choice capturing displaying image affect quality cost device
Compression regarded form encoding covered later chapter
The representation number whole area study
The choice representation affect quickly arithmetic done number accurate result much memory disk space used storing data
Even integer issue like order large number broken across multiple byte
Floating point number generally follow common standard IEEE standard common one make easy design compatible hardware process
Spreadsheets usually store number using floating point format limit precision calculation typically bit used number
There many experiment done calculating adding large number small one demonstrate limitation floating point representation

Computers often represent color RGB set number called triple red green blue component integer
For example color full red green small amount blue
Write algorithm take input RGB component color return message indicating largest component component
For example input color algorithm output
And input color algorithm output
One amazing aspect computer store many different type data
Of course computer store number
But unlike simple calculator also store text store color image audio video many type data
And store many different type also analyze transmit computer
This versatility one reason computer useful affect many area life
To understand computer computer science important know something computer deal different type data
Let return color
How color stored computer
The introductory problem state one way RGB triple
This possible way
RGB one many color system
For example sometimes color represented HSV triple hue saturation value
However RGB common color representation computer program
This lead deeper issue stored computer
And important anyway understand number different type data stored processed computer
This chapter deal related question
In particular look following Upon completing chapter able following How data representation related liberal education mathematics
As might guess strong connection
Computers store data term binary base number
So understand computer necessary understand binary
Moreover need understand binary basic also complication two complement notation discussed
Binary representation important computer represent data also much computer computing based
For example see chapter machine organization

That phrase often hear used describe many way computer affecting life
Another phrase might hear
What digital revolution mean
Nowadays many device digital
We digital watch digital phone digital radio digital TVs etc
However previously many device data represented continuously variable physical quantity Think example old watch second minute hour hand moved continuously although slowly minute hour hand
Compare many watch show digital representation time
This example highlight key difference analog digital device analog device rely continuous phenomenon digital device rely discrete one
As second example difference analog radio receives audio radio broadcast signal transmitted radio digital radio receives signal stream number
The digital revolution refers many digital device us effect
These device include computer also device system play major role life communication system
Because digital device usually store number using binary number system major theme chapter binary representation data
Binary fundamental computer computer science understand computer work computer scientist think need understand binary
The first part chapter therefore cover binary basic
The second part build first explains computer store different type data
Computing fundamentally information process
Each computation certain manipulation symbol done purely mechanically blindly
If represent information using symbol know process symbol interpret result access valuable new information
In section study information representation computing
The algorithm chapter discus way describe sequence operation
Computer scientist use algorithm specify computer
But algorithm useful need data computer need way represent data
conveyed content message interpreted perceived sens cause certain mental response
Information always encoded form transmission interpretation
We deal information time
For example receive information read book listen story watch movie dream dream
We give information write email draw picture act show give speech
Information abstract conveyed concrete medium
For instance conversation phone communicates information information represented sound wave electronic signal along way
Information medium carry information must
Therefore information processed communicated must process turn information data representation using symbol
People many way represent even simple number
For example number four represented IV
How computer represent number
Or text
Or audio file
The way computer represent work number different
Since early computer history standard binary number system
Computers like binary extremely easy
However binary easy human
While time people need concerned internal representation computer use sometimes
Suppose friend spending weekend cabin
The group travel two separate car agree first group arrive leave front light make easier later group
When car arrives cabin able tell light car arrived first
The light therefore encodes two possibility group already arrived group arrived yet
To convey information could use two light
For example could mean first group arrived yet first light second indicate first group arrived left get supply first second group arrived left go fishing group arrived left
Note key idea light allow different level light multiple color option two possibility
But second want represent two choice use light
This idea powerful one
There two two distinct choice state black white present absent large small rough smooth different way representing possibility
One reason idea powerful easier build camera CDs data lowest level two possible state either
In computer representation binary digit
A collection bit called
A bitstring bit long called
Bits byte important concept computer storage data transmission later explain along related terminology concept
But first look basic question computer represents number
considered father first person studied built mathematical model information communication information
He also made many significant contribution computing
His seminal paper A mathematical theory communication changed view information laying foundation information age
Shannon discovered fundamental unit information yes answer question one bit two distinct state represented two symbol
He also founded design theory digital proving proposition Boolean algebra used build logic machine capable carrying general computation manipulation two type symbol
another term closely related information abstract concept representation information
We use information representation data interchangeably
Information represented different level
It helpful separate information representation two category external representation internal representation
External representation used communication human computer
Everything see computer monitor screen whether text image motion picture representation certain information
Computers also represent information externally using sound medium touch pad blind read text
Internally modern computer represent information bit
We think bit digit two possible value
Since bit fundamental unit information sufficient represent information
It also simplest representation two symbol needed represent two distinct value
This make easy represent bit physically device capable two distinct state work
toggle switch
We see later modern computer processor made tiny switch called transistor
When bit put together sequence represent number
We familiar representing quantity number
Numbers concrete symbol representing abstract quantity
With ten finger human conveniently adopted base ten decimal numbering system requires ten different symbol
We know decimal representation use every day
For instance arabic numeral use
Each symbol represents power ten depending position symbol
So example number one hundred
We emphasize writing power digit So take know base apply base figure binary
But first recall bit binary digit byte bit
In file binary number talk one byte long
Computers actually use one byte represent number
For example number actually represented using bit byte bit byte
The bit different value represent single bit permit value bit give value bit give value bit give value general bit give value
However looking binary example usually use bit number make example manageable
This base ten system used numbering somewhat arbitrary
In fact commonly use base system represent quantity different nature base day week base minute hour hour day ounce pound
It hard imagine base two symbol simplest base system fewer two symbol represent change therefore information
When talk decimal deal mal come
In binary two digit nary
The digit binary
You never see etc
If something wrong
A bit always
Counting binary proceeds follows An old joke run There type people world
Those understand binary
The next thing think value possible one byte
Let write power two byte As example binary number Note bit either
So two possibility leftmost bit two next bit two bit two choice bit
Multiplying possibility together give possibility
In possibility represent integer bit bit
All base system work way rightmost digit represents quantity base raised zeroth power recall anything raised power result digit left represents quantity base time larger one represented digit immediately right
The binary number represents quantity decimal rightmost represents zero contribute nothing position finally leftmost one represents
When use different base system necessary indicate base subscript avoid confusion
For example write indicate number binary represents quantity decimal
The subscript mean binary tell reader represent thousand one decimal
This example also show u representation intrinsic meaning
The pattern symbol
represent different quantity depending way interpreted
There many way represent quantity remember read nine base decimal instance symbol 九 represents quantity Chinese
As quantity represented differently often change representation without changing quantity represents
As shown binary representation equivalent decimal representation representing exactly quantity
In studying computing often need convert decimal representation familiar binary representation used internally computer
Converting binary representation integer decimal representation process summing quantity binary digit represents yield result
One task need book computer scientist often need convert decimal number binary number
The last subsection showed convert binary decimal take power whose corresponding bit add power together
Suppose want decimal binary conversion
As example let convert decimal value binary
Here one technique relies successive division We take remainder get
Since usually work group bit fill eight bit add zero front
So end
In addition storing data computer also need operation addition data
How add number binary representation
Addition bit four simple rule shown four vertical column Now binary number consisting multiple bit use four rule plus carrying
Here example Here example carried bit listed explicitly carry
When kept column solution carried added next column left
We check binary operation converting number decimal binary decimal operation number different representation
If representation operation correct result consistent
Let look one time example addition problem solved
Converting decimal produce conversion verify accuracy converting give
Adding yield converted back binary indeed
But binary addition always work right Note bit result byte
Here sum decimal Note greater maximum hold number
This result condition called
Overflow issue computer go binary number however computer bit set aside result overflow mean program might run correctly
Once let start looking single bit Notice case often want get result borrow
So let apply problem base Here binary subtraction borrowing shown Most people find binary subtraction significantly harder binary addition
You might question binary representation last section
For example negative number
What number fractional part
Are difficult human work
These good question
In couple section look representation used computer science related binary
Computers good binary
Humans
Binary hard human write hard read hard understand
But want number system easier read still closely tied binary way preserve advantage binary
One possibility base
But using base greater immediately present problem
Specifically run digit ca use greater multiple digit within
So instead use letter A B C D E F
So digit using F instead decimal instead binary
We also reexamine value place
In hexadecimal place represents power
A hexadecimal number place place
For example D place place So hexadecimal number equal decimal
Note two digit hexadecimal number however represent amount information one byte binary
That largest hex number maximum bit binary
So easier u read write
When working number time representation used clear
For example represent number ten representation decimal number two representation binary number sixteen hexadecimal number
Often representation clear context
However use subscript clarify representation used example decimal versus binary versus hexadecimal
Hexadecimal number hexadecimal digit two already seen
For example consider us following power So decimal Hexadecimal appear often used place example sometimes represent memory address see future chapter color
Why useful case
Consider RGB color bit red green blue
Since bit requires hexadecimal digit color need hexadecimal digit rather bit
For example indicates color full red component green blue
Now additional type conversion problem Here couple example involving last two
Let convert binary number hexadecimal
To break two part
Now convert part decimal get
The hexadecimal digit
Instead recall C hexadecimal representation
So hexadecimal representation
Rather going binary decimal segment hexadecimal digit could go binary hexadecimal directly
Hexadecimal digit decimal binary equivalent first base hexadecimal base decimal base binary
Now let convert hexadecimal number binary
D hexadecimal representation binary
binary
Put two part together get
Again could skip intermediate conversion using hexadecimal binary column
A piece text viewed stream symbol sequence bit resulting stream bit text
Two common encoding scheme code
ASCII code use one byte bit represent symbol represent different symbol includes English alphabet lower upper case commonly used symbol
Unicode extends ASCII code represent much larger number symbol using multiple byte
Unicode represent symbol written language much
Images audio video type data
How computer represent type data fascinating complex
For example perceptual issue type sound human hear affect many number need store reliably represent music
size issue see type data result large file size standard issue might heard JPEG GIF image format issue
We wo able cover image audio video representation depth detail complicated get sophisticated
For example JPEG image rely advanced mathematical technique called discrete cosine transform
However worth examining key point image audio video file A perceived image result light beam physically coming eye triggering nerve send signal brain
In computing image simulated grid dot called picture element particular color
This work eye tell difference original image image resolution number dot used high enough
In fact computer screen us grid pixel display image text
The largest detailed photograph galaxy ever taken unveiled
The gigantic image capture million star core Milky Way
It created data gathered Visible Infrared Survey Telescope Astronomy VISTA European Southern Observatory Paranal Observatory Chile
If printed resolution newspaper would stretch foot long foot tall team behind said resolution pixel
While galaxy image obviously extreme example illustrates image even much smaller image take significant computer space
Here mundane example
Suppose image pixel wide pixel high
Each pixel stored color
How many byte take store image
This problem describes straightforward naive way store image row column store color location
The answer pixel multiplied multiplied bit per byte million byte
Note file size
If store number photograph image know image especially collection image take considerable storage space
You might also know image take
And probably heard image storage format JPEG GIF
Why image size ten hundred kilobyte rather megabyte
Most image stored direct format using compression technique
For example suppose night image entire top half image black RGB
Rather storing many time pixel upper half image efficient use shorthand
For example rather file thousand could plus number indicating many pixel starting image read line line top bottom color
This lead compressed image image contains information original image efficient representation
For example original image would taken efficient version take compression ratio
Complicated compression standard JPEG use variety technique compress image
The technique quite sophisticated
How much image compressed
It depends number factor
For many image compression ratio say possible depends image use
For example one factor complicated image
An uncomplicated image say extreme example every pixel black compressed large amount
Richer complicated image compressed le
However even complicated image usually compressed least somewhat
Another consideration faithful compressed image original
For example many user trade small discrepancy original image compressed image smaller file size long discrepancy easily noticeable
A compression scheme lose image information called scheme
One called
Lossy compression give better compression lossless loss fidelity
In addition encoding image includes metadata size image encoding standard date time created
It hard imagine video encoded series image frame synchronized audio track also encoded using bit
Suppose minute video x pixel bit per pixel frame video per second
You use encoding store bit pixel frame video
What total file size
And suppose kilobit per second download connection long take download file
This problem highlight challenge video file
Note answer file size question pixel minute frame per second approximately Gb Gb mean giga
This giga
With kilobit per second download rate take Kbps second
This hour longer many people would like wait
And time increase number pixel per frame larger full screen display video length longer download speed slower
So video file size issue
However take hour download ten minute video image file way decrease file size transmission time
For example standard MPEG make use image compression technique decrease storage size single frame also take advantage fact scene one frame usually quite similar scene next frame
There wealth information online various compression technique standard storage medium etc
It might seem first audio file take anywhere much space video
However think complicated audio music probably wo surprised audio file also large
Sound essentially vibration collection sound wave travelling air
Humans hear sound wave frequency cycle per second
To avoid certain undesirable artifact audio file need use sample rate twice highest frequency
So example CD music usually sampled Hz time per second
And want stereo effect need sample two channel
For sample want store amplitude using enough bit give faithful representation
CDs usually use bit per sample
So minute music take sample channel byte per minute
This mean minute song take hour music take MB roughly amount memory typical CD hold
Note however want download MB song connection take come second
This long time would desirable could shorter
So surprisingly compression scheme reduce considerably
For example MPEG audio compression standard compress minute song considerable reduction
In last section saw page text could take thousand byte store
Images file might take ten thousand hundred thousand even byte
Music file take million byte
Movie file take billion
There database consist trillion quadrillion byte data
Computer science special terminology notation large number byte
Here table memory amount power two approximate American English word
There still higher number smaller quantity type
Kilobytes megabyte size important enough discussing file size computer memory size know terminology abbreviation
One caution file size usually given term kilobyte megabyte etc
However quantity computer science usually given term involving bit
For example download speed often given term bit per second
Mbps abbreviation mega megabyte per second
Notice Mbps lower case MB megabyte capitalized
In context computer memory usual definition kilobyte megabyte etc
power two
For example kilobyte byte thousand
In situation however kilobyte defined exactly thousand byte
This obviously confusing
For purpose book difference usually matter
That problem approximation close enough
So example calculation find file take byte say approximately KB unless problem statement say otherwise
All representation limited multiple way
First number different thing represent limited number combination symbol use always limited physical space available
For instance represent decimal number writing piece paper size paper size font limit many digit put
Similarly computer number bit stored physically also limited
With three binary digit generate different namely conventionally represent respectively
Keep mind representation intrinsic meaning
So three bit possibly represent seven different thing
With n bit represent different thing bit either one zero total combination get limit amount information represent
Another type limit due nature representation
For example one third never represented precisely decimal format fractional part infinite number three decimal point
Similarly one third represented precisely binary format either
In word impossible represent one third sum finite list power two
However numbering system one third represented precisely one point represent power three

Learn text image sound converted binary processed computer image sound compressed create smaller file
All data inside computer transmitted series electrical signal either
Therefore order computer able process kind data including text image sound must converted form
If data converted binary series computer simply understand able process
When key keyboard pressed need converted binary number processed computer typed character appear screen
A code number represents character used convert text binary
One code use called
The ASCII code take character keyboard assigns binary number
For example Text character start number ASCII code cover special character including punctuation return key control character well number key capital letter lower case letter
ASCII code store character enough word English enough language
If want use accent European language larger alphabet Cyrillic Russian alphabet Chinese Mandarin character needed
Therefore another code called created
This meant computer could used people using different language

Networks created two computer connected
Files sent network data packet
Networks made different topology
A created one device connected together
A network small collection computer connected within building eg school business home wide collection computer connected around world
The main purpose networking share data computer
A file broken small chunk data known data packet order transmitted network
The data reach destination computer
Networking hardware required connect computer manage data packet communicated
used control data transmitted across network
There advantage disadvantage using network

What difference discrete data continuous data
Discrete data take particular value
There may potentially infinite number value distinct grey area
Discrete data numeric like number apple also categorical like red blue male female good bad
Continuous data restricted defined separate value occupy value continuous range
Between two continuous data value may infinite number others
Continuous data always essentially numeric
It sometimes make sense treat numeric data properly one type
For example something like continuous often really care much tiny difference instead group height number discrete
Conversely counting large amount discrete entity grain rice termite penny economy may choose think crucially different value instead nearby point approximate continuum
It also sometimes useful treat numeric data categorical eg underweight normal obese
This usually another kind binning
It seldom make sense consider categorical data continuous
Data always discrete
Given sample value variable maximum number distinct value variable take equal
See quote All actual sample space discrete observable random variable discrete distribution
The continuous distribution mathematical construction suitable mathematical treatment practically observable

Pitman
Data variable typically assumed drawn random variable
The random variable continuous range infinite number possible value variable take two different point range
For example height weight time typically assumed continuous
Of course measurement variable finitely accurate sense discrete
It useful distinguish ordered ordinal unordered nominal binary discrete variable
Some introductory textbook confuse continuous variable numeric variable
For example score computer game discrete even though numeric
Some introductory textbook confuse ratio variable continuous variable
A count variable ratio variable continuous
In actual practice variable often treated continuous take sufficiently large number different value
Temperatures continuous
It degree degree degree
Sex discrete
You male female classical thinking anyways
Something could represent whole number like etc The difference important many statistical data mining algorithm handle one type
For example regular regression Y must continuous
In logistic regression Y discrete
take certain value
Example number student class ca half student
data take value within range Examples In case database would always store data discrete even nature data continuous
Why I emphasize nature data
We take distribution data could help u analyze data
IF nature data continuous I suggest use continuous analysis
Take example continuous discrete
Even type sound analogy stored digital format
We analyze always analogy way
On one hand practical point view I agree Jeromy Anglim answer
In end time dealing discrete variable although theoretical point view continuous real impact instance classification
Recall Strobl paper indicating Random Forests biased towards variable multiple cutting point higher accuracy potentially similar nature
From personal experience probabilistic neural network may present also bias variable present different accuracy unless type continuous
On hand theoretical point view classical classification continuous discrete nominal etc
IMHO right
In accordance I think source name paper describing algorithm great choice
So definition implication continuous discrete relevant depending

To many philosopher science intended represent reality
For example philosopher science would say Newton theory gravity us theoretical term center mass gravitational force order represent solar system planet changing position velocity planet color change
However difficult give precise account scientific representation
More precisely though scientific representation important useful relationship hold scientific source example model theory data model target example system theoretical object
There long history within philosophy describing nature representational relationship concept object discussion representation started century philosophy science
There number different question one ask thinking scientific representation
The question received attention receive attention might called following Callendar Cohen constitution question scientific representation In virtue representation scientific source target This answered wide variety way arguing structural identity similarity ensures representation others argue pragmatic relationship
Other question scientific representation relate specifically way representation used science
These question typically asked directly certain sort representational object especially scientific model well perspective sociology science
Scientific representation became rising topic interest development semantic view theory developed partly response theory
Briefly syntactic view theoretical term defined virtue relationship equivalence observational entity Suppe
This done creation predicate calculus contained number logical operator well two set term one set filled theoretical term observational term
Each theoretical term defined term correspondence rule linking directly observational term
In way theoretical term mass given explicit observational definition
This definition used phenomenal physical term Drop ball tower way observe time ball hit ground plus logical terminology definition use theoretical term gravitational force center mass
The logical language also included number axiom relation theoretical term
These axiom understood scientific law since showed relationship held among theoretical term
Given purely syntactic relationship theory observed phenomenon need give detailed account representation relationship held
The correspondence rule syntactically related theory observation
The detail rejection syntactic view beyond scope article suffice say view structure theory widely rejected
With rejection came different account structure theory often called
Since longer direct syntactic relationship theory observation became interest explain relationship hold theory observation ultimately world
Before examining account scientific representation arose explain relationship get basic sense semantic view theory
The common feature semantic approach scientific theory thought set axiom defined syntactic correspondence theory observation
Instead theory extralinguistic entity may described characterised number different linguistic formulation Suppe
That say theory tied single formulation even particular logical language
Instead theory thought set related model
This better understood Bas van Fraassen example
Van Fraassen asks u consider set axiom constituent theory called There least one line
For two line one point lie
For two point exactly one line lie
On every line lie least two point
There finitely many point
In Figure see model show consistent since axiom satisfied model
Notice one model show consistency since model could constructed satisfy axiom like van Fraassen Seven Point Geometry
Note meant model whatever satisfies axiom theory van Fraassen
Another perhaps intuitive way expressing model theory model would make true iff model entirety universe
For example Figure entirety universe clearly would true
Notice also semantic view axiom central understanding theory
Instead important understanding theory understanding set model theory insofar satisfy theory
This account structure theory applied actual scientific theory like classical mechanic
Here following Ronald Giere take example idealized simple system physic
These argues model theory classical mechanic
For example simple harmonic oscillator model part classical mechanic
The simple harmonic oscillator described machine linear oscillator linear restoring force others Giere mathematically
This model entirety universe would make classical mechanic true
The target theoretical model semantic view always real world system
On view least one set model serve target theoretical model
These variably called empirical substructure van Fraassen data model
These way structuring empirical data typically mathematical algebraic method
When scientist gather describe empirical data tend think describe already partially structured way
Part structure result way scientist measure phenomenon particularly attentive certain feature ignoring downplaying others
Another part structuring due pattern seen data need explanation
On view notably van Fraassen empirical model phenomenon represented
That say representational relationship holding data model world least scientific practice concerned discussion see Brading Landry
Others argue relationship theoretical model data model one number interesting representational relationship described set hierarchical structure French Ladyman
With semantic account structure scientific theory place arose interest give account representational relationship
The view arose semantic view theory called substantive attempt give account representational relationship look substantive feature source target
Another way putting following Knuuttila say substantive account representation seek explain representation dyadic relationship hold source target
As discussed different deflationary pragmatic account view scientific representation least triadic relationship insofar add agent relationship
There two major classification substantive account representational relationship
The first structuralist view divided three main type isomorphism partial isomorphism homomorphism
The second category similarity view
Generically structuralist view claim scientific representation occurs virtue might called mapping relationship hold structure source structure target
part theoretical model point part data model
Isomorphism hold two object provided bijective injective surjective onto source target
Formally suppose two set set A set B
Set A isomorphic set B vice versa function call could constructed A B would take member set A map one one member set B member set B mapped
To make point clear let u suppose set A full capital letter English alphabet set B full natural number
We could create function given letter alphabet output number
Let make function easy understand let A B according typical alphabetical order
This function bijective letter mapped one one number every number picked one one letter
Notice since draw bijective function letter number also create one number letter simply let A B
Of course nothing apart ease understanding requires link A since could linked letter vice versa
Isomorphism frequently used explain representation see van Fraassen Brading Landry
Since theory semantic view group related model certain sort structure model
Most time thought mathematical model though need mathematical long structure
Van Fraassen also identifies call appearance defines structure described experimental measurement report
So appearance measurable observable structure represented target representation
On van Fraassen account theory successfully representational provided isomorphic relationship empirical substructure source appearance target isomorphic relationship theoretical model source empirical substructure target
Or rate commonly interpreted see Ladyman Bueno Suárez van Fraassen
As described Mauricio Suárez isomorphism model show identity hold relational framework structure source target
And relational framework structure maintained
So isomorphism view scientific representation scientific theory represents target phenomenon virtue bijective mapping structure theory data bijective mapping data phenomenon
Notice isomorphic view bijections account representation external theoretical language
That say relationship hold theory phenomenon internal language theory presented
This important feature account allows mapping different kind structure
Presumably mainly mathematical structure theory quite different structure data model certainly different structure phenomenon phenomenon mathematical entity
However since function external create function map different type structure one another
Isomorphism much suggest especially focusing particular theory expressed mathematically
This especially true field like physic
It seems mathematical model physic representing structure hold various real world phenomenon
For example represents way certain feature object mass rate accelerated correspond feature force
However many philosopher example Cartwright Cartwright Shomar Suárez pointed case theory model truly represents phenomenon even though feature phenomenon corresponding structure theory model due abstraction idealization
Take rather simple example billiard ball model gas French Ladyman
Drawing Mary Hesse important work model French Ladyman argue certain feature model taken representative example mass velocity billiard ball represent mass velocity gas atom
There also certain feature billiard ball example color ball
Most importantly though critique isomorphism typically also undetermined feature ball
That say feature model unknown whether representational
For detailed scientific example see Cartwright Shomar Suárez
To respond problem sort many French Ladyman Bueno French da Costa French argued isomorphism
The basic idea partial structure theory define three set member relation
The first set member relevant relation second set member relation third member unknown whether relation
It possible think set individual relation since relation semantically speaking extensionally defined could draw bijective function relation
But long third relation third set individual unknown whether relation empty isomorphism partial relation unsure whether hold target
As concrete example consider billiard ball atom example
In order partial isomorphism two must able identify two partial structure system partial structure billiard ball model partial structure gas atom
Between partial structure must bijective function map relation model relation
For example velocity billiard ball mapped velocity respective atom
There must second function map relation model feature represented
For example feature model like color billiard ball mapped feature system represented like atom
All still remain partial certain relation model unknown undefined relationship
Homomorphism defended Bartels general isomorphism insofar isomorphism homomorphism homomorphism isomorphism
Homomorphisms still rely function drawn two set require function bijective function need onto
So mean every relation part theory must map one one relation part target system
Additionally permit part relation target system unmapped
Homomorphisms allow great deal flexibility regard misrepresentation
Isomorphism place fairly strict requirement relevant constitutive feature representation view structural
But Giere point often relevant relationship
Oftentimes scientist working theory model valuable salient feature rather reason
For example modeling behavior water flowing pipe scientist often model water continuous fluid even though actually collection discrete molecule Giere
Here representational value model structure model structure world since water structurally continuous rather collection discrete molecule
Instead relevant representational value come general relationship hold modeled real world system
Giere suggests needed weaker interpretation relationship model real system
His suggestion explain representation virtue similarity
On account model represent real world system insofar similar real world system
Notice much weaker account representation structural account since similarity includes structural similarity encompasses isomorphism partial isomorphism homomorphism
Of course try hard enough notice similarity two object
For example two material object similar least insofar material
Thus Giere suggests account scientific representation appeal similarity requires implicit explicit specification relevant
Respects indicate relevant part way model taken representative
Perhaps dynamical relationship expressed equation perhaps physical similarity exists tangible model target object example plastic model benzene ring perhaps way two part model able interact one another show two object target system might interact like relevant behavior model water flowing pipe
The limitation regard claim respect similarity limited scientist know take case model target system
For example scientist could claim similarity color benzene model benzene ring since benzene ring color
Similarly scientist could claim similarity color mathematical model color specie bacteria since mathematical model color
Notice insufficient merely specify respect model similar since similarity come degree
Of course whole spectrum degree similarity particular similarity fall
A source anywhere extremely vague approximation target nearly identical target Giere call exact everywhere
Giere example The position velocity earth moon system close Newtonian model inverse square central force
Here relevant respect position velocity earth moon
The relevant degree position velocity system close Newtonian model
These respect degree thus give u account think similarity model target system
Giere us similarity describe relationship model system represent sometimes different model one model may generalization another
Theories constituted set model well hypothesis link model real world define respect degree similarity model target
More recently Michael Weisberg argued similarity account representation
In brief view argues two set thing distinguished source target attribute mechanism
In distinguishing set equation written common attribute mechanism thought intersection attribute model target system intersection mechanism model target system
The dissimilarity also identified similar fashion
He add term set weighting term function
These allow user indicate similarity important others
Rewriting equation ratio similarity dissimilarity result method make comparative judgment different model
In way able say example one model le similar another
While similarity isomorphism continue support contemporary literature especially modified version see section version described faced serious criticism
One common argument substantive view unable handle misrepresentation Suárez Frigg
Many model science accurately reflect world fact model often viewed particularly useful spite misrepresentation
Nancy Cartwright famously argued fictional account modelling made case law physic
Others shown similar thing true scientific domain Weisberg
When theory intentionally inaccurate difficulty explaining way theory representational scientist philosopher often take reference isomorphism similarity
Suárez also argued similarity isomorphism neither necessary sufficient representation
Consider first isomorphism
It must case necessary representation given scientist often take certain theory representative target even though isomorphic relationship theory target system
The true similarity
Using example suppose artist painting ocean view using blue green paint
This painting sort similarity ocean view representing one painting ocean relative side moon line vision time share certain color forth
But one relevant representative contingent discretion agent take representative ocean view certain respect Giere argued
But case turn A represents B A B similar respect A represents B
This ultimately leaf representation unexplained
Supposing give account salience attention response first problem seems possible left problem plenty salient similarity
Suárez make point Picasso The bull cry mother eye knife forth similar certain object
But painting representation thing
It representing horrible atrocity Franco
Suárez also argues similarity isomorphism insufficient representation
Consider first similarity
Take given manufactured item example Acer Chromebook computer similar many computer hundred thousand
Notice fact similarity insufficient make represent computer
Even add Giere requirement hypothesis define respect degree similarity insufficiency remain
In fact seems though hypothesis define relevant respect degree similarity computer Acer engineer quality control made sure production computer result similar computer
All even hypothesis give respect degree would want say given computer represents others
The problem hold isomorphism well
Suppose someone write equation various constant variable expressed certain relationship held part equation
Suppose odds equation turn isomorphic system say describes relationship rising water temperature reproduction rate specie fish native mountain stream Colorado Rockies
To many appears counterintuitive think representation could happen accidentally
However isomorphism sufficient representation would admit randomly composed equation represent fish specie even one ever us even recognizes isomorphic relationship
There argument view general important one lack right logical property
Drawing work Goodman Suárez Roman Frigg argue representation certain logical property shared similarity isomorphism
Representation A represents B follow B represents A
Representation A represents B B represents C follow A represents It also A represent
Since isomorphism reflexive transitive symmetric similarity reflexive symmetric property required account representation
There reply argument behalf substantive view
First general question whether justified making inference representation art representation science
As discussed many criticism substantive view draw example domain art example Suárez us many example painting drawing upon Goodman discus representation art
But taken given hold art must translate science
In fact many case practice art seem quite different practice science
As Bueno French say After particular given approach drawn abstract scientific representation
Following Anjan Chakravaratty Otávio Bueno French argue something like similarity partial isomorphism fact necessary successful representation science
If similarity isomorphism successful use model would nothing short miracle
That say similarity partial isomorphism might whole story least part story
Using aforementioned example Picasso note partial isomorphism mark canvas specific object world order understanding represents get ground
Replies made argument well
Bueno French argue account partial isomorphism meet criticism raised Suárez Frigg
Adam Toon discus way supporter similarity account representation might respond criticism
Bartels defends homomorphism account criticism
If scholar argued substantive view work explain scientific representation
Suárez argues needed instead deflationary account
A deflationary account claim substantive property relation stake debate scientific representation
Deflationary account typically marked couple feature
First deflationary account deny necessary sufficient condition scientific representation lack explanatory value regard nature scientific representation
Second account typically view representation relationship deeply tied scientific practice
As Suárez put impossible deflationary account concept representation area science variance norm govern representational practice area representation area anything practice
Already see view quite different substantive view
Each view substantive sense gave necessary sufficient condition representation
There also distinct way view detached scientific practice since whether something representational little whether accepted scientist representational feature source target
In case relationship entirely accounted feature theory model target system
As Knuuttila describes dyadic account insofar relationship held two thing
The deflationary account take markedly different direction moving least triadic account representation
In case view developed followed general lead many deflationary view giving central role work agent representation
These view qualify deflationary given still give necessary sufficient condition representation
Given importance role agent aim might call view pragmatic
Although pragmatic deflationary view importantly distinct aim share many common thread many case view could reinterpreted deflationary pragmatic little effort
As grouped together section
The earliest deflationary account representation RIG Hughes DDI Account
The DDI Account consists three part denotation demonstration interpretation
Denotation way model theory reference symbolize otherwise act target system
The sort denotation invoked Hughes broad enough include denotation concrete particular example model solar system denote particular planet denotation specific type example Bohr theory model hydrogen atom hydrogen atom denotation model global theory example particular model represented
In case model denotes something else stand particular concrete object type theoretical object type dynamical system
We might think relationship sufficient representation since fact scientist treat certain object part model symbol target system seems answer question relationship model world
Hughes though think order understand scientific representation need examine actually used scientific practice
This requires additional step analysis
The second part Hughes DDI Account demonstration
This feature model contain resource enable u demonstrate result interested
That model typically meaning scientist represent target object system also represent certain way certain feature made salient
The nature salience allows user draw certain type conclusion make certain prediction novel
This demonstration sense model vehicle insight drawn demonstrated physically geometrically mathematically forth This requires workable used certain way
The final part DDI Account interpretation
It insufficient model demonstrate particular insight
The insight must interpreted term target system
That say scientist use model vehicle demonstration part representational process defended DDI Account scientist interpret demonstrated insight result feature rather feature apply target system least way scientist thinking target system
In summary denotation moving thought target system model
We take model part stand symbolize target system object
In demonstration use model vehicle come certain insight prediction result regard relationship hold internal model
It interpretation move model back world taking result insight gained use model target system object world
After criticizing substantive account Suárez developed account representation focused centrally inference inferential capacity call inferential conception representation
As describes account involves two part
The first part call representational force
Representational force defined capacity source lead competent informed user consideration target
Representational force exist number reason
One way get representational force repeatedly use source representation target
Another way virtue intended representational us virtue intention creator author source viewed within context broader scientific community
Oftentimes representational force occur combination two
It also contextual property insofar requires agent using source relevant contextual knowledge able go source target
So example upper corner word processor little blueish square smaller white square small dark circle inside supposed image floppy disk
This representational force insofar allows go source image floppy disk target mean saving document I currently writing
In case representational force exists virtue intended representational us creator word processor surely intend symbol stand activity well repeated us I part society past repeatedly used image floppy disk get target program many others well
It also contextual someone never used computer would requisite knowledge able use icon correctly
This part story Suárez order scientific representation must something mere representational force
On view scientific representation subject sort objectivity necessarily exist representation example example save icon
The objectivity meant indicate somehow independent representational relationship exists world scientist engaged scientific representation
Instead objectivity present insofar representation constrained various way relevant feature target system represented
That real feature scientist intentionally trying represent scientific model theory representation arbitrary must respond relevant feature
So constraint objective commit Suárez identifying reified relationship hold source target
According Suárez going get objectivity representation must turn second feature capacity source allow surrogate reasoning
This second feature requires informed competent agent led draw specific inference regarding target
These inference result type long source vehicle reasoning lead agent draw inference regarding target
Suárez point source lead agent target also lead agent think target particular way coming particular insight inference respect source
More recently Suárez argued second feature capacity surrogate reasoning typically requires three thing place
First source must internal structure certain relation part identified examined
Secondly examining part source scientist must term target part
Finally must set norm defined scientific practice define limit inference correct intended
It virtue norm practice agent able draw relevant intended inference making representation part particular scientific practice
Of course take view deflationary understood necessary sufficient condition capacity surrogate reasoning rather feature frequently place
Consider example mathematical model example equation
The model supposed representational relationship
Part Suárez representational fact competent agent lead consider relationship considering source
However Suárez note insufficient scientific representation science term interact way
To account argues another feature model capacity allow surrogate reasoning
In case mean individual examine manipulate model term part multiple variable able draw certain inference nature interaction predator prey part target system
These insight occur part due nature model well norm scientific practice mean inference related phenomenon afford u recognize certain specified inference scientific interest
Suárez inferential account developed Gabriele Contessa
He explicit claim interpretational view defending deflationary account rather substantive version inferential account insofar take account give necessary sufficient condition representation
All account defends clearly pragmatic nature
Contessa begin noting important distinction drawn Suárez work difference three type representation
The first mere denotation arbitrarily chosen sign taken stand object
He give example logo London Underground denoting actual system train track
The second sort representation Contessa call epistemic representation
An epistemic representation one allows surrogate reasoning sort described Suárez
The London Underground logo feature since one would able use figure navigate
A map London Underground hand would feature insofar could used agent draw sort inference
The final sort representation call faithful epistemic representation
Whether representation faithful matter degree something faithful epistemic representation provided valid inference drawn target using source vehicle also sound
Notice require model user able draw every possible inference target rather inference licensed map drawn sound inference following source true target
In sense map London Underground produced yesterday faithful one produced
Using framework Contessa go describe scientific model epistemic representation feature particular target system
The scientific model representational user interprets source term target
He remains open multiple sort interpretation relevant suggests common sort interpretation analytic function quite similarly isomorphism every part relation source interpreted denoting one one part relation target target part relation denoted part relation source
Of course given determined agent use necessary agent believe interpretation actually case system
Here Contessa draw distinction faithfulness
Since model often misrepresentation idealization discussed need completely faithful order useful
This end story though circumstance also play important role understanding whether something scientific representation
In light insight Suárez others many view described substantive view altered updated explicitly centrally make reference role agent making could called approach
Of importance given role substantive view described recent advance made van Fraassen Giere
The view isomorphism commonly attributed van Fraassen described one drawn book More recently van Fraassen presented altered account representation place much emphasis role agent
Van Fraassen note reference agent part earlier view Ladyman Bueno Suárez van Fraassen Suárez important work deflationary account influential development view defends
He begin account looking primarily way representation used saying source representative target depends largely sometimes way source used
Though take offering substantive theory representation call primary claim account representation There representation except sense thing used made taken represent thing thus
Van Fraassen notice place restriction possibly representational
Mental image limited made used way
That say give mental state representational role
Similarly thing representation produced naturally
What representation taken used representation something happens spontaneously without influence agent
Van Fraassen also notice important distinction two way representing representation representation
When scientist take use source representational take representation target
This target change based context sometimes scientist might even use source representation
Consider van Fraassen example use graph represent growth bacterial colony certain condition graph representation bacterial growth
But could also use graph represent phenomenon perhaps acceleration object dropped height
Part capture way perspective change way representing particular appearance
Thus using source distinct way represent particular appearance particular phenomenon
In intentionally using source representation scientist make representation something also represent certain light making certain feature salient
This van Fraassen call representation
Two representation target might represent target something different
Van Fraassen offer example everything heart also kidney representing organism heart mean thing representing kidney
Similarly might represent growth bacteria mentioned example certain sort growth model worsening infection seen part disease process
Of course general van Fraassen acknowledges
However true deflationary attitude notice good way getting specific scientific representation since variable polyadicity every specification add another one
Nonetheless still maintains link good useful representation phenomenon requires similarity structure
As stand still appeal isomorphism present account A model used represent given phenomenon accurately substructure isomorphic phenomenon
Just account representation relies isomorphism structure theoretical model structure phenomenon
All still markedly different view earlier view described
No longer isomorphism structural relationship alone representational
Now van Fraassen view fact scientific community us take representational
Ian Hacking famously argued philosophical discussion role activity science much emphasis put representation
Instead suggests much done science intervening concept intervention key understanding reality science engaged
All still think science represent
Representation account human activity exhibit number different style
It people make representation typically occurs term likeness take basic concept
Representation term likeness think essential human even speculates may played role development like many think language
In creating likeness though argues analyzable relation made
Instead likeness creates term representation real
Representation view interested true false since representation precedes real
Giere also made pragmatic central explicit account scientific representation
He claim attempting understand representation science begin independent relationship substantially exists world
Instead begin activity representing
If going view activity relationship two place
He proposes relation us represent purpose
Here agent broadly construed could individual scientist le specifically group scientist
representational object including model graph word photograph computational model theory
aspect feature world aim goal representational activity reason scientist using source represent target
Giere identifies number different potential purpose representation
These include thing like learning something actually like fairly contextual depend upon question asked
So way something modeled might change depending purpose representation
Giere still working considered semantic conception theory theory set model created according set principle certain specific condition
The principle might otherwise think empirical law conceive empirical truth
Instead thinking principle scientist form model scientist construct use model make particular otherwise general idealized principle
On view model representational link empirical world
There many way scientist use model represent world Giere view important way remains similarity
Giere quick note mean need think representational relationship objective substantive relationship world
Instead scientist us model representing often virtue picking certain salient feature model similar target system
In scientist specifies relevant aspect degree similarity using act representation
One advantage updated version similarity view wide range model effectively representational account Giere
Giere give example time saw nuclear physicist treat pencil model beam proton explaining beam could polarized
It virtue similarity pencil beam photon fact physicist specifically used relevant similarity able use represent beam photon
By noting importance role agent Giere better able explain scientific representation occurs whole range scientific representation
A similar yet importantly distinct account representation similarity defended Paul Teller
Teller argues abandon called perfect model model take scientist model way perfectly correspondent real world target
Instead think model rarely ever perfect match target
This mean model representation
He argues model represent target virtue similarity though denies general account similarity given
What make something similarity depends deeply upon circumstance hand including interest model user
One way deflate problem scientific representation claim special problem scientific representation instead argue understand question scientific representation part already widely discussed literature representation general
This project taken Craig Callender Jonathan Cohen
According view representation many different field art science language forth explained fundamental representation common field
To explain appeal call General Griceanism take general framework insight Paul Grice
On General Gricean view representational nature scientific object explained term something fundamentally representational
The fundamentally representational object case mental state
This effect push hard philosophical problem back stage since account must given regard representational nature mental state
They remain uncommitted particular account representational nature mental state leaving something argued philosophy mind
All mention popular candidate functional role theory informational theory teleological theory
There view significant advantage taking General Gricean viewpoint
For one certain sort simplicity
By explaining representation term fundamental representation mental state need give wildly different explanation scientific model represents target example green light represents go driver
Each occurs virtue scientist hearer know certain mental state activated contains relevant representational content
They also explain reason similarity isomorphism commonly used though since strong pragmatic tool helping better bring relevant mental state representational content
This argue clearly one reason people Michigan use upturned left hand help explain relative location hometown upturned left hand similar shape shape Michigan
The reason similarity useful tool identical reason similarity would useful scientific context make relative instance communication effective meaning hearer user model scientific representation better able arrive relevant mental state represent target system
In short view might general philosophical problem representation anything special scientific practice make stake problem different field general problem
Of course amusingly note pass buck fundamental question Once one paid admittedly hefty fee supplying metaphysics representation mental state instance representation become extremely cheap
These deflationary pragmatic account representation avoided criticism
Many criticism presented part defense one view another
For example Contessa argues purely denotational account scientific representation one seen Callendar Cohen
As say Whereas denotation seems necessary condition epistemic representation however seem sufficient condition
As Contessa argues insufficient merely able stipulate denotational relationship sort representation useful scientist
For example might use given equation example denote relationship hold size predator prey population
But equation could successfully denote relationship much use scientist able draw many insight relationship
Therefore Contessa argues denotation necessary condition representation alone whole story
In addition suggests need interpretation term target described
Matthias Frisch raised worry addressed specifically van Fraassen account applicable many pragmatic deflationary account described
The worry take van Fraassen There representation except sense thing used made taken represent thing thus literally seems impossible model represent
Taking Frisch example say wanted construct quantum mechanical model macroscopic body water
To would solve Schrödinger equation order simply impossible practice
But turn Schrödinger equation used represent macroscopic body could never use equation way representational way
Notice concern applies pragmatic deflationary account unable make inference interpret source term target given complexity seems would able also fail representational account
But lead fairly strong conclusion use model represent system actually applied model system
For example model seems represent system scientist used represent relationship general
Frisch think argument ultimately fatal pragmatic account since argues constraint use model part scientific practice sense model example represents relationship even though yet used way
There problem extending model horizontally instance domain validity model
There Frisch argues problem extending model vertically using model represent phenomenon outside domain validity
This seen quantum mechanic example since practice place use Schrödinger equation describe macroscopic body water
So claim van Fraassen view extension pragmatic deflationary view must committed view science reduced one foundational theory denies model quantum mechanic adequately represent macroscopic phenomenon
Of course commitment might viewed desirable feature view rather flaw depending upon commitment
Another important critique applies generically number deflationary pragmatic view come Chakravartty
As described many argue deflationary pragmatic account representation offer view alternative substantive account
That say deny scientific representation adequately described substantive account merely add account rather reject offer deflationary pragmatic account instead
Chakravartty argues mistaken move
We think deflationary pragmatic account alternative substantive account rather compliment
On deflationary pragmatic account representation occurs inference made target virtue source
But one might wonder could practice facilitated successfully sort similarity representation thing miracle
That say function proponent deflationary pragmatic account take central explainer scientific representation seems require sort similarity isomorphism Bueno French
On Chakravartty view pragmatic deflationary account go far eliminating role substantive feature
In leave important part scientific representation behind
The question scientific representation received important attention context scientific modeling
There vast literature model much least tangentially related question representation
An examination literature provides opportunity see sort insight regard representation relationship world representational object
Much literature model focus various role model within scientific practice representational others
In influential volume model Margaret Morrison Mary Morgan use number example model defend view model partially independent theory data function instrument scientific investigation
We learn model due representational feature
Morrison Morgan start focusing construction model
Models account constructed combining mixing range disparate element
Some element theoretical empirical data phenomenon
Thus far view mostly line discussed section
What make model unique construction often involve outside element
These story way explaining unexpected data part theory time sort structure imposed onto data
These element argue give model sort partial independence autonomy
This true even outside element obviously present example model idealized simplified approximated version theory
This independence crucial use help understand theory data often use
According Morrison Morgan model function like tool instrument number purpose
There three main classification us model
The first interacting theory model used explore theory make usable theory otherwise unusable
They also used help understand explore area yet theory
Other time model object experimentation
The second classification use model measurement way structuring presenting measurement also function directly instrument measurement
Finally model useful designing creating technology
Models valuable insofar function
Models Morrison Morgan argue also importantly representational
Their representational value relies part way constructed theory data phenomenon
Models represent theory data representational instrument mediate data theory
Whatever case representation view taken mirroring direct correspondence model representational target
Instead representation seen kind rendering partial representation either abstract translates another form real nature system theory one capable embodying portion system
Sometimes model used represent otherwise inaccessible theory claim case simulation
The final role model described Morrison Morgan way model afford possibility learning
Sometimes learning come construction model
Most frequently though learn using model using manipulating
In learn model feature already described wide range source construction function status representation
Oftentimes learning take place internal model
In case model serf call representative rather representation
With representative insight gain manipulating model model
But come place better understand system system system
Other time take world model manipulate world inside model sort experiment
Daniela defends slightly different related account representational nature model
On account model entail certain proposition target model
As proposition subject true false
One way thinking representation model say model representational insofar entailed proposition true
However exactly right since mentioned model oftentimes intentionally entail false proposition
Since model aspect phenomenon selected fail say thing aspect phenomenon
In case proposition entailed may true one aspect false another
This call role model user decide function model way degree model inaccurate aspect phenomenon actually representing
In sum view model representational part due entailed proposition also due role model user
Tarja Knuuttila argued thinking model much emphasis placed representational feature even accounting epistemic value
Following expanding Morrison Morgan argues think model material epistemic artefact intentionally constructed thing materialized medium used epistemic endeavor multitude way
The key epistemic functioning found constrained experimentable nature
Models according account constrained construction way make certain scientific problem accessible amenable systematic treatment
This one main role idealization simplification approximation
On hand representational mean used also impose constraint modeling
The representational mode medium model constructed example diagram picture scale model symbol language scientific reasoning different way
When considered respect Knuuttila argues see model far mere representational capacity including target experimentation thought creating sort conceptual parallel reality
In addressing Weisberg take idea characteristic way model constructed indirect
This come three step process scientist first construct model analyzes refines model finally examines relationship model world Weisberg
Models used understood scientist construal model
The construal Weisberg account made four part
The first assignment identifies various part model phenomenon investigated
The second part construal scope tell u aspect phenomenon modeled
The final two part construal fidelity criterion
One dynamical fidelity criterion identifies sort error tolerance prediction model
The representational fidelity criterion give standard understanding whether model give right prediction right reason whether model linking causal structure explains aspect phenomenon modeled
This strategy science contrasted different sort strategy Weisberg call abstract direct representation
Abstract direct representation strategy science study world unmediated model
He give example Mendelev development periodic table element
This process begin hypothetical abstract model refined used representationally Weisberg think process science proceeds
Instead process start phenomenon abstract away general feature
Such distinction modelling abstract direct representation underline possibility scientific representation need achieved way
There worry Weisberg understanding process Knuuttila Loettgers press
Through close examination development model Knuuttila Loettgers argue process often begin certain sort template characteristic way modeling phenomenon typically adopted field
Such already familiar modeling method form offer modeler sort scaffolding upon imagine describe target system
They also argue another distinct feature
That developing model scientist typically eye anticipated insight feature target system wish represent
Thus view modeler pay close attention target system empirical question stage development model end Weisberg suggests
One important discussion developed primarily literature model concern idealization
Weisberg argues three different kind idealization generically describes intentional introduction distortion scientific theory
The first kind idealization call Galilean idealization
This sort idealization theory model intentionally distorted make theory model simpler order render computationally tractable
This sort idealization occurs scientist ignore certain feature system theory playing role actually happens rather including make application theory model complex gain traction problem
By removing complexity scientist distort model lack complexity reflect target
But gaining initial computational tractability slowly reintroduce complexity thus remove distortion
The second type idealization Weisberg call minimalist idealization
In minimalist idealization feature carried model theory causal feature make difference outcome
So feature target left behind without losing predictive power minimalist idealization leave feature behind
As example Weisberg note explaining Boyle law often assumed collision gas molecule
This fact false since collision gas molecule known take place gas
But low pressure gas behave collision
So since collision make difference understanding system scientist leave fact behind
Notice distinct Galilean idealization insofar minimalist idealization leave certain feature theory model make difference relevant task goal hand
Galilean idealization hand leaf certain feature even make difference simply leaving would make model complex le tractable
The final sort idealization described Weisberg call idealization
This practice using number different often incompatible model represent understand phenomenon
In case none model capable accurately modeling relevant target system
All model good representing certain feature target system
Thus using single model rather group model distorted scientist get better sense target system
Weisberg offer helpful example National Weather Service us number different model making weather forecast
Each model used represents target different way inaccurate way another
It use model permit forecast higher accuracy since attempt make single model resulted le accurate prediction
Many important insight nature scientific representation come philosophy science rather thinker would typically considered part field sociology science
The insight field serve source insight nature representation scientific practice well challenge primarily insight philosophy science
Michael Lynch Steve Woolgar edited important collection paper scientific representation practice written perspective sociology science called
More recently Lynch Woolgar edited another collection Catelijne Coopmans Janet Vertesi
Treating representation perspective sociology science involves asking different sort question one far addressed article
Instead asking constitution scientific representation sociologist science interested different question What participant treat representation Lynch Woolgar
In introduction volume Lynch Woolgar provide general overview important insight perspective
Since sociology science treat scientific practice object inquiry keen describe precisely representation actually used scientist
They note importance heterogeneity representational order
That wide range device representational well wide range way representation used useful
Importantly sociologist often interested discussing merely epistemic informational role use representation viewing significantly social contextualized otherwise embedded complex set activity practice
Sociologists science attempt pay attention whole gamut representation representational us better understand precisely role play within scientific investigation
Another important insight Lynch Woolgar note relation representation thought directional sense representation move towards originary reality
Instead directionality representation thought movement assembly line
That say representational practice must seen constructing representation also constructing phenomenon way represented
This something seen much literature sociologist science including work Latour see
In paying close attention way representation actually used sociologist science note setting discrepancy representation practice practice using composing representation
These discrepancy problem encountered actual practice science allow improvisation creativity help advance particular domain part
Sociologists science interested studying creativity productivity science also interesting phenomenon right
A particularly telling example insight especially philosophical point view provided Bruno Latour Circulating Reference Latour
Latour case study based work group scientist examining relationship savannah forest ecosystem
At end project collectively published paper finding included figure interaction ecosystem detailing change soil composition among feature
Latour asks abstract drawing take perspective individual could possibly ignores many feature ecosystem stretch land
That say drawing something made ink paper ecosystem former latter
Latour method answer take form strikingly case study present picture expedition us structure represent process describes look carefully detail step scientist got expedition figure paper
What happens say Latour series step scientist abstract world intentional fashion
In maintain relevant feature world simultaneously constructing phenomenon studying
In process representation produced also getting abstract
An example make clearer
At one stage process soil sample collected vertical stretch ground
These sample transferred device allows whole vertical stretch earth viewed synoptically
In taking sample scientist already begun construct already particular bit dirt taken representative dirt much wider area land
Once soil collected various feature soil maintained intentional action part scientist
For example scientist label soil certain sort consistency
The scientist use clever device pinhole tool various Munsell color number construction long history
In looking pinhole scientist abstract away dirt sample taking sense color done virtue construction number associated particular color
Something clearly lost namely full materiality dirt
But something also gained case number corresponds color dirt usable manipulable data
Latour essay carefully describes many transition system published figure
As claim series transition involve abstraction construction due intentional decision scientist ensures figure end reference represents system
There single gap figure world must accounted representational relation
Instead account large series gap crossed scientist action abstracting maintaining constructing discovering
This series think extended infinitely either direction
By abstracting already figure certain hypothesis might suggested would result return system gather data might basic data already gathered
On view thing world basic
Nor element
While insight sociology science literature source support criticism philosophical literature also subject criticism
One important criticism come Giere review Lynch Woolgar Giere primary target extremely constructivist nature sociology science literature
The constructivist approach claim science socially constructed science filled knowledge aimed understanding object
There thing view world understood scientist therefore world represented
The attempt explain representation framework result representation theory representation Giere
But Giere think straightforward view sort representation without representation
That say nothing world represented instance representation
This reject importance paying attention role practice representational device particular case study
All Giere argues want general account scientific representation must also go beyond historical case
Put otherwise sociology science perspective important part explaining scientific representation work leaf representation unexplained
Knuuttila take similar line criticism
While place great importance insight sociologist science think many view developed false target mind
Many sociologist science place view contrast traditional philosophical view science something perfectly represents world
The alternative suggest constructivist approach described
However Knuuttila argues motivation run problem
First select certain practice investigate rather others criterion distinguishing practice representational
In seem relying traditional account representation delineate case interest
Further seems study show representation defunct concept bound purely constructivist account science
Instead case actually complicated phenomenon scientific representation give u clue laborious art representing scientist seeking gaining new knowledge Knuuttila
We need think representation world therefore world represented
Their insight could equally contribute intermediate view reject view science still maintain science giving u knowledge real world
That simultaneously deny representation kind transparent imprint reality single determinable relationship target still affirming artificial feature scientific epistemic strategy fact enable scientist know object Knuuttila

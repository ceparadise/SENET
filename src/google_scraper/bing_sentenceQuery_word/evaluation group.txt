University California Berkeley University Washington Stanford University The evaluation computer science engineering faculty promotion tenure generally followed dictate publish perish publish standard academic meaning publish archival journal Academic Careers
Relying journal publication sole demonstration scholarly achievement especially counting publication determine whether exceed prescribed threshold ignores significant evidence accomplishment computer science engineering
For example conference publication preferred field computational artifact chip etc
tangible mean conveying idea insight
Obligating faculty evaluated traditional standard handicap career indirectly harm field
This document describes appropriate evidence academic achievement computer science engineering
Computation synthetic sense many phenomenon computer scientist engineer study created human rather occurring naturally physical world
As Professor Fred Brooks University North Carolina Chapel Hill observed Academic Careers When one discovers fact nature contribution per se matter small
Since anyone create something new synthetic field alone establish contribution
Rather one must show creation better
Accordingly research computer science engineering largely devoted establishing better property
The computer science engineering field academe composed faculty apply one two basic research paradigm theory experimentation
Generalizing theoretician tend conduct research resembles mathematics
The phenomenon abstract intellectual contribution usually expressed form theorem proof
Though conference publication highly regarded theoretical community long tradition completing revising extending conference paper submission publication archival journal
Accordingly faculty pursue theoretical work often easily evaluated traditional academic mechanism
Nevertheless discussion regarding impact apply theoretical work
As second generalization experimentalists tend conduct research involves creating computational artifact assessing
The idea embodied artifact could chip circuit computer network software robot etc
Artifacts compared lab apparatus physical science engineering medium experimentation
Unlike lab apparatus however computational artifact embody idea concept well mean measure observe
Researchers test measure performance artifact evaluating effectiveness solving target problem
A key research tradition share artifact researcher greatest extent possible
Allowing one colleague examine use one creation intimate way conveying one idea journal publishing seen effective
For experimentalists conference publication preferred journal publication premier conference generally selective premier journal Academic Careers
In way experimental research variance conventional academic publication tradition
The reason conference publication preferred journal publication least experimentalists shorter time print month v year opportunity describe work one peer public presentation complete level review evaluation per paper compared archival journal Academic Careers
Publication prestige conference inferior prestige journal significant page limitation little time polish paper
In dimension count conference superior
Brooks noted researcher synthetic field must establish creation better
Better mean many thing including solves problem le time solves larger class problem efficient resource expressive criterion visually appealing case graphic present totally new capability etc
A key point type research better property simply observation
Rather research postulate new idea mechanism process algorithm representation protocol data structure methodology language optimization simplification model etc
lead better result
For researcher field making connection idea improvement important quantifying much improvement
The contribution idea generally component larger computational system
The fundamental basis academic achievement impact one idea scholarship field
What group affected form impact vary considerably
Often beneficiary research researcher
The contribution may used directly foundation artifact may change others conduct research may affect question ask topic choose study etc
It may even indicate impossibility certain goal kill line research
Clearly much number researcher affected fundamentally influence work
Users another group might feel impact research
For purpose evaluating faculty member promotion tenure two critical objective evaluation Both aspect documented complicated simply counting archival publication
Standard publication seek validate two objective indirectly arguing editor reviewer publication must satisfied claim novelty ownership true significance high enough meet journal standard
There obvious justification view standard publication acceptable albeit indirect mean assessing impact
But challenged two count
First rationale applied conference proceeding provided carefully reviewed prestige conference computer science engineering field
Second measure impact embodied quality publication
publication standard high significance presumed high
Not paper high quality publication great significance high quality paper appear lower quality venue
Publication indirect approach assessing impact implies useful definitive
The primary direct mean assessing impact document item b letter evaluation peer
Peers understand contribution well significance
Though institution demand peer letter writer selected maximize peer stature field
membership National Academy rational basis used
From point view documenting item connection faculty member contribution effect evaluator may selected faculty member collaborator competitor industrial colleague user etc
sharpest knowledge contribution impact
If artifact involved expected letter writer familiar well candidate publication record
These writer may biased course cost collecting primary data
The promotion tenure committee take bias consideration perhaps seeking additional advice
The letter writer need familiar artifact well publication
The artifact embodiment idea
Though publication necessary obvious reason contribution relating idea previous work presenting measurement experimental result etc
artifact encapsulates information captured paper
Most artifact run allowing evaluator acquire dynamic information
Further artifact complex impossible explain characteristic better observe
Artifacts essential research enterprise essential evaluation
Some school prohibit letter evaluation writer academic affiliation
This serious handicap experimental computer scientist engineer field best researcher work industrial research lab occasionally advanced development center
collaboration occur regularly based common interest advantage company resource bring implementation complex artifact
Letters researcher le informed thoughtful insightful writer return address company
In term assessing item b significance impact letter writer generally address significance quantitative data often offered well
Examples include number downloads software artifact number user number hit Web page etc
Such measure sound indicator significance influence especially indicate peer use research popularity equivalent impact
Specifically possible write valuable widely used piece software inducing large number downloads make academically significant contribution
Developers IBM Microsoft Sun etc
every day
In case software literally new might expected synthetic field created within known
It better embodying new idea technique Brooks requires
It may improved anyone schooled art would achieve similar result
Quantitative data may imply claimed manipulated
Downloads imply software actually used Web hit imply interest
There technique Googol approach http may produce objective information Web usage example caution using number always advised
Computer science engineering synthetic field creating something new part problem creation must also shown Though standard publication one indicator academic achievement form publication specifically conference publication dissemination artifact also transmit idea
Conference publication rigorous prestigious
Assessing artifact requires evaluation knowledgeable peer
Quantitative measure impact possible may tell implied story

In C term originally meant something could assigned hence name indicating left side assignment operator since reserved word constant added language term
In special exists denote compiler address retrieved using operator program see
This type reference applied including well
Some processor provide one instruction take sometimes referred immediate short
An immediate value stored part instruction employ usually load add subtract register
The part instruction destination
The latter may implicit
A value may reside register stored elsewhere memory requiring instruction contain direct indirect address index register address value
The expression designates refers object
A addressable assignable
A modifiable allows designated object changed well examined
An expression expression
One example immediate value look consequently A value virtually kind data given instance string digit single letter
Processors often support one size immediate data
bit employing unique opcode mnemonic instruction variant
If programmer supply data value fit assembler issue Out range error message
Most assembler allow immediate value expressed data
Thus ASCII character

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

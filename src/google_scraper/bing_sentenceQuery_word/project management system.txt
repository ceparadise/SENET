That tip iceberg project manager responsible overall success project
How successfully track different aspect project
A mean managing project planning organizing managing different required aspect
Depending sophistication project management system include Project management system fall two broad category general software application project management software application
software used broad variety task necessarily project management related
Examples general software application include While general software application designed specifically project management help plan organize manage project
Spreadsheets common manual project management system
You create document easy read share project team
If needed spreadsheet password protected confidentiality
Additionally spreadsheet capability helpful managing project
You create separate tab different aspect project
You may tab schedule one communication plan one identified risk one outstanding issue one budget
You easily update section required share whole workbook individual tab required
Spreadsheets also contain formula macro automate function making easier use
Using general software application good choice project Given criterion spreadsheet would work nicely project updating firmware small number server single location
In project risk minimal firmware previously tested small number server deploy firmware impact failure would limited single location
For schedule would likely fairly simple straightforward resource extensive complicated coordination tracking project aspect unlikely
However complex project difficulty managing different aspect project
For software application specifically designed project management would make job easier
specifically designed project management many project management function task automated built
There many many project management software product available market today wide range capability
Some software focus strictly scheduling aspect project management others accommodate full life cycle project estimation invoicing customer
Get FREE access day create account
Project management system focus scheduling allow enter project task estimated time complete start stop date resource assignment
These type software typically allow manage one project single location rather separate spreadsheet project
Additionally type project management software usually allow displaying schedule various format like Gantt Program Evaluation Review Technique PERT chart
Both Gantt PERT chart show graphical representation schedule easy understand
Project management system help manage full life cycle project estimation invoicing provide extra capability company provide project management service customer
With sophisticated software application entire project lifecycle one location easily see relationship different project aspect
For example task estimated take hour end taking hour would reflected budget customer invoice generated software
Using project management specific software application good choice project requires Given criterion project management specific software application would good choice firmware upgrade project became complicated using le tested firmware version several server different location added impact failure created high risk customer

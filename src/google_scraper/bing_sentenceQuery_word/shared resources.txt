In simply physical virtual component limited availability within computer system
Every device connected computer system resource
Every internal system component resource
Virtual system resource include concretely network connection concretely memory area
Managing resource referred includes preventing releasing resource process finished using dealing multiple process wish access limited resource
Some resource notably memory storage space notion location one distinguish allocation allocation
For example allocating GiB memory single block versus allocating block size MiB
The latter known often severely impact performance free space subcategory general resource storage space
One also distinguish resource resource
Compressible resource generally throughput one CPU network bandwidth throttled benignly user slowed proportionally throttling otherwise proceed normally
Other resource generally storage one memory throttled without either causing failure process allocate enough memory typically run severe performance degradation due working set fit memory requires frequent paging progress slow significantly
The distinction always sharp mentioned paging system allow main memory primary storage compressed paging hard drive secondary storage system allow cache compressible without disastrous performance impact
Electrical power degree compressible without power without sufficient voltage electrical device run stop crash device notably mobile phone allow degraded operation reduced power consumption allow device suspended terminated much lower power consumption

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Well general question
And anyone want make implementation specific I prefer Unix related stuff
But first need know following problem generality I read single process multiple thread
Multiple thread process share thing among
I want know share
Considering process comprised address space stack heap global variable code data OS resource among shared thread
I following guessing I read thread share global variable
Also programming Java C I made thread share class level variable
So I believing thread share global variable though sure whether concept high level programming language translates low operating system level fact
Since global variable stored heap heap shared among thread
Since thread execution must stack might program counter content say function call return happen
So thread process share stack
Now I unsure sharing following thing Not sure exactly count address space
But I guess address space generally used context process thread
And since thread process reside address space parent process said thread share address space
But maintain different stack inside address space
I guess implementation specific
For example parent process selective give handle file thread
Or I mistaking OS resource mean something file
Threads different code sharing code always case
Unsure consider data
But sure global variable shared among thread
And sure local variable similarly shared
Overall I considerably confused due vague term done Operating Systems book specific detail provided online
So I trying find answer satisfy
In general register including program counter stack pointer stack
Everything else shared thread sharing process
In particular generally considered consist set thread sharing address space heap static data code segment file descriptor
An simply mapping logical address specific piece physical memory
So say thread process share address space mean accessing variable global scope thread see variable
Similarly thread may running different point code particular time permitted call global function correspond function every thread process
Most modern operating system added notion variable global scope shared
The usual example use variable
That single variable global scope modern operating system thread given local copy error library call one thread wo impact behavior thread
There additional process state shared thread process thing like process id signal handling file lock
For complete list process state shared thread need look documentation specific threading implementation
For example
That depends
If consider thread defined POSIX offered Unix system Windows familiar later ask specifically give answer essentially WanderingLogic answer explains
Linux idea thread using system call
It offer rather control parent child share
It go far essentially wrapper around internal calling specific flag create thread share next nothing parent
Look manual page detail available

Yes Linux offer POSIX style thread much besides
Threads come two perspective operating system programming language
In case variation attribute thread
A minimal definition thread stuff happens sequence one thing another
In typical machine execution model thread set register program counter
If machine set specific register stack pointer one copy per thread
From operating system perspective minimum operating system need support thread provide way switch
This happen either automatically thread make explicit request cooperative multitasking case thread sometimes called
There also hybrid model preemption cooperative yield
preemption thread different group task explicit yield thread
Switching thread involves minimum saving register value old thread restoring register value new thread
In multitasking operating system provides treat term synonym OS context task resource particular address space also open file privilege etc
Isolation provided operating system entity process
Each task normally least one thread task execute code much use
The operating system may may support multiple thread task example original Unix
A task still run multiple thread arranging switch require special privilege
This called especially Unix context
Nowadays Unix system provide kernel thread particular way multiple thread process running different processor
Most operating system resource apart computation time attached task thread
Some operating system example Linux explicitly delimit stack case thread OSes kernel know anything stack part heap far concerned
The kernel also typically manages kernel context thread data structure containing information thread currently let kernel handle multiple thread blocked system call time
As far operating system concerned thread task run code different position code different program counter value
It may may happen certain part code program always executed specific thread usually common code
utility function called thread
All thread see data otherwise considered different task data accessed particular thread usually solely purview programming language operating system
In programming language storage shared thread program
This model concurrent programming popular also programmer need careful data accessed multiple thread occur
Note even local variable shared thread usually mean variable whose name valid one execution function another thread obtain pointer variable access
There also programming language thread storage communication happens sending message communication channel
This model concurrent programming
main programming language focus message passing execution environment lightweight handling thread encourages program written many thread contrast programming language creating thread relatively expensive operation runtime environment ca support large number thread time
Erlang sequential subset part language happens within thread particular data manipulation mostly purely functional thus thread send message another thread containing data neither thread need worry data modified thread using
Some language blend two model offering storage without type system distinguish storage location global one
storage usually convenience feature allows variable name designate different storage location different thread
Some difficult may interest understand thread By posting answer agree

Follow u Imagine assigned task pushing heavy hill
You allowed recruit people anything else help move car
You got two choice You look around one person big strong enough could grab several average people push together
While might eventually find someone large enough push car alone time easier gather group people
It might sound strange use principle
When computational problem really complex take single long time process million day case
Even processing limitation
They also rare expensive
Many research facility require lot computational power access supercomputer
For organization shared computing often attractive alternative supercomputer
Shared computing kind
A shared computing system network computer work together accomplish specific task
Each computer donates part processing power sometimes resource help achieve goal
By networking thousand computer together shared computing system equal even surpass processing power supercomputer
Most time computer using computational resource
There time might computer actually using

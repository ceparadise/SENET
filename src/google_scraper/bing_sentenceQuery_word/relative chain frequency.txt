A relative frequency table show number people chose steak compared number people tasting
Take look new chart
Get FREE access day create account
To find relative frequency steak choice need take frequency choice divide number
We dividing total number people tasted steak
The number third column relative frequency number
You actually take number convert pie chart like
Since looking people tasted steak taster
The relative frequency number converted percentage show percentage people chose type steak
A year later Steven Renee putting chili part charity fundraiser friend
There seven different type chili entered contest
The following frequency table show chili chosen best taste test
The first column number assigned type chili
The second column show tally many people chose type chili third show frequency number
A total people tasted chili
Take moment pause video
Try find relative frequency type chili
How
Remember find relative frequency need divide number total number value data set case
These number I got relative frequency table
Chili number received vote contest
Frequency table relative frequency table great way visualizing popularity data finding mode data set

A competitiveness depends great extent quality human resource
The productivity workforce ability learn relearn acquire new skill competency commitment excellence inevitably enhance national competitiveness
Thus Malaysia continues focus improving workforce constant training lifelong learning stay competitive
Investment corporate training Malaysia aim build world class workforce given greater emphasis Ninth Malaysia Plan
The government allocated RM million Ninth Malaysian Plan corporate training includes industrial commercial management training hence increasing supply educated skilled human resource support expansion education training institution
The emphasis given government corporate training obvious due effect direct indirect employee motivation organizational commitment Meyer Allen
Some organization planning invest development new skill employee enable handle issue currently present likely come future
Hence purpose study close gap perceived effectiveness respect training method used relevant literature shedding light relationship perceived training effectiveness regard training method
This study replicates study et al
also intends explore perception management level employee training method approach employed management training gap rhetoric surrounding supposed value method reality term outcome
Learning Development professional faced number challenge regarding training development staff namely increased number employee train increased complexity type work employee required perform tool used work pressure employee learn demonstrate new competency faster higher level rapid change business environment limited funding achieve
Many organization turned modern method delivery rely conventional contact trainer trainee
Companies exploring use course training delivery system cut expense reduce reliance travel Juptner
Today level development training material risen dramatically consequence new exciting opportunity provided World Wide Web www
New training delivery method continue expand growth computing technology increased information technology competency reduced barrier accessing using Internet
Effective strategy training instruction focus building virtual learning community making technology used mediate communication seamless transparent possible order efficiently effectively reach many learner possible
Today application technology example computing technology example instructional design form enhanced range training method available practitioner
Many organization turned modern method delivery
However much rhetoric surrounded use technique distance learning method
Consequently purpose study explore perception employee training method compared training method

In construction must undertake actually draw graph
After setting use assign data value one class count number data value fall class draw height bar
These height determined two different way interrelated frequency relative frequency
The frequency class count many fall certain class wherein class greater frequency higher bar class lesser frequency lower bar
On hand relative frequency requires one additional step measure proportion percent data value fall particular class
A straightforward calculation determines relative frequency frequency adding class frequency dividing count class sum frequency
To see difference frequency relative frequency consider following example
Suppose looking history grade student grade class corresponding letter grade A B C D The number grade give u frequency class To determine relative frequency class first add total number data point
Next divide frequency sum
The initial data set number student fall class letter grade would indicative frequency percentage second data set represents relative frequency grade
An easy way define difference frequency relative frequency frequency relies actual value class statistical data set relative frequency compare individual value overall total class concerned data set
Either frequency relative frequency used histogram
Although number along vertical axis different overall shape histogram remain unchanged
This height relative whether using frequency relative frequency
Relative frequency histogram important height interpreted probability
These probability histogram provide graphical display used determine likelihood certain result occur within given population
Histograms useful tool quickly observe trend population order statistician lawmaker community organizer alike able determine best course action affect people given population

A Pareto chart also called Pareto distribution diagram vertical value plotted decreasing order relative frequency left right
Pareto chart extremely useful analyzing problem need attention first taller bar chart represent frequency clearly illustrate variable greatest cumulative effect given system
The Pareto chart provides graphic depiction theory maintaining output given situation system produced input
The Pareto chart one seven basic tool quality control
The chart shown horizontal axis portrayed height bar
A graph show cumulative relative frequency may superimposed bar graph
Because value statistical variable placed order relative frequency graph clearly reveals factor greatest impact attention likely yield greatest benefit
A Pareto chart used quickly identify business issue need attention
By using hard data instead intuition question problem influencing outcome
In example XYZ Clothing Store seeing steady decline business
Before manager customer survey assumed decline due customer dissatisfaction clothing line selling blamed supply chain problem
After charting frequency answer customer survey however clear real reason decline business nothing supply chain
By collecting data displaying Pareto chart manager could see variable influence
In example parking difficulty rude sale people poor lighting hurting business
Following Pareto Principle area focus attention build business back

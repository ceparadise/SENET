process establishing maintaining consistency product performance functional physical attribute requirement design operational information throughout life
The CM process widely used military organization manage change throughout system
Outside military CM process also used IT service management defined segment
CM applied life cycle system provides visibility control performance functional physical attribute
CM verifies system performs intended identified documented sufficient detail support projected life cycle
The CM process facilitates orderly management system information system change beneficial purpose revise capability improve performance reliability maintainability extend life reduce cost reduce risk liability correct defect
The relatively minimal cost implementing CM returned many fold cost avoidance
The lack CM ineffectual implementation expensive sometimes catastrophic consequence failure equipment loss life
CM emphasizes functional relation part subsystem system effectively controlling system change
It help verify proposed change systematically considered minimize adverse effect
Changes system proposed evaluated implemented using standardized systematic approach ensures consistency proposed change evaluated term anticipated impact entire system
CM verifies change carried prescribed documentation item system reflects true configuration
A complete CM program includes provision storing tracking updating system information component subsystem system basis
A structured CM program ensures documentation requirement design test acceptance documentation item accurate consistent actual physical design item
In many case without CM documentation exists consistent item
For reason engineer contractor management frequently forced develop documentation reflecting actual status item proceed change
This process wasteful term human resource minimized eliminated using CM
Configuration Management originated technical management discipline hardware material standard practice virtually every industry
The CM process became technical discipline sometime late DoD developed series called series subsequently issued
In series consolidated single standard known replaced pursuant general DoD goal reduced number military standard favor industry supported SDO
This marked beginning evolved widely distributed accepted standard CM
Now widely adopted numerous organization agency CM discipline concept include SE ILS CMMI project management method ITIL
Many function model redefined CM traditional holistic approach technical management
Some treat CM similar librarian activity break change control change management separate stand alone discipline
CM practice handling change systematically maintains time
CM implement policy procedure technique tool manage evaluate proposed change track status change maintain inventory system support document system change
CM program plan provide technical administrative direction development implementation procedure function service tool process resource required successfully develop
During system development CM allows track requirement throughout acceptance operation maintenance
As change inevitably occur requirement design must approved documented creating accurate record system status
Ideally CM process applied throughout
Most professional mix get confused AM inventory asset hand
The key difference CM AM former manage financial accounting aspect
The CM process item comprises five distinct discipline established
These discipline carried policy procedure establishing performing standard process
The process also activity add Release management delivery
The five discipline The traditional software configuration management SCM process looked upon practitioner best solution handling change software project
It identifies functional physical attribute software various point time performs systematic control change identified attribute purpose maintaining software integrity traceability throughout software development life cycle
The SCM process defines need trace change ability verify final delivered software planned enhancement supposed included release
It identifies four procedure must defined software project ensure sound SCM process implemented
They These term definition change standard standard essentially
The ITIL specifies use Configuration management system CMS CMDB mean achieving industry best practice Configuration Management
CMDBs used track Configuration Items CIs dependency CIs represent thing enterprise worth tracking managing limited computer software software license rack network device storage even component within item
The benefit includes able perform function like root cause analysis impact analysis change management current state assessment future state strategy development
Example system commonly identifies system include
For CM defined management security feature assurance control change made hardware software firmware documentation test test fixture test documentation throughout life cycle information system
CM information assurance sometimes referred ecure onfiguration anagement relies upon performance functional physical attribute IT platform product environment determine appropriate security feature assurance used measure system configuration state
For example configuration requirement may different function part organization Internet boundary versus one function internal local
Configuration management used maintain understanding status complex asset view maintaining highest level serviceability lowest cost
Specifically aim ensure operation disrupted due asset part asset overrunning limit planned lifespan quality level
In military type activity often classed mission readiness seek define asset available type mission classic example whether aircraft board aircraft carrier equipped bomb ground support missile defense
Configuration management used maintain configuration file
Example system include
Many system utilize define maintain configuration
A theory configuration maintenance worked practical implementation present day computer system software able perform real time repair well preventive maintenance
Understanding state asset major component essential element preventive maintenance used maintenance repair overhaul system
Complex asset aircraft ship industrial machinery etc
depend many different component serviceable
This serviceability often defined term amount usage component since new since fitted since repaired amount use life several limiting factor
Understanding near end life component major undertaking involving record keeping recent development software
Many type component use electronic sensor capture data provides live
This data analyzed board remote location computer evaluate current serviceability increasingly likely future state using algorithm predict potential future failure based previous example failure field experience modeling
This basis predictive maintenance
Availability accurate timely data essential order CM provide operational value lack often limiting factor
Capturing disseminating operating data various support organization becoming industry
The consumer data grown numerous complex growth program offered original equipment manufacturer OEMs
These designed offer operator guaranteed availability make picture complex operator managing asset OEM taking liability ensure serviceability
A number standard support include configuration management including More recently configuration management applied large construction project often complex huge amount detail change need documented
Construction agency Federal Highway Administration used configuration management infrastructure project
There configuration management tool aim document change order RFIs order ensure project stay schedule budget
These program also store information aid maintenance modification infrastructure completed
One application ccsNet tested case study funded Federal Transportation Administration FTA efficacy configuration management measured comparing approximately complete construction Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency LACMTA segment Red Line billion rail construction project

None u relish audit outsider poking around hole system
When someone say audit probably think surprise inspection company auditor pull try expose IT weakness see Incomplete Audits
But one hot seat organization get hacked
If responsible information security want insist thorough annual audit
In case may choice
Financial institution example required external auditor certify compliance regulation
Your organization audit department may require
Or potential partner customer may insist seeing result business company put asset risk
So bring auditor
But job correctly
You still one feeling heat attacker brings Web site steal customer financial information
Do let happen
And wo know Intelligently evaluate ultimate deliverable auditor report
An audit anything analysis business practice sysadmin monitoring
The scope audit depends goal
The basic approach performing security assessment gather information targeted organization research security recommendation alert platform test confirm exposure write risk analysis report
Sounds pretty simple become quite complex
Your security policy foundation
Without established policy standard guideline determine level risk
But technology change much rapidly business policy must reviewed often
Software vulnerability discovered daily
A yearly security assessment objective third party necessary ensure security guideline followed
Security audit deal
Do wait successful attack force company hire auditor
Annual audit establish security baseline measure progress evaluate auditor professional advice
An established security posture also help measure effectiveness audit team
Even use different auditor every year level risk discovered consistent even decline time
Unless dramatic overhaul infrastructure sudden appearance critical security exposure year good report cast deep shadow doubt previous audit
If year internal external security review serve baseline consider using two auditor working separately confirm finding
It expensive nearly expensive following bad advice
If practical engage parallel audit team least seek second opinion audit finding require extensive work
start interviewing audit firm
If security breach system outside scope audit could mean poor incomplete job defining objective
Let take limited audit example detailed objective
Let say want auditor review new Check Point firewall deployment Red Hat Linux platform
You would want make sure auditor plan You may tempted rely audit internal staff
Do
Keeping patch making sure OSes application securely configured monitoring defense system already job
And matter diligent outsider may well spot problem missed
Technical audit identify risk technology platform reviewing policy procedure also network system configuration
This job computer security professional
Consider point hiring process Look auditing team real credential
Do influenced
Certifications guarantee technical competence
Make sure auditor actual work experience security field acquired year implementing supporting technology
Résumés auditor detail security project audit worked including reference
experience implementing supporting security technology give auditor insight subtle issue could reveal serious security exposure
Any published work included demonstrate auditor expertise
In general talk audit especially outside auditor talking security assessment review
A complete security assessment includes penetration testing internal external system well review security policy procedure
It cooperative rather adversarial exercise learn security risk system mitigate risk
There kind audit much narrower focus far le value
In scenario harm good Some IT manager enamored black box auditing attacking network outside knowledge internal design
After hacker perform digital reconnaissance launch attack ca auditor
A black box audit effective mechanism demonstrating upper management need increased budget security
However drawback emulating action malicious hacker
Malicious hacker care rule engagement care breaking
They plenty time gather information concern break process
Who owns first router network client service provider
A malicious hacker would care
Try hacking ISP altering site DNS record break network maybe get visit FBI
A black box audit view single perspective effective used conjunction internal audit limited
Audit department sometimes like conduct surprise inspection hitting organization without warning
The rationale behind approach test organization response procedure
In reality usually attempt catch someone pant rather proactive effort improve organization security posture
Surprise inspection backfire badly critical work interrupted fire drill
Think trading floor getting flooded port scan prime business hour
Some auditor seem believe organization take extra security measure know audit pending
In reality even organization performs quick cleanup wo disguise embedded security problem
Surprise inspection run risk causing much service interruption actual hacker attack
And impressed people call
Many ethical hacker wardrobe upgrade
Do homework
Network people know trust industry
Find know prospective auditing firm
See track client used firm reference list
Find right fit
Meet range auditing firm
Consider small firm specializing security along Big accounting firm see best meet need
An auditing firm need know review policy procedure internal external system network application limited scope review specific system
Smaller firm may choose bid project larger company may want bother review one system reluctant certify system without looking entire infrastructure
Insist detail
Some firm may reluctant go great detail method without contract
They may simply slide sale brochure across table say Our record speaks
Do hoodwinked nice know combined year security expertise tell lot plan proceed audit
If serious bidding business auditor put together SOW detail plan meet objective methodology deliverable engagement
The devil detail good SOW tell lot expect
The SOW basis project plan
The SOW include auditor method reviewing network
If balk saying information proprietary may simply trying hide poor auditing method simply running scanner analysis
While auditor may protect source proprietary tool use able discus impact tool plan use
Most good auditor freely discus method accept input organization staff
Basic methodology reviewing system includes research testing analysis
Agree appropriate payment plan
The bottom line bid much cost getting money
Some auditing firm quote flat rate return report detailing finding recommendation
Others may estimate number day audit take side agreeing flexible cost within limit
For complex audit entire company many unanticipated issue could arise requiring extensive time auditor making flat rate attractive contracting organization
If organization good documentation scope limited flexible rate may economical
Auditors must make certain assumption bidding project access certain data staff
But auditor board assume anything everything spelled writing receiving copy policy system configuration data
These assumption agreed side include input unit whose system audited
Nobody like surprise
Involve business IT unit manager audited system early
This smooth process perhaps flag potential Gotchas
dispute auditor access
Consider case one respected auditing firm requested copy system password firewall configuration file
One targeted organization flatly refused
In fact thought request social engineering test
Their security policy prohibited external release file requiring privileged access read
If audited organization involved process start problem like might avoided
So advance
Your manager time day testing method limit impact production system
Most organization concede social engineering attack difficult counter may restrict scope audit

Make sure handling proprietary information
If organization forbids employee communicating sensitive information nonencrypted public auditor must respect
The audit report contains proprietary data handled appropriately hand delivered marked proprietary encrypted sent

Give auditor authorizing probe network
This get jail free card faxed ISP may become alarmed large volume port scan address space
As part prep work auditor reasonably expect provide basic data documentation need navigate analyze system
This obviously vary scope nature audit typically include The entire process analyzing testing system security part overall plan
Make sure auditor detail plan front follows
For instance using Check Hat example cited general outline would include analyzing testing vulnerability The auditor begin reviewing relevant policy determine acceptable risk
They check unauthorized implementation rogue wireless network unsanctioned use remote access technology
The auditor next confirm environment match management inventory
For example auditor may told server Linux Solaris platform review show Microsoft server
If auditing team selected Unix expertise may familiar Microsoft security issue
If happens want auditor get Microsoft expertise team
That expertise critical auditor expected go beyond obvious
Auditors often use security checklist review known security issue guideline particular platform
Those fine guide
They substitute platform expertise intuition born experience
The auditor use reputable vulnerability scanner check OS application patch level database see cover story How Vulnerable
reported vulnerability
Require scanner database current check vulnerability target system
While vulnerability scanner decent job result may vary different product different environment
The auditor use several tool see The Auditor Toolbox method confirm finding importantly experience
For example sharp auditor experience know many sysadmins temporarily open system privilege transfer file access system
Sometimes opening get closed
A scanner might miss cagey auditor would look
Discovering security vulnerability live production system one thing testing another
Some organization require proof security exposure want auditor exploit vulnerability
This dangerous
A successful system compromise may graphic way convince management danger exposure prepared risk compromising even bringing live system
The SOW specify parameter testing technique
And auditor coordinate rule engagement IT people business manager target system
If actual testing feasible auditor able document step attacker could take exploit vulnerablility
For example system password file overwritten anyone specific group privilege auditor detail would gain access privilege actually overwrite file
Another method prove exposure would leave harmless text file protected area system
It inferred auditor could overwritten critical file
The audit done
Did get money worth
If finding follow standard checklist could apply organization answer
If see page report generated vulnerability scanner independent analysis answer
While commercial vulnerability scanner excellent reporting mechanism auditor prove skill interpreting result based environment review organization policy
That analysis reflect organization risk
Tools lack analytical insight often yield false positive
You hired expert people tool audit system
So know auditor risk assessment accurate
For starter IT staff review finding testing method provide written response
The auditor analysis follow established criterion applied specific environment
This help determine remedy implement
Specifically report outline The auditor report include brief executive summary stating security posture organization
An executive summary require degree computer science understood
A statement fingerd found system convey anything meaningful executive
Information like detail report review technical staff specify level risk
Finally occasion auditor fail find significant vulnerability
Like tabloid reporter slow news day auditor inflate significance trivial security issue
What say nothing say
Rather inflate trivial concern auditor detail testing method acknowledge good security posture
To add value could point area future concern suggest security enhancement consider
However clear audited system security health good dependent recommendation
Remember purpose audit get accurate snapshot organization security posture provide road map improving
Do right regularly system secure passing year

Configuration management one process overarch process service lifecycle phase ITIL
Wthout effectiveness rest process serious jeopardy
By If I implement ITIL scratch I pick Service Asset Configuration Management SACM frontline soldier
It one process overarch process service lifecycle phase ITIL
And without efficient SACM effectiveness rest process serious jeopardy
SACM combination two process work common platform yet handled discrete process asset management configuration management
Asset management deal logistics service asset like changing ownership physical movement commission decommissions disposal among others
Configuration management work closely design architecture service
It draw relationship configuration item CI vital resolving incident tracking change release finding root cause problem charting technical service catalog
As dependency configuration management across process especially service operation make logical sense implement first
It foundation upon build stable IT service management environment
Sometime back I discussed document contains aspect service drafted service implemented
Similar plan needed run configuration management effectively implementing process
Configuration manager owns configuration management process accountable drafting plan well
Here basic component CMP To ensure validity highlight rightful owner data source section reference listing data source service necessary
This help configuration manager point finger right source question raised
I would go one step ahead attach received data email plan
During one implementation I named CIs way Type CI Server Router etc Location Complexity Running sequence So router something like
A team like service desk least level capability make decision
In example could easily decode CI router placed specific location handled support team
So essence outage minimized team directly involved resolution couple functional escalation thankfully avoided
A fellow consultant went one step ahead hard coded CIs contain name team
My argument would happen CI name different team took ownership let say organizational rejig scenario
Would start naming CIs
Most organization call two change freeze one Christmas Easter
I found apt take baseline change freeze period perform analysis need
The CMP must specify change management process interface configuration management process
And point change activity configuration management process called upon
Verification process done configuration manager regular basis mostly tool based
Modern tool capable providing report help verify CI data
For example every CI field CMDB tool pull report CIs fully complete
Or state parent state child noted discrepancy come one report configuration manager use
Audits hand generally performed somebody configuration manager team member
In audit sample number CIs picked randomly verified actuals
Let say going scanner
The auditor first check CI server first place whether located data center rack per CMDB
The server checked whether loaded Windows contains RAM among attribute per database
An audit report prepared based finding configuration manager get major minor NC depending degree discrepancy
Well audit work aspect like often must conducted degree set major tag action performed configuration manager major NC shoved face noted CMP
According six section everything rest like introduction purpose role responsibility definition training etc
merely page filler done one discretion
It critical think process visualize process plan process supposed
Does meet KPI requirement importantly customer requirement
If question suggestion give shout
Glad help

With reference last part answer given A relationship optional mandatory mean foreign key column allows NULL disallows NULL respectively
I creating relationship MySQL Workbench whether I keep foreign key column MANDATORY effect
Even I ca enter NULL value
I explicitly choose particular foreign key allowing NULL I able store NULL value
So I want ask correct behaviour problem MySQL Workbench MySQL
Thanks Answer Bugs MySQL Workbench
Solution The workbench appears get confused time I noticed I need firstly delete existing relationship manually remove artifact left table relationship
Then relationship
For relationship workbench indicate whether mandatory filled pink diamond icon mandatory unfilled pink diamond
For identifying relationship seeing key indicate primary key
I complaining bug community edition though
workbench software get
If hand running standard edition contact MySQL
I running MySQL Workbench CE Rev
Cheers This sound like issue design tool I familiar
Foreign key constraint always optional SQL
That foreign key require row referencing table requires every referencing row corresponding one table referenced parent table
This one way ER modelling map well SQL database
You draw picture mandatory N N relationship ER diagram practical purpose implement SQL effectively always
Although nullable foreign key permitted I recommend
Nulls foreign key likely cause problem incorrect result later work differently different DBMSs tend properly understood even expert user

I working MS Visio
This relevant part ERD The relationship Event Adventure correct foreign key Event Adventure FK part Event primary key
However I ca figure make relationship line Adventure AccomodationType one Event Adventure without making relationship part PK adventure
When I look property relationship line I want But checkbox third property greyed toggle I make relationship
The way I could figure disconnect two column tab checkbox I lose foreign key property accomType column relationship symbol correct line remains dotted
How I make cardinality line left appear relationship line right without adding accomType PK Adventure
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
identifies problem way Visio automatically insert foreign key create relationship entity It indeed seems typing foreign key field name first establishing relationship make possible
Req foreign key automatically Optional relationship
There two way solve problem depending whether creating new relationship diagram trying fix existing one
Before creating relationship add desired FK attribute child entity using name PK parent entity
Make sure Req option checked FK attribute
In example add name attribute Adventure entity Now adding relationship automatically creates FK preserve state existing attribute Adventure You free rename FK attribute however like point
Note Child parent Optional still grayed
Even point changing property relationship attribute involved sometimes undesired side effect may find wrong crow foot symbol getting stuck
Fortunately quicker way fix deleting relationship starting
Select relationship stuck crow foot symbol go Definition tab Database Properties window
You see line arrow connecting PK FK attribute parent child entity
Select connected attribute table disconnect clicking button middle column
If key compound see multiple pair attribute Once disconnected attribute involved relationship Child parent Optional box Miscellaneous tab become active
Set property relationship Optional parent double check FK attribute child entity set Req go back Definition tab PK FK attribute Visio automatically add foreign key column creating new relationship
To change mandatory relationship set required attribute column In entity properies tab column

A relationship context database situation exists two relational database table one table foreign key reference primary key table
Relationships allow relational database split store data different table linking disparate data item
For example bank database table store customer data primary key column named also store customer data table hold information various bank account associated customer
To link two table determine customer bank account information corresponding column must inserted table referencing existing customer IDs table
In case table column foreign key reference column name table
This example relationship two table
The fundamental feature differentiates relational database database type ability define relationship

A relationship refers relationship table database parent row one table contains several child row second table vice versa
relationship often tricky represent
The relationship usually mirror relationship object two table represent
A database used school application taken example
Two table contains Student Subject
In real life student take several subject simultaneously subject studied several student time
This relationship
In database relationship broken intermediary table
In school example may take form third table contains column Semester Year
For student take certain subject certain semester certain year row entered table
The read Student master table read Subject master table
In way many student related many subject
Another example relationship employee department
Each department number employee working specific task
Similarly employee also work multiple department one time
Therefore number department employee simultaneously linked creating intermediary table link using

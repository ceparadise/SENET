What purpose naming constraint unique primary key foreign key
Say I table using natural key primary key What benefit naming PK bring
Eg
Replace With Sorry data model best I new
Here pretty basic reason
If query insert update delete violates constraint SQL generate error message contain constraint name
If constraint name clear descriptive error message easier understand constraint name random name lot le clear
Particulary ok might phone ask mean
If constraint need modified future yes happens hard know named
ALTER TABLE MyTable drop CONSTRAINT um And create one instance database scratch use default name two name ever match
If person get support code aka DBA waste lot pointless time dealing case case Sunday quite probably position identify code came able react accordingly
To identify constraint future
want drop future unique name
If specify name database engine probably assign weird name
containing random stuff ensure uniqueness
It keep DBAs happy let schema definition production database
When code randomly violates foreign key constraint sure hell save time debugging figure one
Naming greatly simplifies debugging insert update
It help someone know quickly constraint without look actual constraint name give info need
So I know primary key unique key default key well table possibly column involved
By correctly naming constraint You quickly associate particular constraint data model
This give u two real advantage By posting answer agree

I learning SQL stumbled CONSTRAINT
I define like like Why I give name
Why I give name
As I see example situation mind I ca reuse
So benefit giving name CONSTRAINT
There significant benefit giving explicit name constraint
Just example It seems using PostgreSQL difference actually big
This system generated name PostgreSQL actually somewhat meaningful
But still easier understand Think error message better understand In Oracle even worse system generated contain hint wrong You specify RDBMS
following point apply SQL Server I guess quite likely RDBMSs
You need know name constraint also name constraint appears constraint violation error message giving explicit name make meaningful SQL Server auto generate name constraint tell nothing intent constraint
Constraints object SQL manner PK FK Table almost anything else
If give constraint name easily drop required say example sort bulk data import
If give name still drop however find name SQL give
If constraint violated name error message help debug present error message user

In wherein stated form
Constraints differ common language specify step sequence step execute rather property solution found
This make constraint programming form
The constraint used constraint programming various kind used
A B true
others
Constraints usually embedded within programming language provided via separate
Constraint programming expressed form embeds constraint
This variant logic programming due Jaffar Lassez extended specific class constraint introduced
The first implementation constraint logic programming
Instead logic programming constraint mixed
Programming language support constraint include functional programming imperative programming
Mostly constraint implemented imperative language via separate library existing imperative language
Constraint programming embedding constraint host language
The first host language used language field initially called
The two paradigm share many important feature like logical variable
Today implementation include one library constraint logic programming
The difference two largely style approach modeling world
Some problem natural thus simpler write logic program natural write constraint program
The constraint programming approach search state world large number constraint satisfied time
A problem typically stated state world containing number unknown variable
The constraint program search value variable
Temporal concurrent constraint programming TCC temporal concurrent constraint programming MJV variant constraint programming deal time
Languages programming follow one two approach typical example refinement model typical example perturbation model
The refinement model general restrict variable single value lead several solution problem
However perturbation model intuitive programmer using mixed imperative constraint language
The constraint used constraint programming typically specific domain
Some popular domain constraint programming Finite domain one successful domain constraint programming
In area like constraint programming often identified constraint programming finite domain
All example commonly solved SMT solver
Finite domain solver useful solving often based one approximation
The syntax expressing constraint finite domain depends host language
The following program solves classical puzzle constraint logic programming The interpreter creates variable letter puzzle
The operator used specify domain variable range set value
The constraint mean two variable take value zero
When interpreter evaluates constraint reduces domain two variable removing value
Then constraint considered reduce domain simply stored
The last constraint specifies digit assigned letter must hold letter replaced corresponding digit
From constraint solver infers
All stored constraint involving variable M awakened case constraint remove value domain remaining variable
Constraint propagation may solve problem reducing domain single value may prove problem solution reducing domain empty set may also terminate without proving satisfiability unsatisfiability
The literal used actually perform search solution
Constraint programming often realized imperative programming via separate library
Some popular library constraint programming

I created table named Later I found I need column I want remove column I tried warning message appeared saying drop column table owned SYS I thought I must remove foreign key constraint first drop table work
I used since I name constraint therefore ca use following statement I using oracle database You use also drop constraint related column More detail regarding drop column clause found
If want find constraint actually named
want drop constraint column query system catalog That return something like different value system
And name used drop constraint More detail system catalog found The answer good enough situation need automate across multiple database generated constraint name may different something like By posting answer agree

I need create check constraint problem face list value accepted constraint change future ex red green blue next month red green blue white
How
You foreign key constraint
You create check constraint following definition But altering check constraint definition without dropping recreating thus requiring row revalidated new definition To modify constraint must first delete existing constraint new definition
This trivial Foreign Key constraint Though I probably introduce surrogate key table rather storing string repeatedly main table
using check constraint somehow correct using foreign key lookup table advantage lookup table
NB It possible check constraint reference scalar UDF turn reference table approach avoided
It simulate foreign key correctly

Jan Today President Barack Obama called new national effort give American student opportunity learn computer science school short Computer Science All
As company Microsoft support president call action hope leader party use find common ground make opportunity reality nation student
As company made access computer science education top business public policy philanthropic priority
Our employee founded Technology Education Literacy Schools effort enlists tech employee teach computer science school state
It provided u view challenge benefit expanding computer science education
Over past three year used voice along many others encourage state change law recognize computer science course count towards high school distribution requirement
In addition founding member reached million American student Hour Code trained middle high school teacher
And recently announced additional million commitment Microsoft YouthSpark increase access computer science
All provided u opportunity learn firsthand
Here First economy creating remarkable pace job require understanding computer science
Increasingly job every part economy
It estimated economy add new job next decade require even skill sector ranging agriculture manufacturing traditional form information technology
But country problem
The skill gap leaving many job unfilled
Each year see number unfilled job growing
Some estimate could many million unfilled IT skilled job country end decade
There second problem
Other country moving ahead United States creating opportunity student learn coding computing science
As tech company work country worldwide witnessing every day
We seeing country large China United Kingdom small Estonia embrace cause take kind step needed make computer science widespread available student
While growing momentum many American state city United States yet moving pace needed
If one data point make clear There high school United States last year high school offered advanced placement course computer science
So yet reached even percent nation high school making type course available young Americans
As challenging general implication even significant future diversity country
Right leaving many part America behind
Only percent student took AP course computer science last year female
Only percent student color
We finding rural community poor urban area computer science offer much people future many school yet making class available
But also seeing class offered huge positive impact
Girls take AP computer science course high school ten time likely major computer science college
And Latino student take course high school seven time likely major field
That mean offer student younger age
What fascinating It clear parent country understand
A Gallup poll found percent American parent want child learn computer science
What opportunity create kind movement make goal reality
We clearly need tech sector continue
Microsoft one many company tech sector committed effort
In addition business initiative u involved philanthropy including group
But private sector philanthropy fill gap without public funding
And going accelerate progress nation need federal funding
That today proposal important
It provide accelerant help state school district progress quickly
Not since President Dwight Eisenhower responded Sputnik launch calling federal support math science country type opportunity exists today create economic educational foundation next generation American student
In bipartisan group lawmaker Congress passed National Defense Education Act providing first federal funding help state strengthen math science education across country
Their leadership created educational foundation sent country moon end next decade
Even important created skill base helped propel country towards three decade new technology job growth
The opportunity smaller
But requires comparable effort provide student across country opportunity learn skill future
This u working tech sector understood clearly last year
It hope country make year seize moment make vision real

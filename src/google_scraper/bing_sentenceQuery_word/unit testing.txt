In method individual unit set one computer program module together associated control data usage procedure operating procedure tested determine whether fit use
Intuitively one view unit smallest testable part application
In unit could entire module commonly individual function procedure
In unit often entire interface class could individual method
Unit test short code fragment created programmer occasionally development process
It form basis component testing
Ideally independent others
Substitutes used assist testing module isolation
Unit test typically written run ensure code meet design behaves intended
Because class may class testing class frequently spill testing another class
A common example class depend order test class tester often writes code interacts database
This mistake unit test usually go outside class boundary especially cross boundary introduce unacceptable performance problem unit
Crossing unit boundary turn unit test integration test test case fail may unclear component causing failure
Instead software developer create abstract interface around database query implement interface
By abstracting necessary attachment code temporarily reducing net effective coupling independent unit thoroughly tested may previously achieved
This result unit also maintainable
Unit testing commonly may still performed manually
The favor one
The objective unit testing isolate unit validate correctness
A manual approach unit testing may employ instructional document
However automation efficient achieving enables many benefit listed article
Conversely planned carefully careless manual unit test case may execute integration test case involves many software component thus preclude achievement goal established unit testing
To fully realize effect isolation using automated approach unit code body test executed within outside natural environment
In word executed outside product calling context originally created
Testing isolated manner reveals unnecessary dependency code tested unit data space product
These dependency eliminated
Using automation framework developer code criterion result known good test verify unit correctness
During test case execution framework test fail criterion
Many framework also automatically flag failed test case report summary
Depending upon severity failure framework may halt subsequent testing
As consequence unit testing traditionally motivator programmer create code body
This practice promotes healthy habit software development
unit testing refactoring often work together best solution may emerge
Parameterized unit test PUTs test take parameter
Unlike traditional unit test usually closed method PUTs take set parameter
PUTs supported various test framework
Suitable parameter unit test may supplied manually case automatically generated test framework
Testing tool like exist generate test input PUTs
The goal unit testing isolate part program show individual part correct
A unit test provides strict written piece code must satisfy
As result affords several benefit
Unit testing find problem early
This includes bug programmer implementation flaw missing part specification unit
The process writing thorough set test force author think input output error condition thus crisply define unit desired behavior
The cost finding bug coding begin code first written considerably lower cost detecting identifying correcting bug later bug may also cause problem software
Code impossible difficult test poorly written thus unit testing force developer structure function object better way
In TDD frequently used unit test created code written
When test pas code considered complete
The unit test run function frequently larger code base developed either code changed via automated process build
If unit test fail considered bug either changed code test
The unit test allow location fault failure easily traced
Since unit test alert development team problem handing code tester client still early development process
Unit testing allows programmer code upgrade system library later date make sure module still work correctly
The procedure write test case whenever change cause fault quickly identified
Unit test detect change may break
Unit testing may reduce uncertainty unit used testing style approach
By testing part program first testing sum part becomes much easier
Unit testing provides sort living documentation system
Developers looking learn functionality provided unit use look unit test gain basic understanding unit interface
Unit embody characteristic critical success unit
These characteristic indicate use unit well negative behavior trapped unit
A unit test case document critical characteristic although many software development environment rely solely upon code document product development
When software developed using approach combination writing unit test specify interface plus refactoring activity performed test passing may take place formal design
Each unit test seen design element specifying class method observable behaviour
Testing catch every error program evaluate every execution path trivial program
This superset
The true unit testing
Additionally unit testing definition test functionality unit
Therefore catch integration error broader error function performed across multiple unit test area
Unit testing done conjunction activity show presence absence particular error prove complete absence error
To guarantee correct behavior every execution path every possible input ensure absence error technique required namely application proving software component unexpected behavior
An elaborate hierarchy unit test equal integration testing
Integration peripheral unit included integration test unit test
Integration testing typically still relies heavily human testing difficult automate manual testing often appears faster cheaper
Software testing combinatorial problem
For example every Boolean decision statement requires least two test one outcome true one outcome false
As result every line code written programmer often need line test code
This obviously take time investment may worth effort
There also many problem easily tested example involve multiple
In addition code unit test likely least buggy code testing
quote Never go sea two chronometer take one three
Meaning two contradict know one correct
Another challenge related writing unit test difficulty setting realistic useful test
It necessary create relevant initial condition part application tested behaves like part complete system
If initial condition set correctly test exercising code realistic context diminishes value accuracy unit test result
To obtain intended benefit unit testing rigorous discipline needed throughout software development process
It essential keep careful record test performed also change made source code unit software
Use system essential
If later version unit fails particular test previously passed software provide list source code change applied unit since time
It also essential implement sustainable process ensuring test case failure reviewed regularly addressed immediately
If process implemented ingrained team workflow application evolve sync unit test suite increasing false positive reducing effectiveness test suite
Unit testing embedded system software present unique challenge Because software developed different platform one eventually run readily run test program actual deployment environment possible desktop program
Unit test tend easiest method input parameter output
It easy create unit test major function method interact something external application
For example method work database might require mock database interaction created probably wo comprehensive real database interaction
Here set test case specify number element implementation
First must interface called Adder implementing class constructor called AdderImpl
It go Adder interface method called add two integer parameter return another integer
It also specifies behaviour method small range value number test method
In case unit test written first act design document specifying form behaviour desired solution implementation detail left programmer
Following simplest thing could possibly work practice easiest solution make test pas shown
Using design specification one significant advantage design method The design document used verify implementation
The test never pas unless developer implement solution according design
Unit testing lack accessibility diagrammatic specification diagram may generated unit test using automated tool
Most modern language free tool usually available extension
Free tool like based framework outsource another system graphical rendering view human consumption
Unit testing cornerstone relies automated
This automated unit testing framework either third party created within development group
Extreme programming us creation unit test
The developer writes unit test expose either software requirement defect
This test fail either requirement implemented yet intentionally expose defect existing code
Then developer writes simplest code make test along test pas
Most code system unit tested necessarily path code
Extreme programming mandate test everything possibly break strategy traditional test every execution path method
This lead developer develop fewer test classical method really problem restatement fact classical method rarely ever followed methodically enough execution path thoroughly tested
Extreme programming simply recognizes testing rarely exhaustive often expensive economically viable provides guidance effectively focus limited resource
Crucially test code considered first class project artifact maintained quality implementation code duplication removed
Developers release unit testing code code repository conjunction code test
Extreme programming thorough unit testing allows benefit mentioned simpler confident code development simplified code integration accurate documentation modular design
These unit test also constantly run form
Unit testing also critical concept
As emergent design heavily dependent upon refactoring unit test integral component
Unit testing framework often product distributed part compiler suite
They help simplify process unit testing developed
Examples testing framework include open source solution various testing framework known collectively solution Development Testing dotTEST Testwell
It generally possible perform unit testing without support specific framework writing client code exercise unit test us mechanism signal failure
Unit testing without framework valuable adoption unit testing scant unit test hardly better none whereas framework place adding unit test becomes relatively easy
In framework many advanced unit test feature missing must
Some programming language directly support unit testing
Their grammar allows direct declaration unit test without importing library whether third party standard
Additionally boolean condition unit test expressed syntax boolean expression used test code used statement
Languages unit testing support include Some language without support good unit testing
Those language include

What Mocking
Prologue If look noun dictionary find one definition word
Mocking primarily used unit testing
An object test may dependency complex object
To isolate behaviour object want test replace object mock simulate behavior real object
This useful real object impractical incorporate unit test
In short mocking creating object simulate behaviour real object
At time may want distinguish opposed
There may disagreement subject definition stub minimal simulated object
The stub implement enough behaviour allow object test execute test
A mock like stub test also verify object test call mock expected
Part test verifying mock used correctly
To give example You stub database implementing simple structure storing record
The object test read write record database stub allow execute test
This could test behaviour object related database database stub would included let test run
If instead want verify object test writes specific data database mock database
Your test would incorporate assertion written database mock
There plenty answer SO good post web mocking
One place might want start looking post Martin Fowler discus lot idea mocking
In one paragraph Mocking one particlar technique allow testing unit code reliant upon dependency
In general differentiates mocking method mock object used replace code dependency allow expectation set mock object know meant called code respond
Your original question mentioned TypeMock I left answer TypeMock name
It offer feature free mocking framework like RhinoMocks Moq plus powerful option
Whether need TypeMock highly debatable mocking would ever want free mocking library many argue ability offered TypeMock often lead away well encapsulated design
As another answer stated actually defined concept could taken mean type mocking TypeMock offer using CLR profiler intercept call runtime giving much greater ability fake object requirement needing interface virtual method
Other answer explain mocking
Let walk
And believe actually far simpler think
It subclass original class
It data injected avoid testing injected part solely testing rest code
Let say writing iOS application network job test application
To whether network call work expected NOT YOUR DUTY
It another party duty test
You must remove network dependency yet continue test code work
A network call return different status code etc JSON response
Your app suppose work case error app throw expected error
What mocking create real network response like code JSON file test code without real network call waiting network response
You manually network response ALL different kind see app working expect
incorrect data responsibility responsibility test app correct case test app throw right error This creating real known mocking
In order CA use original code original code response right
You MUST add something dummy data normally needed part class
So SUBCLASS original class add whatever network HTTPResponse data OR case failure pas correct errorString HTTPResponse need subclass ie class
Long story short mocking testing also make feed class depends
In example instead whether app work expect class A good example mocking Just skip minute
I really like part transcript Because testing want make sure function called
We need make sure called Mock simulates behavior real controlled way
Mock object used unit testing
Often method test call external service method within
These called dependency
Once mocked dependency behave way defined
With dependency controlled mock easily test behavior method coded
This Unit testing
The purpose mocking type sever dependency order isolate test specific unit
Stubs simple surrogate mock surrogate verify usage
A mocking framework tool help generate stub mock
Since original wording mention type mocking I got impression related TypeMock
In experience general term mocking
Please feel free disregard info specifically TypeMock
TypeMock Isolator differs mocking framework work modifying IL fly
That allows mock type instance framework mock
To mock framework must provide abstraction mock
TypeMock offer great flexibility expense clean runtime environment
As side effect way TypeMock achieves result sometimes get strange result using TypeMock
I would think use TypeMock isolator mocking framework would TypeMocking
It tool generates mock use unit test without need write code IoC mind
If mock involves network request another alternative real test server hit
You use service generate request response testing
Mocking generating simulate real object behaviour test Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Also Google I read question unit testing I exactly know WHAT
I hoping someone tell following Thanks lot help
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
Unit testing involves breaking program piece subjecting piece series test
Usually test run separate program method testing varies depending language type software GUI library
Most language look one
Tests usually run periodically often every change source code
The often better sooner catch problem
Unit testing simply verifies individual unit code mostly function work expected
Usually write test case automatically generated
The output test simple console output GUI different framework
Performing unit test designed simple generally test written form function determine whether returned value equal value expecting wrote function value write called write test first
Imagine simple function would like test The unit test code would look something like When run test informed test passed
Now built run test know particular function unit perform expect
Now imagine another developer come along change function performance reason When developer run test created simple function see first fails know build broken
They done often possible
When performing test part development process code automatically going designed better wrote function moved
Also concept going evolve naturally code
The obvious benefit knowing road change made individual unit code affected pas test
A methodology automaticaly testing code battery test designed enforce desired outcome manage change
A unit sense smallest atomic component code make sense test typically method class example
Part process building stub object mock allow work unit independant object
Almost always process built IDE extension executes test every compile
A number framework exist assisting creation unit test indeed mock objcts often named Unit cf
jUnit xUnit nUnit
These framework provide formalised way create test
As process test driven development TDD often motivation unit testing unit testing require TDD supposes test part spec definition therefore requires written first code written solve test
always
Very small throwaway project may worth quite sure really throwaway
In theory every object orientated program unit testable design pattrns make difficult
Notoriously singleton pattern problematic conversely dependancy injection framework much unit testing oriented
I find easiest way illustrate look code
This getting started page NUnit site good introduction Is everything testable
Generally calculates something yes
UI code whole problem deal though simulating user clicking button tricky
What test
I tend write test around thing I know going tricky
Complicated state transition business critical calculation sort thing
Generally I worried testing basic stuff although purist doubtless say I wrong front tested
Like many thing right answer
What unittesting
It tricky define
On technical level build function call function codebase validate result
Basically get bunch thing like assert complicated DataLayer MockDatabase Dilbert
On add automated check everything still work like assumed thing worked
This helpful refactor implement complicated algorithm
The result generally bunch documentation lot le bug behaviour code pinned
I build test case edge case run similar working generational garbage collector
While I implement class I run test case involve class
Once I done working class I run unittests order see everything still work
You test much possible long test code easy enough stay untested
Given everything testable sane way
Think User interface
Think driver space shuttle nuclear bomb least pure
However lot lot code testable
Datastructures
Algorithms
Most
So test
HTH
tetha What exactly IS unit testing
Is built code run separate program
Or something else
The primary goal unit testing take smallest piece testable software application isolate remainder code determine whether behaves exactly expect
Essentially writing small bit code test individual bit code
In world would run small bit code using something like NUnit MBunit even built testing tool visual studio
In Java might use JUnit
Essentially test runner build project load execute unit test let know pas fail
How
Well easier said done unit test
It take quite bit practice get good
You need structure code way make easy unit test make test effective
When done
Are time project
Is everything
You make sense
Not everything suited unit testing
For example UI code hard unit test often get little benefit
Business Layer code however often suitable test unit testing focused
Unit testing massive topic fully get understanding best benefit I recommend getting hold book unit testing give good grasp concept apply code
On How part I think introduction good job illustrating different style unit test
On When part Unit testing testing
By unit testing also force design software something unit testable
Many people opinion design part Good Design TM regardless benefit testing
So one reason unit test force design something hopefully easier maintain would designed unit testing

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I understand advantage development unit testing introductory class computer science student learning
I aware researcher saying YES taught real world anyone using class
Do student write test provided assignment
I going start answer way say depends context course head different direction
The fact calling course implies start chain tree course
A traditional theoretical CS course study different newer style program different zero boot camp
A traditional curriculum likely wo involve unit testing focus theory algorithm le practical coding
The newer one involve component learning good practice programming general usually specific language well coverage unit testing often appropriate
Even remain group people convinced wonder developer adhering Development TDD concept developer least familiar important make student aware point
For example UC Berkeley Engineering Software Service course cover unit testing quite heavily
I assume mean first programming course us language Java well integrated testing tool
If use unit testing I guess proper answer
There thing student could
However willing able modify teaching bit unit testing big win
I used teaching introductory programming adult year since back Extreme Programming young
I two thing
First I give assignment differently beginning
Rather giving student narrative describe programming exercise project must first decompose description task I give task list
In Agile Programming language I give small product backlog deck
The task numbered logical first order backlog completed project done
Therefore I using bit unit testing
Other personal agile programming practice employed including pair programming
I also act student Customer answering question needed
The second thing I On first day class I demo project public
I start small number story task decompose simple project
I pick student volunteer pair program laptop connected projector watch
I start driver control keyboard student navigator
He may know nothing programming little
We look first story discus bit get picture
I fire Eclipse start new project add JUnit project write test one card
It fails course
So nav I write app code make test pas
Repeat
At point switch role student becomes driver I act helpful navigator
If class large also open navigation comment question class whole get used process aiding driver
Along way I discus step go meta
This take much period enough time distribute code done class
They pair work next story wander giving help
So see unit testing pair programming build philosophy integrated way
Another thing work well assign project give unit test suite along product backlog
In word write unit test make pas
The side however test contain identifier app class method name example
In big picture test suite design space decide thing
If write test increment method normally even stub method
In writing test discover name well args return type
If give test initially already done step need teach bit later
Maybe exercise
That depends entirely context course
Are teaching unit testing suite student
If learned something use
If unittest part curriculum definitely student use
At University student formally introduced suite year thus project required testing suite
As project require unittesting already enough hair pulling
So answer question using unit testing formally taught yet
It depends mean used
The student project might lend TDD early assignment probably small end writing project test stuff could deflating
That said least familiar TDD mean
The important thing get across early testing TDD particular importance thorough testing
I never big TDD person mean I Do test code constantly throughout development important concept
What might good idea expose TDD give assigment give test test framework
I played little last year plan next year
When giving lab homework give test kindof like use online grader get see grader
Later time project permit add test perhaps even TDD thing whole hog
By posting answer agree

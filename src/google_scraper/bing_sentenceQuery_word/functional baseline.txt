In baseline agreed description attribute product point time serf basis defining change
A change movement baseline next state
The identification significant change baseline state central purpose identification
Typically significant state receive formal approval status either explicitly implicitly
An approval status may marked individually prior definition status established project leader signified association position established baseline
Nevertheless approval status usually recognized publicly
Thus baseline may also mark approved configuration item
signed execution
In similar manner associating multiple configuration item baseline indicates item approved
Generally baseline may single work product set work product used logical basis comparison
A baseline may also established basis subsequent select activity work product meet certain criterion
Such activity may attributed formal approval
Conversely configuration project often includes one baseline status configuration metric collected
The current configuration refers current status current audit current metric
Similarly le frequently baseline may refer item associated specific project
This may include revision item latest revision item project depending upon context
A baseline may specific type baseline body item particular certifying
Some example include While marking approval status cover majority us baseline baseline may also established signify progress work passage time
In case baseline visible measure endured collective effort
developmental baseline
Baselines may also mark
Baselines valued use identify notable state work product also provide historical view work product element proceeded together time
When historical baseline retrieved state work product subset share significance history change allows project leader compare relative progress single part project project whole allows project leader identify individual item lag lead progress toward better functionality performance
For reason baseline identification monitoring retrieval critical success configuration management
Once retrieved baseline may compared particular configuration another baseline
Most baseline established fixed point time serve continue reference point identification state
However baseline established carry forward reference item regardless change item
These latter baseline evolve progression work effort continue identify notable work product project
In process performing configuration management configuration item work product may assigned baseline establish certain status
In sense baseline work product may require certain change work product ensure conforms characteristic associated baseline referenced
This varies upon context many case requires work product reset initial possibly inherently approved state work may proceed
In many environment baseline controlled certain subsequent activity work product baseline either prohibited permitted
These activity selected controlled depending upon configuration management system also monitored
Consequently baseline ordinarily subjected configuration management audit
may include examination specific action performed baseline identification individual involved action evaluation change within baseline certification approval accounting metric collection comparison another baseline
Though common software system label existence baseline found several domain
Baselines found modeling system business rule management system among others
In addition field hardware software engineering baseline found medicine

In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

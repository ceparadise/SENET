Spike indicator used Agile software build theoretical feature included software
A user spike story determined according user state basic development project phase geared toward user software requirement
Spikes help avoid expanding document increase administrative overhead
A user spike allows developing team react quickly user requirement goal
A user spike typically written human language form informal statement
These statement transformed algorithm require user acceptance turned working program code
To transform user spike code developer must ask series question used indicate constraint must considered development phase
If code lack user requirement complete procedural rewrite may result

What Spike
Who create
And look like VersionOne
Or Agile Central Pivotal Tracker HP AGM Jira ALM tool
Excellent question
I thought I share thought topic Sometimes story large overly complex
Perhaps implementation party tool library poorly understood
The team estimate story
Perhaps unsure able complete story due potential blocker
In case might want build functional technical experiment figure
We might want look something day
We might want look alternative
Do googling
Do experiment library software package
Consider alternative refactoring path
These spike
You call research spike architectural spike refactoring spike wish
A spike investment Product Owner make figure need built team going build advance actually building
The Product Owner allocates little bit team capacity ahead story need delivered story come sprint team know
Therefore spike investment make story estimable
Here deal spike
Spikes represent uncertainty
If backlog full spike mean backlog full stuff know
If backlog full stuff know product delivery process going stable
It mean business making commitment release level credible plan getting done
Therefore generally want spike hang around long
I usually try soon I discover need
I usually stick next sprint I add sprint
If spike take say hour two maybe need track ALM tool
If larger enter backlog
How would BA Product Owner write spike
The cocky answer say make tech lead enter
A serious answer would technical story format would good In order split collection curve wizard story tech lead need detailed design
Just enough split story
In order estimate user connection report story tech lead BA need research capability MSTR conversation PO
Just enough estimate story
I like start name title SPIKE make stand ALM tool
Using tag label could work well
Teams agree every spike say never day research
For team might say day common situation
At end report finding
That might result another spike experiment
If able answer question time run must still report result team decide next
What next might define another spike
You might say I think bug app way I hear back support within The timebox effort calendar time
So spike recreating problem providing enough info support group look
It also best spike one clear question answer
Not bunch question ambiguous statement stuff need look
Therefore split spike would large user story
You use whole
For example estimate enough work give estimate stop
By way I another blog post
There answer spike
More ever wanted know spike
There rule engagement need considered Product Last post explored idea team elemental building block Should estimate spike
What spike

Today I installed new CPU cooler onto desktop actively monitor CPU temp adjust fan speed needed
It also alters LED cooler based temp CPU
I noticed new cooler I lock system let screen timeout turn CPU usage spike stay spiked I activate system touching mouse hitting key turn monitor back
At point stop spiking normal
Looking around solution people similar issue resulted ASRock motherboard application issue I however Gigabyte board special software installed
My system changed cooler case since last time turned something apparently going prior new cooler making aware
I sure would causing
I tried monitoring process system go state lock screen monitor
For example screenshot showing CPU usage small screen timed til I rewoke seems culprit
At highest peak CPU usage ProcMon say Profiling operating
Basically every event seems listed Profiling screen yet CPU hitting consistently soon screen turn
Does anyone know would happening stop
I want system trucking along use I want turn usage program I want running background messaging related thing case I got something important
Edit Using Process Explorer I confirmed definitely hitting CPU holding screen turned
I disabled Time Protection seem help prevent happening
Is way stop behaviour without completely disabling Windows Defender
This idle maintenance task kick Windows idle
To disable run Task Scheduler go Task Scheduler Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler Here right click select option
In Windows task called Microsoft Windows MemoryDiagnostic RunFullMemoryDiagnostic
The computer idling launch application service maintenance defragment optimize drive check malware done Windows Defender exact
I see issue

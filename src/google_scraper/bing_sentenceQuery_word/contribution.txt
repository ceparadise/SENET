This page regular update forum find better venue
The discussion begin Trudi article reproduced entirety link original source continues recent contribution I received others topic reproduced permission
Please join discussion After brief review comment I ask permission reproduce Web page
I read introductory President Page Ms Trudi Hahn ASIST Bulletin concerning question Information Science Contributed World
I agree add earlier tool information science applied taming first wave information explosion phenomenon automatic indexing abstracting KWIC KWOC indexing text analysis natural language search system led contributed development indexing search engine Internet Web
Still need research development order prevent coming information society generation devastation digital tsunami well loss global digital memory
Moreover term like document web page home page bookmark database program library ebook ejournal hyperlink applied also reference inspiration earlier information scientist developed dealt
To extent need document role information science building current Information Society
Let discus Trudi Bellardo Hahn statement contribitions Information Science IS seminal discovery century written ecumenical possible
Still always exclusionary delimitation one professional society ASIS T much informaiton science lay outside purview defined largely practitioner library science qua information science many contributers would see information scientist lexicographer linguist historian pioneering methodology especially quantitifaction specializing imagery whole coterie information scientist within discipline
Consider example journal review published Institut de Recherche et de Textes Paris
Its vol
focused special theme Diplomatics computing ie
form analysis communication documentation never considered Information Science Information Scientists ASIS T
Vol
treat cognitive aspect medieval documentation point information science origin far flung modernist notion presentist mentality
Or consider explosion work archival science seldom integrated Information Science go unfortunately without IS would benefit
Much work lie outside invisible parameter ASIS T forum Computers History largely European circle archival science humanity computing contribution series Data Bases Social Sciences Humanities genuinely pioneering work reported ASIS T inner circle humanist social scientist working within individual discipline
The cross IS per se negligible
In last book dedicated Eric Boehm information scientist entrepreneur included ASIS T great early pioneering automated indexing bibliographic control literature History founding Institute Information Management I attempted provide synthesis interplay History Information Science hybrid called Historical Information Science since advent personal computing
Its citation bibliography may beof interest interested history information science
And issue History becoming history onslaught digital medium rampant interpolation everywhere resulting destablization know anything documentation one turn recent discussion Vol
Issue forum Roy Rozenzweig outside pale IS defined ASIS T
The question Trudi Hahn posed ASIS T identify important accomplishment past century establish professional history historical tradition great deed ignoring failed aspiration fractured professional association disunified research agenda
In sense Trudi Bellardo Hahn answer may appropriate attempt synthesis intriquing IS still without history well documented elaborated historical analysis secondary literature remains virtually beyond pale professional History
Is wonder IS bothered much History
In vein important remember critical question IS contributed past ASIS T information scientist still world coming year future generation history

Some note made reading chronology follow
Growing specialisation since century
Early association chemistry
Early century development review article annual review
Early interest nomenclature
Message transmission system preceded analytical system full public development
Discontinuity Avagadro
Technologies giving greater control complexity recurrent concern nomenclature
I would add item go beyond number formulating national policy related issue privacy security One describes productivity information
Fritz Machlup summarized R D thus come refer ultimate output increment input economy area new knowledge direct output R D applied
He continued R D expenditure investment incremental output economy attributable application R D finding return
In word saving come improved output rather reduced input
Another observation human being lack capacity cope rising tide discovery
William Garvey described scientist problem concisely Even perfect retrieval system would presented many item could assimilate process
The recommendation President Science Advisory Committee responded
The technical community must recognize handling technical information worthy integral part science We shall cope information explosion long run scientist prepared commit deeply job sifting reviewing synthesizing information handling information sophistication meaning merely mechanically
Such scientist must create new science shuffle document activity reviewing writing book criticizing synthesizing much part science traditional research
It also said The idea data substance science technology embodied literature literature remains unity science unified viable
Yet tremendous growth literature danger science fragmenting mass repetitious finding worse conflicting specialty recognized mutually inconsistent
This essence crisis scientific technical information
I feel worth repeating science policy establishment turned away information science soon United States landed man Moon
The mandate Science Policy Act include expert dissemination panel advising President matter science technology instantly abandoned
The National Science Foundation ended interest research science communication
In spite library recognized research overhead Office Management Budget Circular science agency university treat library role preparation research proposal authorship peer review
Nonetheless pair important seminal discovery book anyone ever care

Learn different type network concept architecture

The definition computer science differ depending answering question
I studied computer science year think getting closer understanding
Here thing computer science get confused regular science example chemistry biology astronomy
In science look specific item study learn example chemistry study natural element biology study organ astronomy look star
But none science try change something else besides already
In computer science different reason deal called artificial artifact fancy way saying deal man created idea right man created idea
What idea
well short simple think people communicate use symbol letter express certain idea thing computer need symbol simplest symbol number abstract one include letter
Those idea expressed need create something Latin root English word calculating figuring
Thus according etymology computation refers idea act calculating
The programmer modern world computer science idea hit floor
To exact taking mathematical concept putting test see idea really expect programmer come play
The programmer shear creator artificial artifact one dictate perceives world system act
That great computer science
That thing question one difficult answer example ask laptop computer
More likely answer well screen keyboard etc
All item follow law physical world answer could right one answer start breaking complexity machine actually example playing game opening web browser chatting friend online watching Eli computer guy etc
None thing hold physical world say look grab Firefox
What mean computer science deal artificial
The true answer study learn computer science grow help refine field computer science maybe one day definition computer science
Now fun part better idea computer science
Look definition people try give computer scientist disgusted definition
Rick H Responsible evaluating business request determine feasibility identifying option recommending solution software development enhancement
Assist interpreting customer requirement conceptual design specification
Developing solution conducting analysis system recommending solution based upon finding
I Masters degree computer science
In likely undergraduate degree CS programming
But graduate level get root CS
To best described applied mathematics people get caught programming side
Programming certainly tool computer scientist pocket certainly one
If someone programmer I consider computer scientist
Rather practicing computer scientist would contributing world computer science whole
By example designing new new way computing quantum bio etc inventing new programming language etc
Someone push boundary
I consider practicing computer scientist
I work network security engineer
But humble opinion compute science
Depends school one attends first year undergraduate focused towards programming second year topic covered discrete mathematics algorithm design cryptography semester compiler
As far declaring computer scientist would say anyone shape form putting artificial artifact computer scientist mind
Will change
likely education continues

Dump
This one word I heard among hardcore programmer hacker yet I never knew mean
I found almost everywhere center around software digital hardware
They say something like dumping file dump CPU dump memory
What feat usually performed
A data taken storage medium
unedited
For example content recorded state core specified time
In Unix software backup file system
In essence dump content taken storage medium contains state medium used mostly debugging purpose
In programming dump something mean get content
For example one say mean query content memory given address store somewhere analysis result called
In computing core dump properly memory dump storage dump consists recorded state working memory computer program specific time generally program terminated abnormally crashed
The name come day magnetic core memory used introduction semiconductor memory name remained established system inspired UNIX long technology faded use
In practice key piece
In large meaning represents state running program process medium storage

A memory dump process content memory displayed stored case application system crash
Memory dump help software developer system administrator diagnose identify resolve problem led application system failure
Memory dump also known core dump blue screen death BSOD computer
Memory dump primarily identifies problem error within operating system installed application within system
Typically memory dump provides information last state program application system terminated crashed
This information consists memory location program counter program state related detail
It displayed also creates system log file later
After memory dump computer generally unavailable inaccessible rebooted
Memory dump also caused memory leak system memory longer continue operation

Core dump often used assist diagnosing error computer program
The name come principal form
The name remained long magnetic core technology became obsolete
On many operating system program automatically trigger core dump extension phrase dump core come mean many case fatal error regardless whether record program memory result
The term core dump memory dump dump also become jargon indicate storing large amount raw data examination purpose
Earliest core dump paper printout content memory typically arranged column number sometimes accompanied interpretation machine language instruction text string decimal number
As memory size increased analysis utility developed dump written magnetic medium like tape disk
Instead displaying content applicable memory modern operating system typically generate file containing image memory belonging crashed process memory image part related process along information value processor register program counter system flag information useful determining root cause crash
These file viewed text printed analysed specialised tool elfdump system Microsoft Windows Valgrind debugger
Modern core dump file error message typically use hexadecimal encoding decimal octal representation le convenient programmer
Core dump serve useful debugging aid several situation
On early standalone system core dump allowed user debug program without monopolizing expensive computing facility debugging printout could also convenient debugging using switch light
On shared computer whether batch processing server system core dump allow debugging system go back operation immediately
Core dump allow user save crash later analysis comparison crash
For may impractical support debugging computer analysis dump may take place different computer
Some operating system early version support attaching running process core dump necessary run debugger process memory content
Core dump used capture data freed may thus used retrieve information program longer running
In absence interactive debugger core dump may used assiduous programmer determine error direct examination
A core dump represents complete content dumped region address space dumped process
Depending operating system dump may contain data structure aid interpretation memory region
In system successful interpretation requires program user trying interpret dump understands structure program memory use
A debugger use one exists help programmer interpret dump identifying variable symbolically displaying source code symbol table available le interpretation dump possible might still enough possible determine cause problem
There also tool called analyze dump
One popular tool available many operating system GNU binutils
On modern operating system administrator programmer read core dump file using GNU Binutils BFD gdb objdump use library
This library supply raw data given address memory region core dump know anything variable data structure memory region application using library read core dump determine address variable determine layout data structure example using symbol table program undergoing debugging
Analysts crash dump system use Linux Kernel Crash Dump LKCD
Core dump save context state process given state returning later
Systems made highly available transferring core processor sometimes via core dump file
Core also dumped onto remote host network security risk
In older simpler operating system process contiguous core dump file simply binary file sequence byte word
In modern operating system process address space may gap share page process file elaborate representation used may also include information state program time dump
In system core dump generally use standard support two memory dump format described
There three type dump To analyze Windows dump used
memory dump also known memory dump single process
It contains selected data record full partial filtered process memory list state information kernel object list loaded unloaded
Full list option available enum
The probably first craft routinely utilize core dump feature Deep Space segment
The core dump feature mandatory telemetry feature Deep Space segment proven minimize system diagnostic cost

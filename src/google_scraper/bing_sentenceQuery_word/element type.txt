In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

learn share knowledge build career
I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

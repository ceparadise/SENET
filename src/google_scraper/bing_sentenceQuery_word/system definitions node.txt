A node point within network
In environment device accessible network device considered node
The concept node work several level view defines node major center Internet traffic typically routed
This usage somewhat confusing Internet node also referred Internet hub
The idea node popularized adoption theory concept distributed network
In context node gateway could receive store send information along different route distributed network
Each node given equal standing within network meaning loss one node significantly hurt network
When applied office personal network however node simply one device performs particular function
As loss node usually mean loss function inability use printer

Computer cluster may configured different purpose ranging general purpose business need support scientific calculation
In either case cluster may use approach
Note attribute described exclusive computer cluster may also use approach
cluster configuration share computational workload provide better overall performance
For example web server cluster may assign different query different node overall response time optimized
However approach may significantly differ among application

Computer cluster may configured different purpose ranging general purpose business need support scientific calculation
In either case cluster may use approach
Note attribute described exclusive computer cluster may also use approach
cluster configuration share computational workload provide better overall performance
For example web server cluster may assign different query different node overall response time optimized
However approach may significantly differ among application
cluster used scientific computation would balance load different algorithm cluster may use simple assigning new request different node
Computer cluster used purpose rather handling operation web service database

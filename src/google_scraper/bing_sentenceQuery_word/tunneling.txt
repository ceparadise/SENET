Tunneling protocol allows secure movement data one network another
Tunneling involves allowing private network communication sent across public network Internet process called encapsulation
The encapsulation process allows data packet appear though public nature public network actually private data packet allowing pas unnoticed
Tunneling also known port forwarding
In tunneling data broken smaller piece called packet move along tunnel transport
As packet move tunnel encrypted another process called encapsulation occurs
The private network data protocol information go encapsulated public network transmission unit sending
The unit look like public data allowing transmitted across Internet
Encapsulation allows packet arrive proper destination
At final destination decryption occur
There various protocol allow tunneling occur including Tunneling way communication conducted private network tunneled public network
This particularly useful corporate setting also offer security feature encryption option

In used refer one two related distinct notion sometimes combination thereof Some programming language researcher academic use first meaning alone combination second distinguishing feature programming language provide view encapsulation feature language object orientation
The second definition motivated fact many OOP language hiding component automatic overridden thus defined separate notion prefer second definition
The feature encapsulation supported using class programming language although alternative also exist
Encapsulation OOP
It refers bundling data method operate data
Encapsulation preventing unauthorized party direct access
Publicly accessible method generally provided class access value client class call method retrieve modify value within object
This mechanism unique programming
Implementations
offer similar form encapsulation
This similarity stem fact notion rely mathematical fundamental
Under definition encapsulation mean internal representation generally hidden view outside object definition
Typically object method directly inspect manipulate field
Some language like allow access via object method others
offer programmer degree control hidden typically via keywords like
It noted ISO standard refers hide information
Information hiding accomplished furnishing compiled version source code interfaced via header file
Hiding internals object protects integrity preventing user setting internal data component invalid inconsistent state
A supposed benefit encapsulation reduce system complexity thus increase allowing developer limit software component
Almost always way override protection usually via API Ruby Java C etc
sometimes mechanism like special keyword usage like
Below example show access data field restricted use keyword Below example Java Below example PHP Encapsulation also possible language
In C example structure declared public API header file set function operate item data containing data member accessible client API Clients call API function allocate operate deallocate object
The content type known accessible implementation API function client directly access content
The source code function defines actual content structure The author Design Patterns discus tension inheritance encapsulation length state experience designer overuse inheritance
The danger stated follows Because inheritance expose subclass detail parent implementation often said inheritance break encapsulation

By Oct Laboratory Computer Science Research Rutgers University Modified Oct These instruction show Tunnel X Windows traffic via WinSSH
Tunelling connection via SSH allows bypass Rutgers firewall block REXEC command also get encrypted connection computer host server connecting
Microsoft Windows connection X Window Server software part Cygwin Freeware Exceed
WinSSH Freeware
Download WinSSH clicking browser
A window open list file
Drag folder

Install WinSSH window machine double clicking file folder

Run X Window Server program

Run WinSSH

An SSH window like Figure open
Figure

Click menu select
A Settings window open similar Figure
Click setting window look like Figure
Make sure check box called Click button done
Figure
button default WinSSH window window like Figure open
Enter host trying connect
Click button done
Figure

If first time connecting via SSH remote host window similar shown Figure open option save host key
Click button
If first time connecting remote host immediately get login window
Figure
Figure
window shown Figure open asking password
Enter password click button
Figure

Assuming entered correct pair see system prompt SSH Window case
At time SSH tunnel X Windows session already established
To verify type printenv DISPLAY prompt
You get back
Example printenv DISPLAY If get answer check make sure step correctly remembered run Xwindow Server software first
Step

To run XWindows client program type would regularly
For example would like run xterm type You notice Xterm window open separate window using previously idle X Window server manager
This concludes step needed Tunnel X Windows Sessions WinSSH

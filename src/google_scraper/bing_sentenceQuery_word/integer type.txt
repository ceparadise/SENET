In computer science represents
Integral data type may different size may may allowed contain negative value
Integers commonly represented computer group binary digit bit
The size grouping varies set integer size available varies different type computer
Computer hardware including nearly always provide way represent processor memory address integer
The item integral type mathematical integer corresponds
Integral type may capable representing integer capable representing negative integer well
An integer value typically specified program sequence digit optionally prefixed
Some programming language allow notation hexadecimal base octal base
Some programming language also permit
The datum way value stored computer memory
Unlike mathematical integer typical datum computer minimal maximum possible value
The common representation positive integer string using
The order memory storing bit varies see
The integral type number bit representation
An integral type bit encode number example unsigned type typically represents value
Other encoding integer value bit pattern sometimes used example printed character code
There four binary computing system
The common allows signed integral type bit represent number
Two complement arithmetic convenient perfect representation value particular separate need distinguish signed unsigned type
Other possibility include
Some computer language define integer size way others varying definition depending underlying processor word size
Not language implementation define variable integer size defined size may even distinct particular implementation
An integer one may different size different language different processor
address Different support different integral data type
Typically hardware support signed unsigned type small fixed set width
The table list integral type width supported hardware common processor
High level programming language provide possibility
It common width integral type twice many bit biggest type
Many language also type specified number bit usually constrained le maximum width type represent integer specified range
Some language support integer also known
Other language support concept construct may library available represent large number using array smaller variable Java class package
These use much computer memory necessary store number however computer finite amount storage represent finite subset mathematical integer
These scheme support large number example one kilobyte memory could used store number decimal digit long
A type type represent two value usually identified respectively
This type stored memory using single bit often given full byte convenience addressing speed access
A quantity known eating smaller pun form word
One nibble corresponds one digit hold one digit sign code decimal
The term initially meant smallest addressable unit memory
In past byte used
There also computer could address individual bit machine could address quantity machine
The term usually used connection machine
The term always refers quantity
It mostly used field computer different byte width might communicate
In modern usage almost invariably mean eight bit since size fallen disuse thus come synonymous
The term used small group bit handled simultaneously processor particular
The size word thus
Many different word size used including
Since architectural size usually set first CPU family rather characteristic later compatible CPU
The meaning term derived also vary CPU OS
Practically new desktop processor capable using word though word size still common
The common early day computer
One important cause software incorrect assumption computer word size computer used programmer
For example programmer using C language incorrectly declares variable used store value greater program fail computer integer
That variable declared least bit computer
Programmers may also incorrectly assume pointer converted integer without loss information may work computer fail computer pointer integer
A represent whole number may take le storage smaller range compared standard integer machine
In denoted
It required least bit often smaller standard integer required
A conforming program assume safely store value may assume range larger
In integer
In datatype defined signed integer machine
A represent whole whose greater equal standard integer machine
In denoted
It required least bit may may larger standard integer
A conforming program assume safely store value may assume range larger
term equivalent In version version type supported double minimum capacity standard
This type supported compiler require C code compliant previous standard type exist
For compliant compiler minimum requirement specified range signed unsigned must fulfilled however extending range permitted
This issue exchanging code data platform direct hardware access
Thus several set header providing platform independent exact width type
The C provides introduced

In simply classification data tell programmer intends use data
Most programming language support various type data example
A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory
The type system us data type information check access manipulate data
Most data type statistic comparable type computer programming vice versa shown following table identified five definition type literature
Types including behavior align closely model whereas model would tend include code called
The five type The definition term representation often done imperative language definition term value space behaviour used language
typically type basic language implementation
All data computer based digital electronics represented alternative lowest level
The smallest addressable unit data usually group bit called usually bit
The unit processed instruction called typically bit
Most instruction interpret word word represent unsigned integer value signed integer value
Because machine language machine need distinguish unsigned signed data type part
There specific set arithmetic instruction use different interpretation bit word number
Machine data type need made available allowing control hardware
The instance supply integer type various width
If corresponding native type exist target platform compiler break code using type exist
For instance integer requested bit platform compiler tacitly treat array two bit integer
Several language allow convenient manipulation machine data
In higher level programming machine data type often hidden implementation detail would render code le portable exposed
For instance generic type might supplied instead integer specific
The represents value
Although two value possible rarely implemented single binary digit efficiency reason
Many programming language explicit Boolean type instead interpreting instance false value true
Boolean data simply refers logical structure language interpreted machine language
In case Boolean refers logic False
True always non zero especially one known Boolean
Such derived one primitive type
This done number way
The way combined called
Composing primitive type compound type generally result new type
different type
Many others possible tend variation compound
The distinct value compared assigned necessarily particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four suit deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Some implementation allow programmer assign integer value enumeration value even treat integer
Such Character string type store sequence character character set
Since character set include possible numeric string
However many language treat belonging different type numeric value
Character string type different subtypes according required character width
The original wide ASCII found limited superseded set encode wide variety alphabet symbol
Strings may either fixed size even programming language
They may also subtyped maximum size
Note string primitive language instance C may composed array character
Types based derived basic type explained
In language C type derived type
The main derived type data type whose value refers directly point another value stored elsewhere using
It primitive kind
In everyday term page number book could considered piece data refers another one
Pointers often stored format similar integer however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To ameliorate potential problem pointer considered separate type type data point even underlying representation
Any type specify implementation
For instance abstract type implemented array contiguous block memory containing multiple value set memory block linked
Abstract type handled code know care underlying type contained
Programming agnostic concrete data type called
Arrays record also contain underlying type considered concrete specify content element laid memory
Examples include For convenience language may supply real world data type instance even language allows built primitive type
A associate type computed value
By examining flow value type system attempt prove occur
The type system question determines constitutes type error type system generally seek guarantee operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense
A may use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler data type example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Type system may variously forth

An integer whole number fraction positive negative zero
Therefore number integer
Unlike integer decimal place
Integers commonly used data type computer programming
For example whenever number incremented within loop loop integer used
Integers also used determine item location within array
When two integer added subtracted multiplied result also integer
However one integer divided another result may integer fraction
For example divided equal integer divided equal contains fraction
Decimal number may either rounded produce integer result

The double fundamental data type built compiler used define numeric holding number decimal point
C many programming language recognize double type
A double type represent fractional well whole value
It contain digit including decimal point
The float type smaller range used one time faster double dealing thousand million number
Because calculation speed increased dramatically new processor however advantage float double negligible
Many programmer consider double type default working number require decimal point
Other data type include
The double float type similar differ precision range The also deal data serf different purpose
Numbers without fractional part need decimal point used
Thus int type hold whole number take le space arithmetic usually faster us cache data transfer bandwidth efficiently type

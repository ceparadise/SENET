Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I would like opinion analyze questionnaire risk assessment construction project
For question concerning specific risk project two answer An estimate probability occurrence risk scale one estimated impact risk project also range
A common way combine two value multiplying
Then according chosen organization matrix I could determine combination probability impact result classified high risk moderate risk low risk
I could use qualitative response analyze data
However I want lose information risk probability risk classified high treated differently arises high probability instead high impact
The impact changed probability might reduced taking appropriate measure
What would form data matrix I want keep qualitative quantitative response question
What method suggest analysis
Economists project manager usually use cost function analyse kind problem
So imagine cost associated occurrence bad output let call equal c much lose lawsuit employee injure much cost rebuild broken structure
Imagine also probability bad output occur function effort avoid convert effort monetary term let call x
double check safety specification demand extra worker therefore extra salary
So function could like P f x So problem choose x minimize f x
Numeric example Suppose Them total cost f total cost f The preferable x
So answer question Do make questionnaire ask risk use previous data
Take previous data check preventive action influence chance output
Get total cost associated preventive action put probability estimated probit model get table f
Use previous data determine average cost bad output c
Multiply every f c
Choose result smaller f
If previous data make questionnaire asking probability risk safety measure used
Then ask cost safety measure
If also historical data cost bad output ask
Then apply formula total cost expected find optimum amount money putting toward prevention
If I understand correctly issue work like sensitivity specificity
Look sensitivity specificity analysis many thing read
The concept two measure construct ROC curve deermine acceptable threshold

Risk management important function organization today
Companies undertake increasingly complex ambitious project project must executed successfully uncertain often risky environment
As responsible manager need aware risk
Does mean try address every risk project might face
Probably critical environment much expensive time resource
Instead need prioritize risk
If effectively focus majority time effort important risk
The Risk Chart provides useful framework help decide risk need attention
The Risk Chart based principle risk two primary dimension The chart allows rate potential risk two dimension
The probability risk occur represented one axis chart impact risk occurs

You use two measure plot risk chart
This give quick clear view priority need give
You decide resource allocate managing particular risk
The basic form Risk Chart shown figure
The corner chart characteristic It natural want turn matrix
The problem line dividing quadrant matrix lie
For example ignore percent probability risk cause percent maximum loss
And example pay maximum attention risk percent probability occurring loss percent maximum loss
In industry need pay close attention even unlikely risk risk involve injury loss human life example
Make sure pay due attention risk
To use Risk Chart print free follow step To successfully implement project must identify focus attention middle risk otherwise risk spreading effort thinly waste resource unnecessary risk management
With Risk Chart map risk position determines priority
risk critical put great deal effort managing
The risk risk next priority though may want adopt different strategy
risk often ignored

A matrix graphic representation risk facing given entity individual entire planet
The probability event plotted potential negative impact event
All point covered
Preparation Decide type data go matrix
You may use data prior research may make survey informed people
In survey might ask people rate impact probability truly quantifiable scale How much money would firm lose
What probability percent occurring within time frame
Alternatively survey might ask people rate impact looser scale Rate negative impact event scale impact catastrophe
Decide size matrix
The simplest matrix x high low level impact probability
A x involves three level high moderate low impact probability
Some matrix use even level
List event entered risk matrix example fail obtain patent terrorist attack
Make Event Coordinates Table five column
Label first column Event column write event listed
Label second column Impact third column Probability fourth column Impact Sector fifth column Probability Sector
Gather impact probability data event
If use survey data example What probability Event X occur
average survey data single figure
If use previous research data use method like weighted averaging come single figure probability impact event
Enter final data impact probability event Event Coordinates Table
Enter data Impact Probability column respectively
Determine categorize impact data
If x matrix might set High Impact event anything midpoint range figure impact
For example range potential financial loss million might set dividing line High Impact Low Impact event million
Alternatively might set dividing line arbitrarily example perhaps loss million High Impact
The decision must made matrix size x level You must determine boundary High Impact Moderate Impact Low Impact area
Write categorization impact data event example High Impact Moderate Impact Low Impact Impact Sector column Event Coordinates Table
Determine categorize probability data
If x matrix set High Impact event anything percent probability
With x matrix divide probability range equally across three area High Moderate Low Probability
Write categorization probability data event example High Probability Low Probability Probability Sector column Event Coordinates Table
Construction Draw outline Matrix
This chart Impact Risk one axis say positive Probability Risk axis say positive
Draw category decided upon earlier Section One Step Probability Impact ax
Place event matrix appropriate sector
Use Impact Sector Probabilities Sector column Event Coordinates Table determine correct placement event within matrix
Document choice
In note appended matrix describe collected data event impact probability Section One Step
Describe boundary region Impact Probability ax matrix Section One Steps

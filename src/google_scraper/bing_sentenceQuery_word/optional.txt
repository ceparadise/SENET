Computer program use data type organise different type data program
Data also constant variable within program function
The main purpose computer program

Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

In special kind used refer one piece data provided input subroutine
These piece data called
An ordered list parameter usually included time subroutine called argument call assigned corresponding parameter
Just standard mathematical usage thus actual input passed function procedure routine whereas variable inside implementation subroutine
For example one defines subroutine parameter called argument
Note variable calling context argument subroutine called argument
See section information
In common case parameter act within subroutine variable initialized value argument isolated copy argument argument variable case
argument supplied caller affected action within called subroutine discussed
In call value one thus think argument value properly think argument argument general argument simply value
The semantics parameter declared argument passed parameter subroutine defined language detail represented particular computer system depend system
The following program defines function named one parameter named price
The type price double
number
The function return type also double
After function defined invoked follows In example function invoked
When happens assigned price function begin calculating result
The step producing result specified enclosed
indicates first thing multiply value price give mean function produce result
Therefore final result ignoring possible error one encounter representing decimal fraction format
The term sometimes used interchangeably context used distinguish meaning
The term sometimes called often used refer variable found function definition sometimes called refers actual input passed
For example one defines function parameter called argument
A parameter unbound variable argument thought value variable depending calling convention
In case call value one think argument value properly argument example equivalent call call reference one think argument variable calling context
Parameters appear procedure definition argument appear procedure call
In function definition variable parameter function call value argument function
Loosely parameter type argument instance
A parameter intrinsic property procedure included definition
For example many language procedure add two supplied integer together calculate sum would need two parameter one integer
In general procedure may defined number parameter parameter
If procedure parameter part definition specifies parameter called
By contrast argument value supplied procedure called
Unlike parameter form unchanging part procedure definition argument may vary call call
Each time procedure called part procedure call specifies argument called
Although parameter also commonly referred argument argument properly thought actual value reference assigned parameter variable subroutine called
When discussing code calling subroutine value reference passed subroutine argument place code value reference given
When discussing code inside subroutine definition variable subroutine parameter list parameter value parameter runtime argument
For example C dealing thread common pas argument type cast expected type To better understand difference consider following function written The function two parameter named
It add value passed parameter return result subroutine caller using technique automatically supplied C compiler
The code call function might look like The variable initialized value
argument function context
At runtime value assigned variable passed function argument
In function parameter evaluated yielding argument respectively
The value argument added result returned caller assigned variable
Because difference parameter argument possible supply inappropriate argument procedure
The call may supply many argument one argument may wrong type argument may supplied wrong order
Any situation cause mismatch parameter argument list procedure often return unintended answer generate
Within software development method language term distinct us established convention
The term used exclusively reference routine input term used exclusively type parameterization
Consider following routine definition The routine take two argument called routine
A call specifies shown
Parameters also thought either
used definition generic class
In example class declared generic class two formal generic parameter representing data interest representing hash key data When class becomes client formal generic parameter substituted
In following attribute declaration used character string based
As data key formal generic parameter substituted actual generic parameter type
In parameter must specified procedure declaration
Languages using attempt discover type automatically function body usage
Dynamically typed programming language defer type resolution
Weakly typed language perform little type resolution relying instead programmer correctness
Some language use special keyword
indicate subroutine parameter formal function take empty parameter list whose type rather
The exact mechanism assigning argument parameter called depends upon used parameter typically call value may specified using keywords
Some programming language allow explicitly implicitly given subroutine declaration
This allows caller omit argument calling subroutine
If default argument explicitly given value used provided caller
If default argument implicit sometimes using keyword language provides value zero empty string etc
value provided caller
PowerShell example Default argument seen special case argument list
Some language allow subroutine defined accept
For language subroutine must iterate list argument
PowerShell example Some programming subroutine
This allows calling code
It also provides flexibility caller often allowing order argument changed argument omitted needed
PowerShell example In function exactly one parameter
What thought function multiple parameter usually represented lambda calculus function take first argument return function take rest argument transformation known
Some programming language like follow scheme
In language every function exactly one parameter may look like definition function multiple parameter actually definition function return function etc
Function application language well lambda calculus look like application function multiple argument correctly evaluated function applied first argument resulting function applied second argument etc
An also known parameter used output rather usual use input
Using parameter call value parameter value reference output parameter idiom language notably C language support output parameter
Languages support output parameter include see since see various procedural extension see scripting language see
More precisely one may distinguish three type parameter often denoted
An input argument argument input parameter must value initialized variable literal must redefined assigned output argument must assignable variable need initialized existing value accessible must assigned value argument must initialized assignable variable optionally assigned value
The exact requirement enforcement vary language example output parameter assigned read even assignment removed remove need auxiliary accumulator variable
These analogous notion expression value assigned value assigned respectively though term specialized meaning In case input distinguished output considered specific use case input output supported
The default mode varies language Fortran default C SQL extension input default TScript parameter explicitly specified input output
Syntactically parameter mode generally indicated keyword function declaration C
Conventionally output parameter often put end parameter list clearly distinguish though always followed
TScript us different approach function declaration input parameter listed output parameter separated colon return type function function computes size text fragment Parameter mode form stating programmer intent allowing compiler catch error apply optimization necessarily imply parameter passing actually occurs
Notably input parameter implemented call value output parameter call reference straightforward way implement mode language without support always implemented
This distinction discussed detail emphasizes parameter mode abstracted parameter passing mechanism reference copy actually implemented
For instance C input parameter default keyword passed value output parameter passed reference input parameter passed reference output parameter default passed value result copied back passed reference using compiler hint
A syntactically similar construction output parameter assign variable name function
This found Pascal example This semantically different called function simply evaluated passed variable calling scope store output
The primary use output parameter return multiple value function use parameter modify state using parameter passing rather shared environment global variable
An important use returning multiple value solve returning value error status see
For example return two variable function C one may write input parameter output parameter passed reference
A common use case C related language function place return value output variable return boolean corresponding whether function succeeded
An archetypal example method especially C par string integer returning success failure
This following signature may used follows Similar consideration apply returning value one several possible type return value specify type value stored one several output variable
Another use avoid assigning local variable function needing copy returning
This done output parameter implemented
For example instead usual one might instead write function need assign space object copy returning
Output parameter often discouraged modern programming essentially awkward confusing commonplace return value considerably easier understand work
Notably output parameter involve function side effect modifying output parameter semantically similar reference confusing pure function value distinction output parameter parameter subtle
Further since common programming style parameter simply input parameter output parameter parameter unusual hence susceptible misunderstanding
Output parameter prevent function composition since output stored variable rather value expression
Thus one must initially declare variable step chain function must separate statement
For example following function composition written output parameter instead becomes output parameter parameter In special case function single output parameter return value function composition possible output parameter address also returned function case becomes There various alternative use case output parameter
For returning multiple value function alternative return
Syntactically clearer automatic sequence unpacking used Python For returning value one several type used instead common case return value null indicate failure
For exception handling one return nullable type raise exception
For example Python one might either idiomatically The requiring local variable copying return using output variable also applied conventional function return value sufficiently sophisticated compiler
The usual alternative output parameter C related language return single data structure containing return value
For example given structure encapsulating width height one write In language instead using parameter one often use passing reference object mutating object though changing object variable refers

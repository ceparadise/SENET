used approach software process tailoring allowing increased efficiency process adherence respectively
This approach leverage preformed methodology
Hanssen Westerheim Bjørnson use brainstorming tailor software process organization
Baldassarre Caivano Visaggio Visaggio propose use pattern software process tailoring
As previously stated significant amount research exists process tailoring software engineering field
While similar research exists SE process tailoring opportunity exists apply software engineering research SE
By proposing model simplifies SE process tailoring article seek bridge gap SE literature SE process research stress importance tailoring yet offer little guidance perform function practitioner perform SE process tailoring meet specific need project
The proposed approach SE process tailoring offer significant number custom SE process variation compared preformed approach without reliance deep repository required approach
With proposed approach number tailoring decision could reduced total number element governing SE process number rule established within SE organization applied project
The next section article proposes SE Process Tailoring Model SEPTM developed starting tailoring consideration identified INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook published International Council Systems Engineering INCOSE used generate SE process based project unique characteristic environment
The discussion SEPTM followed section introduces analysis case study within Department Homeland Security DHS thereby evaluating model real world SE process tailoring instance
Finally article highlight conclusion research area future work
Figure present overview proposed SEPTM
At high level author constructed model based analysis generic SE process described INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook influence process tailoring
This analysis form basis initial set Tailoring Considerations TC
From initial set TCs subset selected applicable particular organization
A rule set developed link TCs organizational SE process
A system engineer apply rule set unique attribute project generate customized SE process based condition particular project
The following subsection describe activity
An important aspect model determining TCs used identify critical aspect project
The TCs broadly inform SE activity needed given project
The development initial organizational TC list based analysis general SE process described INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook discussion consideration enablers process tailoring INCOSE
The handbook state appropriate approach vary based unique need project
It also describes various approach including waterfall incremental agile approach
In waterfall approach project team performs SE stage serially incremental approach project team performs SE stage serially multiple time agile approach project team iterates short development cycle frequent product release Aoyama
As part agile development cycle project team perform SE stage requirement definition design development testing iterative fashion
Moreover project team perform update associated review documentation release Cao Ramesh
Each approach varies term stage review frequency well amount documentation required
As result project approach must critical TC
The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook also describes technical method includes section specialty engineering analysis must considered project system engineer however analysis apply every project INCOSE
For example interoperability considered project interface project
An organization may specific artifact required address interoperability certain project allow deleting interoperability artifact based project type
The handbook tailoring section includes discussion SE process tailoring identifies consideration enablers tailoring project scope risk tolerance complexity precedence system policy infrastructure INCOSE
While handbook identifies risk tolerance factor process tailoring advise importance placing tailoring emphasis system project objective project scope
Analysis general SE process tailoring discussion INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook resulted following list TCs Of TCs first Approach Project Scope Complexity Precedence System Policies organization INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook suggests
The remaining vary applicability depending type project organization executes
This requires organization determine appropriate subset TCs project portfolio
In second analytical step overarching TC list reduced one includes TCs relevant organization
This step performed comparing TC list organizational policy organizational SE process
For TC possible value identified
The TCs value either environmental impact need considered multiple approach may waterfall incremental agile
The case study next section article offer detailed discussion step performed
Before tailoring rule set developed tailoring operation must defined
For purpose research following definition apply Once TCs selected organization tailoring condition defined rule set must generated link TCs associated value element organization standard SE process
Process element SE task activity identified within organization SE process
Table show matrix used establish rule set
In area table element M standard SE process listed vertically
For example DHS SE process process element M
In area TC N associated value O listed horizontally
N represents number TCs identified organization value represent potential attribute project within organization
As example TC Interoperability Analysis potential value would yes given system may connected
For intersection process element combination area tailoring rule established
This requires two level decision
First determination made whether TC relevant particular process element second determination made value TC whether process element kept standard tailored deleted
Thus relevant intersection area contain either S standard T tailored D deleted
In summary resulting rule set list TCs value drive tailoring decision standard tailored deleted every relevant process element within organizational SE process
Once model developed organization project system engineer use tailoring SE process meet need specific project
To system engineer must solid understanding acquisition strategy project environment
This true whether applying methodology case tailoring SE process ad hoc fashion
To exercise model system engineer must align characteristic project value associated TC
Once complete model output tailored SE process identifying full set organization SE process element executed standard tailored deleted
After model applied situation organization must incorporate lesson learned back model reassessing organization list TCs organization rule set
Moreover SE research constantly refining best practice industry standard updated organization must also revisit initial TC set ass change industry
The objective research use project attribute approach reduce amount manual tailoring SE life cycle
et al
note determining best project methodology requires specific tailoring project unique situation
Measuring benefit activity based amount effort required tailor standard process Xu Ramesh
For purpose analysis article extends definition number manual decision required produce SE process
By design model fix number decision number TCs established organization
If organization applies initial TCs number manual decision
The DHS organization large acquisition portfolio SE process consisting process element resulting associated process tailoring decision DHS
Provided model reproduce tailoring decision made within DHS case study potential benefit proposed approach SE process tailoring demonstrated reducing manual decision described following subsection number TCs determined DHS case study
As following subsection focus accuracy model comparison case study
To perform case study analysis author required two key element
First organization SE policy required serve process baseline
The baseline used establish linkage overarching TCs process element contained within baseline
The data source research DHS Systems Engineering Lifecycle Process Guide DHS
The DHS SE process identifies nine SE stage technical review artifact executed life project total SE process element
The second key element required set tailored SE process implemented project within organization
The author selected DHS project analysis based data availability variability across TCs Table
For example project executed full research development others COTS acquisition executed waterfall development approach others incremental agile
The author gathered analyzed quantitative data regarding tailoring outcome project compared actual modeled tailoring outcome
The first step applying tailoring model organization determine subset overarching TCs applicable organization
As stated previously first four TCs apply organization adapted DHS TC list
Analysis DHS policy yielded additional consideration pertaining privacy intelligence
Additional analysis DHS SE process performed determine remaining applicable
Of five applicable project per DHS SE process five discussed DHS SE process guide five may apply depending need specific project
The five TCs may applicable included organizational TCs model
As result organizational TCs identified applied research follows With organizational TCs place rule set DHS established linking TCs standard DHS SE process depicted Table
Note given TC subset process element relevant empty table entry reflect relevance TC intersecting standard SE process element
For example Table four TCs relevant process element No

With rule set established DHS described previously next step input attribute project model generate custom SE process project
Figure depicts example project input output highlighting input addressing TCs based project characteristic output tailoring decision element within DHS SE process
Three question formed analysis TC
Table list question provides corresponding example using Security TC
The author assessed TCs comparing model output project data project SE process tailoring plan
A default process established based default project attribute within rule set
Projects attribute different default compared model particular attribute
For example default project attribute Security TC No therefore project security impact compared model ass whether project performed process element relevant TC
For given pairing process element tailoring consideration tailoring decision generated model project match tailoring decision actually executed project
For project security impact model project data include plan execute disaster recovery plan process element
For given pairing process element tailoring consideration percentage match project data corresponding model output exists
For project security impact percentage project included plan execute disaster recovery plan process element model suggests
What percentage process element least matching model output actual project data
What percentage process element relevant Security TC match model output actual project data
Table summarizes case study analysis approach using Security TC example
Questions listed Table trace Table
Column represents process element relevant Security TC
Column show tailoring decision model Security TC relevant process element next set column show pertinent data project assessment whether match model
The last column table calculates percentage project match model process element
Consistent validation study software engineering practice percent acceptable matching level used Daneva Ahituv Krishnan Kellner Ramasubbu Krishnan Kompalli
Thus TC considered valid model output relevant process element must match least percent relevant project last column Table least percent process element linked TC must meet threshold
This process described Security TC repeated TCs
Before presenting specific result case study analysis following key point must noted Table show result analysis comparing relevant project model output
The number project particular attribute provided
Overall result show nine TCs used reduce amount manual tailoring particular project
The one exception Project Size TC
As discussed previously limited specific research regarding application SE based project size specifically small project
Laporte Alexandre Renault discus need developing international standard address need small development organization one objective provide harmonized documentation integrating standard work product deliverable
This naturally extends SE within small organization large organization small project portfolio
Our analysis showed low correlation exists model small project case study
This occurred following project tailored process element recommended model project team executed average percent relevant process element
As result small size project leveraged opportunity tailor process element
Process tailoring critical effectively efficiently executing SE based unique characteristic project
Many SE process recommend tailoring supported tailoring guideline
This article examines previous research process tailoring software literature SE standard certain type project proposes model SE process tailoring
Our comparison SEPTM model several case study within DHS show process tailoring coupled project attribute viable approach reducing amount manual tailoring required given project
While research objective accomplished development initial model additional research performed area SE process tailoring

We make GUIDES tool available CCDSS developer implementers researcher funders clinician manager educator policymakers internationally
The tool recommendation generic make scalable large spectrum condition
Ultimately better implementation CCDSS may lead decision improved care patient outcome wide range condition
PROSPERO Application best research evidence clinical practice improve quality safety health care
Successfully translating evidence practice requires clinician aware evidence agree confident delivering intervention adhere appropriate situation
Furthermore patient agree adhere treatment
When one reasonable healthcare option involves weighing benefit harm option often scientific uncertainty preference patient
Unfortunately often gap recommended care care patient receive patient adherence appropriate care poor
Furthermore healthcare intervention may needed may even harmful
Finally expense decrease care option chosen according comparative
A computerised clinical decision support system CCDSS information technology aid clinician patient making healthcare decision based data
This broad term CCDSS come many type function
It installed local personal computer networked electronic health record function handheld device
The decision support provided screen paper
By linking healthcare provider relevant guideline point care CCDSS improve adherence recommendation
CCDSS also empower motivate patient providing advice improve disease
Further CCDSS could facilitate shared healthcare provider patient together providing decision aid
Hopeful government made substantial investment healthcare information technology decision support capability
It become apparent however required investment greater initially planned result many initiative fall short expectation
Systematic review CCDSS reported modest improvement healthcare process
Even newest generation CCDSS touted fully integrated electronic health record deliver modest reduction morbidity
Despite popular claim mere integration CCDSS electronic health record sufficient obtain clinical benefit
Some study estimate alert ignored case
Even though CCDSS potentially improve quality care also hold risk new type adverse effect sometimes leading patient harm
Unintended consequence CCDSS come various category report mentioning type
Alert fatigue example le well known automation bias user tend computer output
Over example described computerised provider system often integrated CCDSS
Furthermore recommendation provided CCDSS always failing meet standard trustworthiness well agreed upon guideline community
The benefit patient remain uncertain problem addressed
The Tailored Implementation Chronic Diseases TICD project developed method tailor knowledge implementation intervention chronic illness care consistent evidence benefit tailored implementation
In tailored implementation strategy knowledge translation based assessment determinant healthcare practice achieve desired change
The TICD project however address specific CCDSS implementation
Current CCDSS implementation often superficially tailored local context always involve user neither patient health professional
Although multiple determinant successful development use CCDSS proposed contested
As stated recent editorial lead author comprehensive systematic review beginning understand factor make implementation decision support effective might necessary chart new course
Caution needed since implementation CCDSS system growing substantially
Therefore Guideline Implementation Decision Support project GUIDES aim improve impact CCDSS optimised implementation based trustworthy decision support content

If conflict would arise specific implementation determinant expert participate discussion develop guidance item
The author also collaborate international expert group provide input feedback tool
Two researcher SVDV SF use systematic method review framework systematic review process evaluation qualitative evidence pertaining factor successful CCDSS implementation
The research question Which factor contribute successful implementation CCDSS Which framework used organise factor What evidence impact factor
We focus implementation recommendation using CCDSS also include research evidence framework implementation CCDSS general
We consider different type CCDSS objective
diagnosis treatment test ordering screening healthcare setting directed healthcare professional patient
From holistic point view also include paper implementation health information system general CCDSS included scope
We define success desired change effectiveness safety efficiency responsiveness equity health service based upon outcome proposed Cochrane Effective Practice Organisation Care EPOC review group

academic detailing increase success CCDSS
A protocol systematic review registered PROSPERO database
The search strategy described
Our file reference list relevant paper supplement search
To select study two reviewer screen title abstract retrieved reference
One author SVDV screen full text exclude irrelevant study
Any disagreement resolved discussion third person POV
We apply language restriction
The reviewer independently ass selected framework according desirable framework attribute defined TICD project
One reviewer SVDV extract identified domain determinant selected paper use list identified determinant domain compose draft framework
To construct expand TICD checklist
When specificity CCDSS requires adapt existing item add new concept exclude irrelevant item
For every included factor foresee short explanation
SF quality check new aggregated list comparing TICD checklist list factor identified review
If systematic review review qualitative study provide evidence importance specific determinant indicate confidence evidence high moderate low
Depending type evidence ass mean GRADE CerQual approach
To evaluate quality two reviewer independently apply ROBIS tool systematic review CerQual tool review qualitative evidence
Next invite expert within field CCDSS developer implementers evaluate preliminary framework
To compile list people include corresponding author every relevant paper found review phase combine suggestion member GUIDES project
It goal include person across different country setting
Experts requested declare potential conflict interest
Every participating expert receive preliminary framework first part structured feedback form desirable framework attribute see Additional file
The feedback form tested previously TICD project
We use formal consensus method consultation expert group
SVDV summarise score per question make thematic summary comment suggestion
SF verify accuracy procedure
The group author discus feedback agree consensus revision made
Next send revised version expert group request score independently item framework question How important determinant success CCDSS intervention mean Likert scale important important
Then item calculate median score range percentage score
Based new framework existing TICD worksheet discussion among author feedback key expert plan develop tool support tailoring implementation strategy recommendation CCDSS
We also integrate finding DECIDE project develops evaluates communication strategy support evidence informed decision
The tool contain overview CCDSS implementation success factor best practice checklist worksheet regarding identification implementation determinant matching implementation intervention
They also contain practical recommendation planning running tailored CCDSS implementation intervention
Each tool include definition explanation use combined example
To ensure usability usefulness tool consider comprehensiveness consistency framing usability
The group expert receive another invitation feedback time tool developed using part feedback form Additional file
The tool tested development tailored implementation strategy CCDSS patient knee osteoarthritis
From many potentially relevant condition chosen knee osteoarthritis prototype associated considerable disability general population high economic burden cause major public health problem quality indicator pas rate remarkably low
The clinical information used CCDSS come clinical practice guideline systematic review patient decision aid knee osteoarthritis
We submitted protocol pilot study separate publication
In short organise focus group Norway Belgium Finland inform development tailored CCDSS implementation strategy knee osteoarthritis recommendation
We test decision support situation related strong weak conditional recommendation issue
The experience application used tool
To get multiple perspective use GUIDES tool also plan invite CCDSS developer implementers workshop
We collect feedback discus within author group adjustment tool needed
Further use GUIDES framework systematic review trial CCDSS success feature PROSPERO database registration number
During data extraction process pair reviewer independently code identified trial using determinant listed GUIDES framework
We calculate agreement record frequency coding
It clear substantial work necessary realise full potential CCDSS guidance optimal design implementation CCDSS urgently required
This project provide guidance tool method identifying implementation determinant selecting strategy implement recommendation CCDSS
We make GUIDES tool available CCDSS developer implementers researcher funders clinician manager educator policymakers internationally
The tool recommendation generic make scalable large spectrum condition
Due time budgetary constraint pilot GUIDES tool one clinical condition
This limitation project since implementation determinant might differ clinical topic
Having patient information available electronic health record format considered important implementation CCDSS
This allows healthcare professional record patient characteristic make possible computer process data
However design clinical documentation tool bridge gap daily medical data international nomenclature classification remains challenge
Furthermore tool need adopted healthcare provider date significant amount patient data available format
Overcoming barrier obviously challenge wider objective time span project

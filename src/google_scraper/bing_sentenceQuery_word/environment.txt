Credit Lindsay France Cornell University Two hundred environmental computer scientist convened four day June First International Conference Computational Sustainability held Cornell University
The conference goal establish develop research community around field computational sustainability aim develop computational mathematical model method management resource needed solve problem confronting sustainability today rapidly developing world
As conservationist environmental scientist gave presentation however became apparent knowledge computational technique applicable problem want solve lag behind state art computer science
Likewise computer scientist mathematician unaware ecological problem often translate interesting decision optimization statistical learning problem involving combinatorial decision dynamic modeling uncertainty say Carla Gomes director Cornell Institute Computational Sustainability
We must first find common language Gomes said
This new intellectual territory great potential unique societal benefit
Several computer scientist created algorithm environmental application presented conference
Carlos Guestrin professor computer science Carnegie Mellon University former graduate student Andreas Krause assistant professor computer science Caltech example optimizing placement sensor detect contamination drinking water distribution system
They also developed algorithm enables robot detect algal bloom predict even previous data exists occur next
Vipin Kumar head computer science engineering department University Minnesota spoke global scale pattern biosphere process impact global carbon cycle
He colleague NASA investigating use data mining algorithm detect change global land cover using satellite data
Kumar team developed novel recursive merging algorithm identify change time series data applied MODIS enhanced vegetation index California produced detailed information forest fire conversion farmland residential area conversion desert farmland commercial us
Throughout conference environmental scientist encouraged computer scientist collaborate
Michael Runge research ecologist Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center said colleague believed solution many complex way wanted formulate ecological decision problem
I realized thinking problem said
I eye opened number tool available mathematics computational side
The question How connect amazing tool huge demand application ecological problem
We need people bridge communication field people see disease dynamic water supply contamination problem look lot like telecommunication network problem say Runge
We also need people chug applied work necessarily novel academic standpoint critical applied standpoint

Margaret taught many Biology Environmental Science course Master degree Environmental Science Education
What think would happen tree rainforest cut chemical spilled river snow rain fall increased drastically
These many topic studied field environmental science
Overall field science study interaction physical chemical biological component environment also relationship effect component organism environment
The field environmental science divided three main goal learn natural world work understand human interact environment also determine affect environment
The third goal determining human affect environment also includes finding way deal effect environment
Environmental science also referred field incorporates information idea multiple discipline
Within natural science field biology chemistry geology included environmental science
When people think environmental science think natural science aspect make environmental science complex broad field also includes field social science humanity
The social science field incorporated environmental science include geography economics political science
Philosophy ethic two field within humanity also included environmental science
By combining aspect natural science social science humanity field environmental science cover concept also examine problem topic many different point view
At current time world around u changing rapid pace
Some change beneficial many change causing damage planet
The field environmental science valuable resource learning change affect world live
Let examine major change currently occurring relationship environmental science
The large change dramatic increase number human earth
For human history population le million people current population skyrocketed seven billion people
This equal seven thousand time people
Due increase human population also increase pressure natural resource ecosystem service rely survival
include variety substance energy source take environment use
Natural resource divided renewable nonrenewable resource
substance replenished period time sunlight wind soil timber
On hand substance finite supply run
Nonrenewable resource include mineral crude oil
Due increase human population natural resource used rapid rate past
Although renewable natural resource replenished used rapidly replenished fast enough meet human demand
Even worse nonrenewable natural resource used rapidly become closer running completely gone forever
Natural resource referred produced environment respect ecosystem service rely help produce merchandise
environment natural process provide u resource need support life
Common ecosystem service include water air purification nutrient cycling climate regulation plant recycling waste
Just like natural resource ecosystem service also limited used regulated
Now let tie together think population growth influence natural resource ecosystem service
As human population increase natural resource ecosystem service used rapidly potentially degraded future human earth jeopardy
This one major example environmental science important valuable
By studying happening environment human affecting changing may possible develop solution depletion natural resource ecosystem service
Without study environmental science development solution environmental problem would likely resource would run existence human earth might limited

Although focus environment important understand difference
As previously learned environmental science field science study interaction physical chemical biological component environment relationship effect component organism environment
The key word field science demonstrates environmental science rooted scientific investigation knowledge
Environmentalism hand necessarily based science
social movement based political ethical view environment
Most environmentalist people dedicated protecting environment resource provides ensure life specie
Although environmental scientist environmentalist may similar passion world live differ way approach address passion
Now let review basic environmental science
field science study interaction physical chemical biological component environment also relationship effect component organism environment
Environmental science broad science field strives answer question natural world function human interact environment also human influence environment
In particular environmental science used study human utilize substance replenished period time sunlight timber also substance finite supply run crude oil mineral
The field environmental science includes many different specific field
By combining many different discipline study environmental science gain insight environment obtain better understanding environmental problem possible solution problem
Environmental science collaborative field people many different field working together ensure future environment entire planet
After completing lesson student understand definition aim environmental science able discus interaction scientific field including geology chemistry biology

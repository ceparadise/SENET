Using network allows share Networking critical want use computer communicate
Without send email text instant message
We use huge network daily basis called
Around three billion people use internet share data news resource amongst many thing
If connect computer device together network expose problem
If network break make number task used quite difficult
For example might possible share photograph opinion friend
If computer device networked together expose
Most virus spread network hacker use network access people computer
Without network connection hacker would physically get computer

Networks created two computer connected
Files sent network data packet
Networks made different topology
A created one device connected together
A network small collection computer connected within building eg school business home wide collection computer connected around world
The main purpose networking share data computer
A file broken small chunk data known data packet order transmitted network
The data reach destination computer
Networking hardware required connect computer manage data packet communicated

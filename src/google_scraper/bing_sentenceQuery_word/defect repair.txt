In computer science technical writing especially software engineering difference fault error defect
I want quote To quote Typically word used refers defined
However different culture standard may use somewhat different meaning term led attempt define
Partial definition taken standard Error computed result correct Fault incorrect step process data definition computer Failure incorrect result Mistake human action produce incorrect Based understanding definition error result fault failure
Could someone explain clearly
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
This question came site academic enrolled higher education
According A system event occurs delivered service deviate correct service
A system may fail either comply specification specification adequately describe function
An part system state may cause subsequent failure failure occurs error reach service interface alters service
A adjudged hypothesized cause error
I understand another name fault
confusing represent fault failure depending context

Standard surgical closure atrial septal defect via sternotomy safe effective procedure low morbidity mortality
Considering young female patient frequently operated atrial septal defect minimally invasive procedure avoiding sternotomy convincingly desirable led approach right anterolateral minithoracotomy
The recent clinical introduction robotically assisted surgery reduced skin incision enabled totally endoscopic procedure port
This article report first series atrial septal defect closure first case operated August totally endoscopic closed chest technique using telemanipulation system
We performed totally endoscopic atrial septal repair using da Vinci surgical system Intuitive Surgical Mountain View Calif consecutive adult patient
Median age year preoperative New York Heart Association functional class
Left ventricular ejection fraction normal patient mean pulmonary artery pressure amounted mm Hg
Shunt volume ranged
All patient displayed fossa ovalis type atrial septal defect multiperforated
Neither intraoperative postoperative complication occurred
Two patient converted minithoracotomy due endoaortic balloon clamp failure
Length operation minute cardiopulmonary bypass time minute
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography certified complete closure atrial septal defect patient
The totally endoscopic technique yielded excellent cosmetic result
Totally endoscopic atrial septal repair feasible safe procedure good clinical result excellent cosmetic outcome
It may considered perfect adjunct interventional treatment option
Further study larger cohort randomized trial necessary document potential benefit
Evolution robotic technology refinement procedural flow may shorten procedural time decrease cost

I started managing project long time ago
We used lot fun early day
During period common joke organization A competent Project Manager portray every Defect Change Request
On hand intelligent Client introduce every Change Request Defect
Don get wrong
Project management serious affair
But happy team go extra mile complete project task
It always good deal serious thing humorous manner
This one joke kept u spirited motivated
There many thing used
At time pretty serious project task
Our first priority take meet project objective keep customer happy
Let u talk today
In observation Project Managers taken joke literally
Some Project Managers try go one Customers
In short run might reduce work
It might even seem prudent thing
But long run cause lot
It spoil relationship creates distrust
I believe healthy discussion attitude give take always resolve tough situation
In opinion Guide also helped matter
Guide categorized
The Guide explain anything
So left reader interpret mean
customer
Let u answer question answering series question
A defect stated need specification
A defect fault inconsistency imperfection affect function deliverable component whole system
You also refer Guide look definition Defect
A wilful act modify deliverable component whole system remove Defects make deliverable component whole system conformant stated need specification
I taken following definition post
You refer post definition related Change Change Management
A Change Request formal documented proposal submitted Change Control Board CCB taking decision Change
A CR document contains complete description Change along Impact Analysis
No
Defect certainly change
Since Defect stated need specification
Yes Defect Repair could CR
But always true
A Defect Repair considered Change Request special circumstance
You give faulty system defective deliverable component Customer
So Defects repaired delivery
However
The Project Team may require Defect Repair
These may require Changes Project Baselines
Like Change Project Team analyze Defect Repair completely
They document impact Defect Repair The Project Team analyse impact Defect Repair Project parameter
The Project Team document much would impacted
Project team produce formal CR impact analysis suggests
Guide definitive Guide
It present possibility
I described one possibility
You read Guide correlating concept real life example
In business fairly simple
Defect Repair CR first place client nevers accepts defective equipment
Hence mean defect appeared accepted
May missed pointing fault
So I defect repair give extension time
If happens defect liability period warranty period case I free else customer pay
If happens defect liability period meant Nice post Sir
Thanks Vasi If Defect repair affect baseline need create CR
Hope I understood correctly
If reevaluated control quality document basis
work defect repair tracked
Bhala If Defect Yes understood correctly
control quality document Quality Control activity planned upfront
schedule made resource allocated etc
So defect repaired within original plan repair considered change
But repair requires extra CR required extra
Hope help
Praveen Thanks reply
After repaired deliverable revalidated control quality
So Change log contain corrective action plan used inform team member correct defect used revalidate deliverable control Quality process
The used record lesson learned also
Am I right
Bhala You right
In addition corrective action plan could document dev team validate defect repair

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

PMP Exam Preparation Study Materials Lessons Learned Contact Hours PMP FAQ etc
By Corrective Action Preventive Action Defect Repair commonly used key element quality management system
You must understand term order better command quality management process
Therefore blog post I going explain three quality management term example could acquire better understanding term
Okay let get Defect Repair easy defect
However difference corrective action preventive action thin many people get confused trying differentiate
In corrective action try take action correct event happened past
Whereas preventive action take action avoid mitigate potential event may occur future
Let u discus detail
process repairing defective part replacing needed
For example let u say manufacturing component
Suddenly see component bad shape kind discrepancy
You physically inspect material see defect corrected
If defect corrected correct
And defect corrected simply replace
Defect Repair also known correction performed product meet quality requirement
future response defect repair process correction cause error occur
For example let u say inspection find defective component corrected defective component
Now want defect happen
Therefore look root cause problem find solution apply operation defect occur
In word say Corrective Actions step taken correct root problem stop recurrence deviation
Corrective Action reactive process performed bring deviation control
action taken avoid anticipated future defect may appear component
For example let u say going start production component
Before starting production process think defect may appear component
Therefore review process procedure make change needed cause anticipated defect could prevented
Preventive Action proactive process
Please note difference Corrective Action Preventive Action
In corrective action problem occurred try make sure problem recur
On hand preventive action problem yet occurred
You simply take measure problem occur
In word say preventive action process identification likely cause potential order prevent initially occurring
Preventive Actions performed ensure deviation baseline
This Corrective Action Preventive Action Defect Repair
Please share thought comment section
image credit Corrective action defect repair
Are two Corrective action defect repair go hand hand

Can corrective action occur without occurrence defect repair
It case would called Preventive Action
Yes
You right
Really interesting article
Can explain bit Non Conformance Request link relationship towards repair corrective preventive action
Would repair automatically trigger non conformance request
Or would non conformance request triggered repair showed manufacturing procedural fault caused defect product
I would also interested knowing wheter difference way need handling whether fault caused supplier discovered product inspection whether discovered customer triggered repair request
It depends situation
It manual error item corrected change request
However defect due faulty procedure change request may issued
Dear Fahad Could please clarify corrective defect repair different Change control process
Is P C DR change baseline whereas change request
If yes may change request affect performance baseline different
Thanks continuous support help
Anmol Preventive action corrective action defect repair cause change request
For example error occurred project execution although corrected defect repair cause lot time
Therefore may raise change request change schedule baseline
Hi Fahad thanks explain please preventive action considered mitigation avoidance respnse plan
thnaks Hello Michael As per understanding deal preventive action fact accordingly project plan developed

A error flaw cause produce incorrect unexpected result behave unintended way
The process fixing bug termed often us formal technique tool pinpoint bug since computer system designed also deter detect various computer bug operation
Most bug arise mistake error made either program component used program
A caused producing incorrect code
A program contains large number bug bug seriously interfere functionality said defective
Bugs trigger error may
Bugs may subtle effect cause program computer
Other bug qualify might example enable bypass order
Some software bug linked disaster
Bugs code control machine directly responsible patient death
In US billion rocket destroyed le minute launch due bug guidance computer program
In June Royal Air Force helicopter killing
This initially dismissed pilot error investigation convinced inquiry may caused software bug aircraft
In study commissioned US concluded software bug error prevalent detrimental cost US economy estimated billion annually percent gross domestic product
The term bug describe defect part engineering jargon since predates electronic computer computer software may originally used hardware engineering describe mechanical malfunction
For instance wrote following word letter associate It invention
The first step intuition come burst difficulty thing give Bugs little fault difficulty month intense watching study labor requisite commercial success failure certainly reached
The Middle English word basis term term used monster
first mechanical game advertised free bug
Problems military gear referred bug
In book published speaking powered machine said Ice sawing suspended creator could brought take bug darling
used term bug relate issue robot short story Catch That Rabbit published included collection short story
From page Catch That Rabbit Robots get bug multiple robot plenty bug always least half dozen bug left
The term bug used account computer pioneer publicized cause malfunction early electromechanical computer
A typical version story In Hopper released active duty joined Harvard Faculty Computation Laboratory continued work
Operators traced error Mark II trapped relay coining term
This bug carefully removed taped log book
Stemming first bug today call error glitch program
Hopper find bug readily acknowledged
The date log book September
The operator found including William Bill Burke later familiar engineering term amusedly kept insect notation First actual case bug found
Hopper loved recount story
This log book complete attached moth part collection Smithsonian
The related term also appears predate usage computing etymology word contains attestation context aircraft engine
The concept software might contain error date back speaks possibility program card erroneous analysing process must equally performed order furnish Analytical Engine necessary data herein may also lie possible source error
Granted actual mechanism unerring process may give wrong order
The Open Technology Institute run group New America released report Bugs System August stating policymakers make reform help researcher identify address software bug
The report highlight need reform field software vulnerability discovery disclosure
One report author said Congress done enough address cyber software vulnerability even though Congress passed number bill combat larger issue cyber security
Government researcher company cyber security expert people typically discover software flaw
The report call reforming computer crime copyright law
The Computer Fraud Abuse Act Digital Millennium Copyright Act Electronic Communications Privacy Act criminalize create civil penalty action security researcher routinely engage conducting legitimate security research report said
There ongoing debate use term bug describe software error
One argument word bug divorced sense human caused problem instead implies defect arose leading push abandon term bug favor term defect limited success
Since somewhat humorously suggested use term blunder
In software engineering Greek change form refers evolution defect final stage software deployment
Transformation mistake committed analyst early stage software development lifecycle lead defect final stage cycle called metamorphism
Different stage mistake entire cycle may described mistake anomaly fault failure error exception crash bug defect incident side effect
The software industry put much effort reducing bug count
These include Bugs usually appear programmer make
Various innovation designed make bug le likely easier spot
Some typo especially symbol allow program operate incorrectly others missing symbol misspelled name may prevent program operating
Compiled language reveal typo source code compiled
Several scheme assist managing programmer activity fewer bug produced
address software design issue well applies many technique prevent defect
For example formal state exact behavior program design bug may eliminated
Unfortunately formal specification impractical anything shortest program problem
involves writing test every function unit program perform
In unit test written code code considered complete test complete successfully
involves frequent software release relatively small change
Defects revealed user feedback
Open source development allows anyone examine source code
A school thought popularized say popular chance bug software given enough eyeball bug shallow
This assertion disputed however computer security specialist wrote easy hide vulnerability complex little understood undocumented source code even people reviewing code mean qualified
An example actually happening accidentally
include feature help prevent bug static restricted
For example programmer writes pseudocode although may syntactically correct code fails
Compiled language catch without run program
Interpreted language catch error runtime
Some language deliberate exclude feature easily lead bug expense slower performance general principle almost always better write simpler slower code inscrutable code run slightly faster especially considering substantial
For example support arithmetic implementation language often runtime array least debugging build
Tools help developer inspecting program text beyond compiler capability spot potential problem
Although general problem finding programming error given specification solvable see tool exploit fact human programmer tend make certain kind simple mistake often writing software
Tools monitor performance software running either specifically find problem give assurance correct working may embedded code explicitly perhaps simple statement saying provided tool
It often surprise find time taken piece code removal assumption might cause code rewritten
people whose primary task find bug write code support testing
On project resource may spent testing developing program
Measurements testing provide estimate number likely bug remaining becomes reliable longer product tested developed
Finding fixing bug major part
early computing pioneer described realization late much rest life would spent finding mistake program
Usually difficult part debugging finding bug
Once found correcting usually relatively easy
Programs known help programmer locate bug executing code line line watching variable value feature observe program behavior
Without debugger code may added message value may written console window log file trace program execution show value
However even aid debugger locating bug something art
It uncommon bug one section program cause failure completely different section thus making especially difficult track example error graphic routine causing file routine fail apparently unrelated part system
Sometimes bug isolated flaw represents error thinking planning part programmer
Such require section program overhauled rewritten
As part stepping code imagining transcribing execution process may often find error without ever reproducing bug
More typically first step locating bug reproduce reliably
Once bug reproducible programmer may use debugger tool reproducing error find point program went astray
Some bug revealed input may difficult programmer
One cause radiation machine death bug specifically occurred machine operator rapidly entered treatment plan took day practice become able bug manifest testing manufacturer attempted duplicate
Other bug may disappear program run debugger humorously named
Since particularly following disaster interest automated aid debugging rose
Some class bug nothing code
Faulty documentation hardware may lead problem system use even though code match documentation
In case change code eliminate problem even though code longer match documentation
frequently hardware bug since make new version much cheaper remanufacturing hardware especially
Bug management includes process documenting categorizing assigning reproducing correcting releasing corrected code
Proposed change software bug well enhancement request even entire release commonly tracked managed using
The item added may called defect ticket issue following paradigm story epic
Categories may objective subjective combination area software severity priority well type issue feature request bug
impact bug system operation
This impact may data loss financial loss goodwill wasted effort
Severity level standardized
Impacts differ across industry
A crash video game totally different impact crash web browser real time monitoring system
For example bug severity level might crash hang workaround meaning way customer accomplish given task workaround meaning user still accomplish task visual defect example missing image displaced button form element documentation error
Some software publisher use qualified severity critical high low blocker trivial
The severity bug may separate category priority fixing two may quantified managed separately
control bug fall list planned change
The priority decided software producer
Priorities sometimes numerical sometimes named critical high low deferred note may similar even identical severity rating looking different software producer
For example priority bug may always fixed next release bug may never fixed
Industry practice employ inverted scale highest priority low number larger number indicate lower priority
It common practice release software known bug
Most big software project maintain two list known bug known software team told user
The second list informs user bug fixed specific release may offered
Releases different kind
Bugs sufficiently high priority may warrant special release part code containing module fix
These known
Most release include mixture behavior change multiple bug fix
Releases emphasize bug fix known release
Releases emphasize feature known major release often name distinguish new feature old
Reasons software publisher opts patch even fix particular bug include In software development project mistake fault may introduced stage
Bugs arise oversight misunderstanding made software team specification design coding data entry documentation
For example relatively simple program alphabetize list word design might fail consider happen word contains
Or converting abstract design code coder might inadvertently create fail sort last word list
Errors may simple typing error intended
Another category bug called may occur program multiple component executing time
If component interact different order developer intended could interfere stop program completing task
These bug may difficult detect anticipate since may occur every execution program
Conceptual error developer misunderstanding software must
The resulting software may perform according developer understanding really needed
Other type The amount type damage software bug may cause naturally affect process policy regarding software quality
In application since software flaw potential cause human injury even death software far scrutiny quality control example online shopping website
In application banking software flaw potential cause serious financial damage bank customer quality control also important say photo editing application
NASA managed reduce number error fewer per line code felt feasible project business world
A number software bug become usually due severity example include various space military aircraft crash
Possibly famous bug also known bug feared worldwide economic collapse would happen start year result computer thinking
In end major problem occurred
The involved one incompatibility old API new API

Metadata data describes data
prefix information technology usage mean underlying definition description
Metadata summarizes basic information data make finding working particular instance data easier
For example example basic document metadata
Having abilty filter metadata make much easier someone locate specific document
In addition document file metadata used image video spreadsheet web page
The use metadata web page important
Metadata web page contain description page content well keywords linked content
These usually expressed form
The metadata containing web page description summary often displayed search result search engine making accuracy detail important since determine whether user decides visit site
Metatags often evaluated search engine help decide web page relevance used key factor determining position search late
The increase search engine optimization towards end led many website keyword stuffing metadata trick search engine making website seem relevant others
Since search engine reduced reliance metatags though still factored indexing page
Many search engine also try halt web page ability thwart system regularly changing criterion ranking Google notorious frequently changing ranking
Metadata created manually automated information processing
Manual creation tends accurate allowing user input information feel relevant needed help describe file
Automated metadata creation much elementary usually displaying information file size file extension file created created file

Metadata defined cue seem normal data
Examples cue mentioned Now I confused exactly metadata include microblogs difference metadata normal data microblogs
For example number follower data
But data metadata
Metadata infamously term
Roughly speaking trying get distinction along following line data content care metadata information secondary exists primarily technical reason addressing information tag technical data facilitate storage communication
A classical analogy postal mail
The content letter considered data
The address envelope might considered metadata
Of course bit level data
But talk distinction usually trying draw distinction main content user care v secondary information used enable system work
Again term metadata vague ambiguous
Do expect precise technical definition term
Instead plan use term communication precise meaning important make sure state clearly mean metadata consider metadata

Although different researcher hold different view term exactly mean see main goal use understand automatic learning become flexible solving different kind learning problem hence improve performance existing learn learning algorithm hence alternative term
Flexibility important learning algorithm based set assumption data
This mean learn well bias match data learning problem
A learning algorithm may perform well one learning problem badly next
From point view pose strong restriction use technique since relationship learning problem often kind effectiveness different learning algorithm yet understood
By using different kind like property learning problem algorithm property like performance measure pattern previously derived data possible learn select alter combine different learning algorithm effectively solve given learning problem
Critiques meta learning approach bear strong resemblance critique said related problem

A proposed definition qualifies meta learning system considers three requirement The term bias last point refers set assumption influencing choice hypothesis explaining data must confused notion bias represented
Meta learning concerned two aspect learning bias declarative bias specifies representation space hypothesis affect size search space
represent hypothesis using linear function procedural bias imposes constraint ordering inductive hypothesis
preferring smaller hypothesis
These view approach meta learning please note exist many variation general approach

information provides information data
Three distinct type metadata exist
Metadata traditionally used library converted catalog data digital database
In digital format becoming prevalent way storing data information metadata also used describe digital data using
There different metadata standard different discipline collection etc
Describing data increase usefulness
For example may include metadata specifying software language page written HTML tool used create subject page find information subject
This metadata automatically improve reader experience make easier user find web page online
A may include metadata providing information musician singer songwriter whose work appears disc
A principal purpose metadata help user find relevant information discover resource
Metadata also help organize electronic resource provide digital identification support archiving preservation resource
Metadata assist user resource discovery allowing resource found relevant criterion identifying resource bringing similar resource together distinguishing dissimilar resource giving location information
Metadata telecommunication activity including traffic widely collected various national governmental organization
This data used purpose used mass
In many country metadata relating email telephone call web page video traffic IP connection cell phone location routinely stored government organization
For example may include metadata describes large picture color depth image resolution image created shutter speed data
A text document metadata may contain information long document author document written short summary document
Metadata within web page also contain description page content well key word linked content
These link often called Metatags used primary factor determining order web search late
The reliance metatags web search decreased late keyword stuffing
Metatags largely misused trick search engine thinking website relevance search really
Metadata stored managed often called
However without context point reference might impossible identify metadata looking
For example database containing several number digit long could result calculation list number plug equation without context number perceived data
But given context database log book collection number may identified information refers book information within book
The term metadata coined Philip Bagley book Extension Programming Language Concepts clear us term ISO traditional sense structural metadata
data container data rather alternate sense content individual instance data content metacontent type data usually found library catalogue
Since field information management information science information technology librarianship widely adopted term
In field word defined data data
While generally accepted definition various discipline adopted specific explanation us term
While metadata application manifold covering large variety field specialized model specify type metadata
Singley distinguish two distinct class metadata guide metadata
describes structure database object table column key index
help human find specific item usually expressed set keywords natural language
According metadata divided similar category technical metadata business metadata
corresponds internal metadata corresponds external metadata
Kimball add third category
On hand NISO distinguishes among three type metadata descriptive structural administrative
typically used discovery identification information search locate object title author subject keywords publisher
describes component object organized
An example structural metadata would page ordered form chapter book
Finally give information help manage source
Administrative metadata refers technical information including file type file created
Two administrative metadata right management metadata preservation metadata
explains intellectual property right contains information preserve save resource
An additional type metadata beginning developed
new concept library however advance universal design raised profile
Projects like GPII identified lack common terminology model describe need preference user information fit need major gap providing universal access solution

Those type information accessibility metadata
incorporated several accessibility property based IMS Global Access All Information Model Data Element Specification
The Wiki page list several property value
While effort describe standardize varied accessibility need information seeker beginning become robust adoption established metadata schema developed
For example Dublin Core DC audience MARC reading level could used identify resource suitable user dyslexia DC Format could used identify resource available braille audio large print format work done
Metadata metacontent correctly vocabulary used assemble metadata metacontent statement typically structured according standardized concept using metadata scheme including
Tools used apply standardization metadata
Structural metadata commonality also paramount importance development
Metadata metacontent syntax refers rule created structure field element metadata metacontent
A single metadata scheme may expressed number different markup programming language requires different syntax
For example Dublin Core may expressed plain text
A common example guide metacontent bibliographic classification subject
There always implied statement classification object
To classify object example Dewey class number Topology
book number spine implied statement book subject heading
This triple importantly triple
The first two element triple class attribute piece structural metadata defined semantic
The third element value preferably controlled vocabulary reference master data
The combination metadata master data element result statement metacontent statement
metacontent metadata master data
All element thought vocabulary
Both metadata master data vocabulary assembled metacontent statement
There many source vocabulary meta master data UML EDIFACT XSD SKOS Pantone Linnaean Binomial Nomenclature etc
Using controlled vocabulary component metacontent statement whether indexing finding endorsed If indexer searcher guided choose term concept relevant document retrieved
This particularly relevant considering search engine internet Google
The process index page match text string using complex algorithm intelligence inferencing occurring illusion thereof
Metadata schema hierarchical nature relationship exist metadata element element nested relationship exist element
An example hierarchical metadata schema schema metadata element may belong parent metadata element
Metadata schema also linear element completely discrete element classified according one dimension
An example linear metadata schema schema one dimensional
Metadata schema often two dimensional planar element completely discrete element classified according two orthogonal dimension
In case metadata schema exceed planar depiction type required enable display view metadata according chosen aspect serve special view
Hypermapping frequently applies layering geographical geological information overlay
The degree data metadata structured referred
Granularity refers much detail provided
Metadata high granularity allows deeper detailed structured information enables greater level International standard apply metadata
Much work accomplished national international standard community especially American National Standards Institute International Organization Standardization reach consensus standardizing metadata registry
The core metadata registry standard Metadata Registries MDR framework standard described
A new edition Part final stage publication early
It revised align current edition Part extends MDR support registration Concept Systems
see
This standard specifies schema recording meaning technical structure data unambiguous usage human computer
standard refers metadata information object data data data
In information object data Data Elements Value Domains reusable semantic representational information object describe meaning technical detail data item
This standard also prescribes detail metadata registry registering administering information object within Metadata Registry
Part also provision describing compound structure derivation data element example calculation collection one data element form derived data
While standard describes originally data element registry purpose support describing registering metadata content independently particular application lending description discovered reused human computer developing new application database analysis data collected accordance registered metadata content
This standard become general basis kind metadata registry reusing extending registration administration portion standard
The Geospatial community tradition specialized standard particularly building tradition catalogue
Formal metadata usually essential geospatial data common approach applicable
The metadata term set vocabulary term used describe resource purpose discovery
The original set classic metadata term known Dublin Core Metadata Element Set endorsed following standard document Although standard also mentioned section approach semantic markup seek existing tag convey metadata
Microformat follows XHTML HTML standard standard
One advocate microformats characterized problem alternative approach Metadata may written file identify owns copyright contact information brand model camera created file along exposure information shutter speed etc
descriptive information keywords photo making file image searchable computer Internet
Some metadata created camera input photographer software downloading computer
Most digital camera write metadata model number shutter speed enable edit functionality available Nikon DSLRs since new Canon camera since Pentax DSLRs since Pentax
Metadata used make organizing easier use
Filters used analyze specific set photograph create selection criterion like rating capture time
Photographic Metadata Standards governed organization develop following standard
They include limited Information time origin destination phone call electronic message instant message mode telecommunication opposed message content another form metadata
Bulk collection metadata intelligence agency proven controversial disclosure Intelligence agency NSA keeping online metadata million internet user year regardless whether person interest agency
Metadata particularly useful video information content transcript conversation text description scene directly understandable computer efficient search content desirable
There two source video metadata derived operational gathered metadata information content produced type equipment software date location metadata improve search engine visibility discoverability audience engagement providing advertising opportunity video publisher
In today society professional video editing software access metadata
Avid MetaSync Adobe Bridge two prime example
Metadata created either automated information processing manual work
Elementary metadata captured computer include information object created created last updated file size file extension
In context refers following Data virtualization emerged new software technology complete virtualization stack enterprise
Metadata used data virtualization server enterprise infrastructure component alongside database application server
Metadata server saved persistent repository describe various enterprise system application
Structural metadata commonality also important support data virtualization
Standardization work large impact effort build metadata system statistical community
Several metadata standard described importance statistical agency discussed
Applications standard Census Bureau Environmental Protection Agency Bureau Labor Statistics Statistics Canada many others described
Emphasis impact metadata registry statistical agency
Metadata used various way mean cataloging item library digital analog format
Such data help classify aggregate identify locate particular book DVD magazine object library might hold collection
Until many library catalogue used inch card file drawer display book title author subject matter abbreviated string indicated physical location book within library shelf
The employed library classification library material subject early example metadata usage
Beginning many library replaced paper file card computer database
These computer database make much easier faster user keyword search
Another form older metadata collection use US Census Bureau known Long Form
The Long Form asks question used create demographic data find pattern distribution
employ metadata commonly part
Metadata obtained resource book periodical DVDs web page digital image
This data stored integrated library management system using metadata standard
The purpose direct patron physical electronic location item area seek well provide description question
More recent specialized instance library metadata include establishment including repository digital image library
While often based library principle focus use especially providing metadata mean follow traditional common cataloging approach
Given custom nature included material metadata field often specially created
taxonomic classification field location field keywords copyright statement
Standard file information file size format usually automatically included
Library operation decade key topic effort toward

Additionally museum often employ standardized commercial collection management software prescribes limit way archivist describe artwork cultural object
As well collecting institution museum use describe cultural object artwork collection
reputable within museum community recommended CCO standard
Museums encouraged use controlled vocabulary contextual relevant collection enhance functionality digital information system
Controlled Vocabularies beneficial within database provide high level consistency improving resource retrieval
Metadata structure including controlled vocabulary reflect system created
Often process cultural object described categorized metadata museum reflect perspective maker community
Metadata instrumental creation digital information system archive within museum made easier museum publish digital content online
This enabled audience might access cultural object due geographic economic barrier access
In museum adopted archival standard created intricate database discussion museum database come museum archival library science community
Collection Management Systems CMS tool local shared system
scholar note many benefit interoperability museum database collection also acknowledging difficulty achieving interoperability
Problems involving metadata becoming widespread
Courts looked various question involving metadata including metadata party
Although Federal Rules Civil Procedure specified rule electronic document subsequent case law elaborated requirement party reveal metadata
In October ruled metadata record
Document metadata proven particularly important legal environment litigation requested metadata include sensitive information detrimental certain party court
Using clean redact document mitigate risk unwittingly sending sensitive data
This process partially see protects law firm potentially damaging leaking sensitive data
In Australia need strengthen national security resulted introduction new metadata storage law
This new law mean security policing agency allowed access two year individual metadata aim making easier stop terrorist attack serious crime happening

I working ASP application code template file organized way allow alter anything outside body tag
So I thinking inserting meta tag inside body like I wondering good put meta tag inside body HTML document
How affect This course per
META tag like say TITLE putting BODY essentially creating invalid markup
From cursory test seems browser
Firefox Safari actually put element HEAD creating document tree
This surprising browser known tolerate try interpret kind broken markup
Having
handling browser might lead various rendering behavioral inconsistency
Instead relying browser guessing best follow standard
I know search engine react tag soup I would risk experimenting find Perhaps parse HEAD tag certain information skip tag altogether
Or maybe consider malicious gambling attempt page containing markup
Who know
The bottom line avoid whenever possible
The bottom line avoid whenever possible
I think definitely permitted useful case using microdata
Example I would
That tag go search engine might view spamming
If reorganize master page always add contentplaceholder head section
I done trivially This way add whatever content like head section back page If aim search engine optimization probably good idea follow standard put meta tag
However far browser behavior go place tag still function
I decided test using multiple tag tag otherwise document
The result test Firefox Firefox Firefox Mobile Chrome Chrome Mobile Opera So happens use meta tag body
By large seem work fine
The meta tag probably processed ca put head I would fret much
Some meta tag meant search engine honored search engine body section page
For example Google say honor body page head page
We allow BODY I mentioned people would spam I would say use
I found meta tag inside body various webpage one top search google
It show least searh engine mind used approach
You must go ahead way around
I put meta tag body Microdata technology
When I regular element info I need describe object according vocabulary I set meta tag content
I prefer way instead set element display none
The way display none may cause google problem instead far I know
I agree best practice I validate document I pas validation zero error
Also I done trick several project none problem google search engine
Even microdata improve search engine ranking
I know exactly want meta tag body I saw microdata code
If need approach I think ok case meta element must head section
Having META Description tag website invalid markup however huge issue search engine regularly find tag ever
My website look HTML The META website BODY however indexed google page meta description set click though text google search result

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Alex Tu advanced placement student take computer science class Midwest City Okla

Alex Tu advanced placement student take computer science class Midwest City Okla
There sharp decline number computer science class offered secondary school
A handful nonprofit group working address see national education crisis Too America public school actually teach computer science basic fewer still offer credit
It next decade million job tech sector computer science graduate fill
And percent school teach computer science
So education technology sector industry year growing stepping
At Silicon Valley hotel recently venture capitalist interested party heard funding pitch watched demonstration startup backed incubator called
One aim teach kid year old younger fundamental programming game guide fuzz ball
As soon start learning coding earlier start learning something better later life say Grechen Huebner Kodable
She working two computer screen demonstrate game work
Kids drag drop symbol get fuzzy character go maze learn condition loop function even debugging say
So kid barely shed diaper really learn code
Huebner think vital
We kid young using
Five kinda sweet spot
My daughter behind I think
She started coding
Bad parent
Even kid offered computer science concept growing consensus student get exposed basic computer science concept early
Kodable startup hope make profit filling enormous void American public education
Ninety percent school even teach
So parent school even offer class kid going preparation need century say Hadi Partovi nonprofit
Just like teach electricity work biology basic also know Internet work apps work
Schools need add curriculum
Through Partovi working get kid parent school interested computer science curriculum
public elementary school Baltimore recently took part Hour Code start learn basic coding even though realize
So moving three block press start one say
Gretchen LeGrand nonprofit trying bring computer science fundamental underserved kid city
She say huge challenge district resource
The computer old outdated
We either ca install software want use teach computer programming connection slow say
She adapt teaching coding without computer teacher calling teaching Partovi say teaching computer science esoteric knowledge computer geek filling job Google Microsoft
Most job big company
It training globally competitive workforce keeping every sector economy thriving
Our future lawyer doctor politician businessmen folk job need little bit background world around work Partovi say
It around u every industry get impacted
According study largest adopted secondary school standard computer science
At time sharp decline last five year number introductory advanced placement AP computer science class offered secondary school
Ironically decline come state tout improvement science technology engineering math STEM curriculum
And several voiced deep concern new Common Core state standard promote significant computer science content either math science
There bright spot Los Angeles recently boosted commitment expanding computer science offering
But long way go say Chris Stephenson directs Computer Science Teachers Association
She say big problem profound confusion computer science
Too many parent administrator conflate gaming basic literacy computer science principle practice computing coding
I administrator actually say good intention know kid learning computer science school computer school
And true Stephenson say
I think understand access computer learning computer science Bunsen burner cupboard learning chemistry say
There scientific discipline ca learn playing around technology
The guesstimate percent school teach computer science based largely data student take computer science annually
The real percentage may lower
Nobody track figure nationally
Some sobering stats last year AP data It crazy small
I mean would absurd scary terrifying Stephenson say
So never mind digital divide growing digital information divide
Computer science education seems privileged knowledge accessible mostly affluent kid
The people likely succeed access kid really need look fact figure horrified Stephenson say
She say Hour Code reached million student around world terrific start
But credit say knowledge gap continue widen

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

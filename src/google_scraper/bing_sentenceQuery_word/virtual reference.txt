In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

Not real
The term popular among scientist used wide variety situation
In general distinguishes something merely conceptual something reality
For example refers imaginary set location
It imaginary sense area real physical memory composed
The difference bit like difference architect plan house actual house
A computer scientist might call plan Another analogy difference brain mind

In computing computer system
Virtual machine based provide functionality physical computer
Their implementation may involve specialized hardware software combination
There different kind virtual machine different function Some virtual machine designed also emulate different architecture allow execution software application operating system written another architecture
allows resource computer partitioned via support multiple isolated instance usually called may look feel like real machine
A VM originally defined efficient isolated duplicate real computer machine
Current use includes virtual machine direct correspondence real hardware
The desire run multiple operating system initial motive virtual machine allow among several operating system
In respect system virtual machine considered generalization concept historically preceded
IBM first system allow implemented providing user operating system CMS
Unlike virtual memory system virtual machine entitled user write privileged instruction code
This approach certain advantage adding device allowed standard system
As technology evolves virtual memory purpose virtualization new system may applied manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machine one computer operating system
It may possible share identical content among multiple virtual machine run physical machine may result mapping physical page technique termed
This especially useful page holding code segment case multiple virtual machine running similar software software library web server middleware component etc
The guest operating system need compliant host hardware thus making possible run different operating system computer prior version operating system support future software
The use virtual machine support separate guest operating system popular regard
A typical use would run simultaneously preferred complex operating system Linux Windows
Another use would novel unproven software still developmental stage run inside
Virtual machine advantage operating system development may include improved debugging access faster reboots
Multiple VMs running guest operating system frequently engaged server consolidation
A process VM sometimes called MRE run normal application inside host OS support single process
It created process started destroyed exit
Its purpose provide programming environment abstract away detail underlying hardware operating system allows program execute way platform
A process VM provides abstraction compared ISA abstraction system VM
Process VMs implemented using performance comparable compiled programming language achieved use
This type VM become popular implemented using
Other example include run VM called
All serve computer language
A special case process VMs system abstract communication mechanism potentially heterogeneous
Such VM consist single process one process per physical machine cluster
They designed ease task programming concurrent application letting programmer focus algorithm rather communication mechanism provided interconnect OS
They hide fact communication take place attempt present cluster single machine
Unlike process VMs system provide specific programming language embedded existing language typically system provides binding several language
Examples PVM MPI
They strictly virtual machine application running top still access OS service therefore confined system model
Both system virtual machine process virtual machine date continue area active development
grew notably implemented CTSS
allowed multiple user use computer program appeared full access machine one program executed time system switching program time slice saving restoring state time
This evolved virtual machine notably via IBM research system used used early example
The first widely available virtual machine architecture see detail
An important distinction using multiple virtual machine one host system using one virtual machine host system prototyping SIMMON
hardware emulation earlier system compatibility date back software emulation simulation predates
arose originally abstract platform used program early example date around
An early example virtual machine executes object code emitted compiler
This abstraction allowed compiler easily ported new architecture implementing new took existing compiled machine code underlying physical machine
The language used similar design intermediate language named portable
This popularized around notably system compiler termed resulting machine
This influential virtual machine sense often generally called machine
In addition intermediate language Pascal also executed directly interpreter implementing virtual machine notably influenced later interpreter notably JVM
Another early example written SNOBOL Implementation Language SIL assembly language virtual machine targeted physical machine transpiling native assembler via
Macros since fallen favor however approach le influential
Process virtual machine popular approach implementing early microcomputer software including adventure game implementation engine like argues possibly portable virtual machine ever created
Significant advance occurred implementation particularly implementation pushed forward implementation approach us process virtual machine
Later notable Smalltalk VMs
A related language produced lot virtual machine innovation programming language pioneered
These technique proved commercially successful Java virtual machine
Other innovation include virtual machine better match underlying hardware rather virtual machine closer match programming language pioneered language
In full virtualization virtual machine simulates enough hardware allow unmodified guest OS one designed run isolation
This approach pioneered IBM predecessor family
Examples outside mainframe field include discontinued formerly called GSX Server vBlade technology
In virtualization hardware provides architectural support facilitates building virtual machine monitor allows guest OSes run isolation
virtualization first introduced IBM use first virtual machine operating system
In provided additional hardware support virtualization
Sun Microsystems added similar feature processor
Examples virtualization platform adapted hardware include
In hardware support found rarely offer performance advantage software virtualization
In virtualization physical server virtualized operating system level enabling multiple isolated secure virtualized server run single physical server
The guest operating system environment share running instance operating system host system
Thus also used implement guest environment application running given guest environment view system
The pioneer implementation example include AIX Parallels Virtuozzo Containers

Virtual reality mean creating immersive environment convincing user react way would real life
The idea block sensory input outside use visual auditory cue make virtual world seem real
While concept simple actually building virtual reality system proven difficult recently
The big difference sensory deprivation say game developer Eric Giz Gewirtz chief creative officer Seismic Games Los Angeles
You susceptible real experience primitive level tuning everything
The term virtual reality date back far though case referring theater
In Morton Hellig cinematographer invented machine called Sensorama
The machine used wraparound screen viewed device get effect seat moved vent blow air viewer stereo sound simulate activity like riding motorcycle
The Sensorama remained novelty though
Once modern computer appeared along television early movie science fiction writer picked possibility creating environment would look feel real Ray Bradbury short story The Veldt describes nursery run artificial intelligence run amok
That concept virtual reality world mimic reality one earliest instance concept recognize today
Yet meaning virtual reality enter popular lexicon
Science fiction author William Gibson one early popularizer term famously novel Neuromancer
Even clear concept simulating world Bradbury Gibson Star Trek holodecks
Better computer sophisticated graphic processor got video game designer interested making game real
A famous example Atari Battlezone version involved looking viewer
Virtual reality headset would wait
Sega tried introducing one managed get arcade
The headset could track user motion keep field view aligned head would virtual landscape
The headset called Sega VR failed break home market however
Even military got act Department Defense attempted use virtual reality simulation pilot training
It turned traditional flight simulator superior people using VR headset would get nauseous
Virtual reality headset seemed go way earlier gimmick like Oculus VR built Oculus Rift HTC created Vive
Both new headset considerable advance earlier effort
The visuals realistic design headset better blocking outside stimulus
Gewirtz add dealing nausea go long way well
Changing frame rate animation helped well designing movement gradual
It lateral movement say
Your eye telling one thing brain via balance sensor inner ear telling something else
That said new headset got better part focused hearing sight two sens people engaged
Early idea virtual reality included suit still people working
In general though technology gotten smaller portable
We really gone opposite direction full suit Gewirtz say though possible could change future
This make current VR different even earlier video game allowed sit pilot seat since distraction outside world
Those game always quietly aware booth Gewirtz say
Virtual reality offer option game developer even best ordinary console game
Since VR headset track one eye focused allows character make eye contact
That provokes visceral response player
character also feel closer
They invasion personal space Gewirtz say That make people uncomfortable
Another thing virtual reality simulate somewhere else also known telepresence
One could imagine making environment simulates mountaintop example offering kind vicarious travel peak Everest Grand Canyon
Already Oculus VR showcasing Oculus Rift conjunction HBO Ascend Wall traveling exhibit us Rift simulation capability give fan experience riding elevator top foot wall ice
The possibility endless Gewirtz say
There real language making interactive content VR
No one know like traditional cinema game
This wo like glass add

I Googled long time I still understand work explanation technical illustration make clearer
My primary confusion virtual memory
I hope question good explanation people ask question find Google
I admit two concept seem quite complicated similar beginning
Sometimes also taught confusingly
A good reference opinion found For sake completion I try explain I guarantee correctness I developed OS month
Segmentation older concept opinion confusing
Segmentation work name say
A segment continuous block memory specific size
To access memory within segment need
This make total two address component fact stored two register
One idea segmentation enlarge memory register
The sort protection elaborate one paging
Because use two register access memory split memory chunk said called segment
Consider memory
This split bit register segment byte
Of course also bit register offset
Addressing byte bit quite useless decided segment overlap I think also performance programming reason back
The following formula used access memory segmentation This mean segment time offset
This also mean address accessed many way
also
This segmentation old day
If look assembler program try something see even called register assembler CS DS code segment data segment
Later called GDT introduced
This global table specific position RAM segment number memory address several option segment given
This brings u nearer concept paging still
So programmer decide segment start
A new concept also GDT one could decide long segment
So segment long bit register limit could defined programmer
You could overlapping segment also purely separated segment
When accessing A B still two register used accessing memory A entry GDT
So look entry GDT see memory location segment start large
We check B offset within allowed memory area
Now paging different newer segmentation approach paging page fixed size
So limit longer programmable page currently
Furthermore unlike segmentation logical address space continuous without physical address continuous
Paging also us table look stuff still split logical address part
The first part number entry page table second part offset
However offset fixed length bit access
You also two part multiple page table used
Two level page table quite common system I think even three level page table common
I hope I able explain least bit I think exaplanation also confusing
Best thing dive kernel programming try implement basic stuff booting OS
Then find everything due backwards compability everything still modern PCs
I direct Segmentation starting die
I suspect paging well future
Edit Let add clarification Segmentation paging two difference mean memory management typically two thing
At risk oversimplification Segmentation allows process access memory natural pointer size would allow
Paging allows process access memory system physically support
Segments The bit system
That allows addressing memory
Late system much memory
A process could map different segment physical memory
A process could access memory could change memory could access within
The successor brought segmenting high art
Using even complex system base register process could access larger area memory
Paging Is system process see continuous relatively range memory address divided page
For example VAX processor bit address allowing access memory theoretically computer typically memory
A process could access much memory system physically plus multiple process
These system presented continuous range memory process virtual memory divided page around byte defined set table mapped disk storage
If process accessed page memory triggered hardware exception
The operating system would intercept exception allocate new page physical memory load memory disk restart instruction
If operating system needed memory handle request would page memory already loaded
If data read usually would loaded executable image would paged
The page could marked invalid
If memory page would written page file storage needed
The Intel chip introduced bizarre system combined segment paging
Segments used data protection
The processor mode away

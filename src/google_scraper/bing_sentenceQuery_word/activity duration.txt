discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Rochester Institute Technology Department Computer Science give look different type problem challenge opportunity computer scientist face ever increasing technological world

It around time last year I began fret little
The novelty summer holiday started wear fear began settle
After couple year teaching ICT I getting little bored churning coursework looking new challenge would really make student think
Do get wrong ICT place I felt like student missing getting mix computer science ICT
So I came plan start delivering computing September
Having previously studied internet technology university taught ICT almost four year bit geek I felt quite secure subject knowledge computing feeling confident programming skill
The first thing thing I sign site user learn teach code free began working exercise
I chose Python coding language choice quite close written English plenty support material online
After week spending minute day working Python tutorial little often I decided attempt one GCSE programming project immediately became stuck
Online tutorial site great learning syntax programming language necessarily teach solve problem
This computational thinking come
After call help Twitter I quickly found tutored problem solving side thing via Skype email two amazing computer scientist
Problem solving essence computer science using computer tool solve real world problem
The way get good problem solving practice
Although I returned school September I still annual fear six week I actually quite excited get started
problem solving programming aspect computing provided really interesting contrast ICT I taught previously
My student felt success quicker gained confidence solving relatively simple problem whereas student came across something always get right first time
The lesson provided great platform differentiation task amazing see student take step back really think problem plan solution
One task I set student create program using Python take two number multiplies together print answer
At higher end student create calculator gave user option different thing depending option user chose
These problem tailored covered class topic variable data type selection
Students design solution paper code evaluate solution
There plenty time student got stuck usually logic error sometimes I know answer
So I advised I I know something use internet
Students started becoming quite proficient searching blog forum seek bit code would help
In hindsight I focused little much student learning syntax particular coding language rather embedding wider programming concept selection iteration something I going change approach upcoming school year
Also I found student responded well challenge solving problem rather following guide
Obviously need starting point tutorial site syntax guide give student
But I going start getting student thinking problem solving sooner see programming tool solving problem rather exercise must get right cost
I really glad I decided dive deep end computing
I believe student benefited much challenging engaging lesson subject matter computing tends lend
With computer science around u easy make link real world scenario student relate
Above I want student challenged lesson enjoy I think computing provides u great platform achieve

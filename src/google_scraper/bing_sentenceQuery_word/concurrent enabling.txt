A number mathematical model developed general concurrent computation including model
As Leslie Lamport note While execution considered year computer science concurrency began seminal paper introduced problem
The ensuing decade seen huge growth interest
Looking back origin field stand fundamental role played Edsger Dijkstra
Because computation concurrent system interact executed number possible execution path system extremely large resulting outcome
Concurrent use shared source indeterminacy leading issue
Design concurrent system often entail finding reliable technique coordinating execution data exchange execution scheduling minimize maximise
Concurrency theory active field research
One first proposal seminal work early
In year since wide variety formalism developed modeling reasoning concurrency
A number formalism modeling understanding concurrent system developed including Some model concurrency primarily intended support reasoning specification others used entire development cycle including design implementation proof testing simulation concurrent system
Some based others different mechanism concurrency
The proliferation different model concurrency motivated researcher develop way unify different theoretical model
For example Lee demonstrated model used provide common framework defining variety different model concurrency Nielsen Sassone Winskel demonstrated used provide similar unified understanding different model
The Concurrency Representation Theorem Actor model provides fairly general way represent concurrent system closed sense receive communication outside
Other concurrency system modeled Actor model using
The mathematical denotation denoted closed system constructed increasingly better approximation initial behavior called using behavior approximating function construct denotation meaning follows In way mathematically characterized term possible behavior
Various type used help reason concurrent system
Some logic allow assertion made sequence state concurrent system pas
Others build assertion sequence change state
The principal application logic writing specification concurrent system
encompasses programming language algorithm used implement concurrent system
Concurrent programming usually considered general involve arbitrary dynamic pattern communication interaction whereas parallel system generally predefined communication pattern
The base goal concurrent programming include
Concurrent system generally designed operate indefinitely including automatic recovery failure terminate unexpectedly see
Some concurrent system implement form transparent concurrency concurrent computational entity may compete share single resource complexity competition sharing shielded programmer
Because use shared resource concurrent system general require inclusion kind somewhere implementation often underlying hardware control access resource
The use arbiter introduces possibility major implication practice including correctness performance
For example arbitration introduces raise issue cause explosion state space even cause model infinite number state
Some concurrent programming model include
In model thread control explicitly timeslices either system another process

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
When looking concurrent programming two term commonly used
concurrent parallel
And programming language specifically claim support parallel programming
Does mean parallel concurrent programming actually different
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Distinguish parallelism using extra computational unit work per unit time concurrency managing access shared resource
Teach parallelism easier help establish sequential mindset
From A Introduction Parallelism Concurrency Dan Grossman version November Conurrency parallelism differ problem solve cause independent
Executing two task mean individual step task executed interleaved fashion
If disregard parallelism assume one statement executed point time priori guarantee task get execute next step
This useful regard Some main challenge Executing two task mean statement executed
This mainly useful Key challenge include See also distinguishing parallel distributed computing
In addition Nish answer let recommend Simon Marlow book
They answer first question Haskell perspective could better suited theoretically inclined reader Haskell purely functional lazy programming language much closer Mathematics language
Quoting In many field word parallel concurrent synonym programming used describe fundamentally different concept
A parallel program one us multiplicity computational hardware
multiple processor core order perform computation quickly
Different part computation delegated different processor execute time parallel result may delivered earlier computation performed sequentially
In contrast concurrency technique multiple thread control
Notionally thread control execute time user see effect interleaved
Whether actually execute time implementation detail concurrent program execute single processor interleaved execution multiple physical processor
I recommend reading rest tutorial let quote remainder section connects programming paradigm quantitative qualitative characteristic program efficiency modularity determinism
While parallel programming concerned efficiency concurrent programming concerned structuring program need interact multiple independent external agent example user database server external client
Concurrency allows program modular thread interacts user distinct thread talk database
In absence concurrency program written event loop callback indeed event loop callback often used even concurrency available many language concurrency either expensive difficult use
The notion thread control make sense purely functional program effect observe evaluation order irrelevant
So concurrency structuring technique effectful code Haskell mean code IO monad
A related distinction deterministic nondeterministic programming model
A deterministic programming model one program give one result whereas nondeterministic programming model admits program may different result depending aspect execution
Concurrent programming model necessarily nondeterministic must interact external agent cause event unpredictable time
Nondeterminism notable drawback however program become signifficantly harder test reason
For parallel programming would like use deterministic programming model possible
Since goal arrive answer quickly would rather make program harder debug process
Deterministic parallel programming best world testing debugging reasoning performed sequential program program run faster processor added
Indeed computer processor implement deterministic parallelism form pipelining multiple execution unit
While possible parallel programming using concurrency often poor choice concurrency sacriffices determinism
In Haskell parallel programming model deterministic
However important note deterministic programming model sufficient express kind parallel algorithm algorithm depend internal nondeterminism particularly problem involve searching solution space
In Haskell class algorithm expressible using concurrency

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I often hear phrase like concurrency semantics concurrency equivalence without reference
What term mean important
What example true concurrency equivalence need

case applicable standard equivalence bisimulation trace equivalence etc
The term true concurrency arises theoretical study concurrent parallel computation
It contrast interleaving concurrency
True concurrency concurrency reduced interleaving
Concurrency interleaved step computation one atomic computing action
exchange message sender receiver take place
Concurrency true one atomic action take place step
The simplest way distinguishing look rule parallel composition
In interleaving based setting would look something like P P This rule enforces one process parallel composition execute atomic action
For true concurrency rule like following would appropriate
P Q Q This rule allows participant parallel composition execute atomic action
Why would one interested interleaved concurrency concurrency theory really study system execute computation step parallel
The answer great insight simple form message passing concurrency true concurrency interleaving based concurrency contextually distinguishable
In word interleaved concurrency behaves like true concurrency far observer see
Interleaving good decomposition true concurrency
Since interleaving easier handle proof people often study simpler interleaving based concurrency
CCS
However simplicity disappears concurrent computation richer form observation
timed computation difference true concurrency interleaved concurrency becomes observable
Standard equivalence like bisimulations trace definition true interleaving based concurrency
But may may equate different process depending underlying calculus
Let give informal explanation interleaving truly concurrent interaction indistinguishable simple process calculus
The setting CCS calculus
Say program P x b Then following truly concurrent reduction P b This reduction step matched following interleaved step P x b b The difference former take one step latter two
But simple calculus detect number step used reach process
At time P following second interleaved reduction sequence P b b But also reduction sequence truly concurrent setting long true concurrency forced
interleaved execution allowed even potential one interaction time

In operating system happens several process thread running parallel
These thread may communicate either shared memory message passing
Distribution form concurrency communication simultaneous thread done exclusively via message passing
Distribution useful employ lenient scaling resource consumption economizes resource
Whereas shared memory concurrency often requires single processor per thread distribution allows several thread communicate one another
Concurrency also programming design philosophy
In concurrent programming programmer attempt break complex problem several simultaneous executing process addressed individually
Although concurrent programming offer better program structure sequential programming always practical
In concurrent system computation executed time diverge giving indeterminate answer
They system may end deadlock maximum assigned resource consumption executing thread
Thus design robust concurrency operating system programmer need reduce problem individual parallel task coordinate execution memory allocation data exchange task

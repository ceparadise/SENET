A composite key context relational database combination two column table used uniquely identify row table
Uniqueness guaranteed column combined taken individually column guarantee uniqueness
Any column guarantee uniqueness called candidate key however composite key special type candidate key formed combination two column
Sometimes candidate key single column sometimes formed joining multiple column
Consider example certain table database commercial bank
This table used store record individual bank account
Assuming table separate column account type C checking S saving followed another column year month account creation another column sequential number within month obvious one column identify account one deduce would several C Account Type column would several entry May Date Creation column
However three column combined unique record every account produced
A hypothetical account number example would C first account created July checking account
Another S fourth saving account created March
This composite key candidate key guarantee uniqueness two column joined together
A composite key defined primary key
This done using SQL statement time table creation
It mean data entire table defined indexed set column defined primary key

Database structure generally divided two respect namely flat database relational database
Relational database easier understand flat database
Because relational database simple design easy data operation
Database also relational structure found table store data
On table consists column row column define type information saved
Basically database useful time retain information categorized logically
For example want save information data database enterprise school group matter business become table
In database relationship relationship one one many many one many The key set column used identify access particular row row
Identified key explanatory table index constraint reference
The column part one key
A unique key key constrained two value
Unique key column contain NULL
For example column number employee defined unique key value column identifies one employee
No two employee number worker
The mechanism used enforce uniqueness index unique key
Unique index table column collection ordered column identifies value specify function unique row
A unique index contain NULL
The key one unique key defined table selected first important key
There one primary key table
A primary index automatically created primary key
The main index used database manager efficient access table row allows database manager enforce uniqueness primary key
You also specify index key column efficiently access data processing query
If table natural unique key order arrival method used distinguish unique row use time stamp part key help
Weld Line Automation Weld Line Programming If column table contains duplicate determine key one column
A key one column composite key
The combination column value define unique entity
If composite key easily defined also considered create new column unique
A foreign key field table corresponding relationship candidate key table
Foreign key used table
For example suppose two table customer includes customer data order table includes customer order
Intention order must associated client customer table
To place foreign key order table relates key customer table
Identifying foreign key column set column table refers column set column another table
Column table must reference key pillar super key referenced table
Value reference column line must occur single row referenced table
Thus row reference table contain value exist referenced table except potentially null
In way reference made link information together important part database normalization
Various row table reference may refer row referenced table
Most time reflects parent table reference table many child table referencing table relationship
Below example relationship Company also schedule Contact
Tables company parent link
In child contact schedule Field CompanyID table show contact contacted company owned
Diversification foreign key defines many record child table link record master table
In example child diversity since company number contact
Primary Key Foreign Key Relationship It Primary Foreign Key figure relationship two key

One One One Many Many Many
This indicated Key field equivalent schedule
show field identifies unique record
For example product Order value normally produced field
intrinsic meaning integer automatically generated one one
This indicated field table
In case field also created key example attitude Schedule Key Primary Key Table composite key consisting two field
The Primary Key table Primary Key table
common real world easy read Parents child
In figure show One Product attributed Many
The line product continuous line small dotted line
This mean field Primary Key Table
A dotted line show existence Foreign Key
Relationship important real world able see around u every day
For example many customer may order product
Many product ordered customer
This called Relationship
It implemented directly Database Table relationship
The solution create intermediate table record combination exist Customer Product
For example customer ordered three product three record customer intermediate table
Low key combination parent table primary key intermediate table
We also need allow comment like stronger
If get right database structure easy extend
Explain main characteristic advantage following term
Relational Database b Object Oriented Database c Object Relational Database Can connected database collection data item strongly recommended set name Minister Finance official explained Any data easily accessible
A database created using model relation relationship
The software used database relation database management system called Relations
A relationship database preferred choice storing data compared model hierarchical database model network model
The first database commenced namely Edgar Codd
data update easy without change information different file
info always date chance remaining old data forgotten file
typo avoid problem data type Excel dreaded syndrome
avoid unwanted conversion like November November validated data data entry filter impossible data existing information
With database combine different data easily
No force data different format
Do away intermediate Excel spreadsheet often generated manipulating data
And often dare delete case contain important information
Data manipulation done using query
This mean Structured Query Language SQL merge update manage data user need know SQL perform complex task
In Microsoft Access example Visual Query Builder provides simple intuitive interface make query
A database adjusted reveal new area investigation present large quantity data intuitive form
Often pattern become apparent data
With special database possible new way data many different source brought together displayed quickly fast
Ends Excel file subtlety different
Never sure correct file delete case
With relational database dilemma past
Your data set analysis created using query stored database
No copy made data instead link query directly statistic
The main goal development guarantee system enjoy longer life maintenance cost much le
This process system contained behavior reused included recent behavior
The ultimate goal new development Objects operational system prone model real world complete fashion traditional method
Objects organized class object behavior
Based object rather data processing system far reliable traditional system especially new behavior built existing object
Because object dynamically called accessible new object created time
New object inherit data attribute one many object
Behavior inherited novel behavior added without performing function existing system
Database Object capability expanded additional tie new data type access method function available object oriented programming
add character string data type
Complex data type combine feature data type already exist database
able determine data type text containing desired time number byte used create user defined data type opaque
also add virtual processor
By using encapsulation database object want contact form table
For example Table includes name address phone number email address contact
Through class encapsulating Contacts combine information table one
So query database information generate report style designed include information

About SQL When two field table together identify record uniquely proper way calling
Composite compound key
I seen web us I really sure
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
Both composite key compound key describe candidate key one attribute
According Relational Database Dictionary mean thing
In ER modelling term compound key also specific meaning
It mean key whose constituent attribute reference key entity
compound key form identifying relationship
For purpose especially useful important concept term often treated interchangeable
It probably best stick composite key unless referring specifically ER modelling concept compound key
I still sure consulted
It clearly state correct In database design key consists attribute uniquely identify entity occurrence
Each attribute make compound key simple key right
This often confused whereby even though also key consists attribute uniquely identify entity occurrence least one attribute make composite key simple key right
A composite key made element may may foreign key
Example In table Transaction detail key TransactionId ItemNumber
A transaction detail subentity transaction
TransactionId foreign key referencing Transactions table
ItemNumber key
It uniquely identifies item within context single transaction
A compound key key whereby part key foreign key
Example hotel reservation system reservation compound key GuestId HotelId ArrivalDate
GuestId identifies Guest reference Guests table
HotelId identifies Hotel reference Hotels table
ArrivalDate identifies Date
There may may Dates table reference identifies Entity Date either way
Also note factoid A simple key key made one column whereas composite key made two column
In English composite key
For instance take look MSDN website search containing sql composite key
Assuming question regard Relational Databases I searched neutral definition A composite key key made two attribute within table together uniquely identify record A composite key consists one attribute uniquely identify entity occurrence
This differs compound key one attribute make key simple key right
For example database holding CD collection
One entity called track hold detail track CD
This composite key CD name track number
It sound like composite key superset includes compound key
If accept composite key made one attribute kind compound key made one simple key
A compound key type composite key specific meaning term composite key always appropriate use

In partitioning
The composite pattern describes group object treated way single instance type object
The intent composite compose object tree structure represent hierarchy
Implementing composite pattern let client treat individual object composition uniformly
The Composite design pattern one describe solve recurring design problem design flexible reusable software object easier implement change test reuse
When defining object object act container object client must treat separately complicates client code
This enables client work interface treat object uniformly object perform request directly object forward request child component recursively downwards tree structure
This make client class easier implement change test reuse
See also UML class object diagram
When dealing data programmer often discriminate branch
This make code complex therefore error prone
The solution interface allows treating complex primitive object uniformly
In composite object designed composition similar object exhibiting similar functionality
This known relationship object
The key concept manipulate single instance object would manipulate group
The operation perform composite object often relationship
For example defining system portray grouped shape screen would useful define resizing group shape effect sense resizing single shape
Composite used client ignore difference composition object individual object
If programmer find using multiple object way often nearly identical code handle composite good choice le complex situation treat primitive composite homogeneous
In class refer class directly separately
Instead refers common interface treat uniformly
The class child implement interface directly
The class maintains container child object forward request
The object collaboration diagram show interaction In example object sends request object type tree structure
The request forwarded performed child object object downwards tree structure
There two design variant defining implementing operation like child component container accessing child component The Composite design pattern emphasizes
As described pattern also involves including method main Component interface Composite subclass
More recent description sometimes omit method
The following example written implement graphic class either ellipse composition several graphic
Every graphic printed
In It could extended implement several shape rectangle etc
method etc

ETA My question based upon keeping optimal database
What difference database composite primary key would presumably index table using PK index
From reading seems I went approach I would create unique index two column
Would I still need create index two column
If essentially mean every column table would index
Is quintessential dilemma database size index v performance
So I following entity I wish create In simplified example ProjectUserAttributeTypes going I showing table
Let say I want create two boolean ProjectUserAttributeType called
I would simply create two row
Now I want assign user attribute I would add row A DBA warned using composite primary key general performance reason
However instance I fail see I gain NOT using composite
In case I need make sure non null unique value column
I surely need index well
My ultimate objective able query database find user certain attribute combination
I would join table filter project use clause filter even
A example There two main design relational database With natural key use key given A project identified project number user login name number etc
This often lead compound composite key The table compound key project number plus user name uniquely identifying record telling u working project
With IDs usually add technical ID used link record meaning user The table contain field plus IDs need unique null constraint natural key plus constraint IDs
The necessary course table needing reference
But often table get ID whether needed make look alike IDs already case needed later
At first glance seems database based IDs work index nothing gained case
An ID concept often chosen give freedom
An example What would happen project number could change
With natural key project number many table would get updated cascadingly somehow become quite task
In ID database would change project ID one place
And hat would happen suddenly project number unique within company
In ID based database would add project table add unique index done
With natural key company number ILN
artificial number
would added primary key would introduced child table
So When design database natural key must think get stable natural key sometimes none invent
With IDs care much whether field change
An ID based database thus easier implement
Then hierarchy
Lets say several company database item warehouse
Natural key IDs With ID concept name stock table known parent table
To store would even redundant whereas natural key concept needed part compound key without would lose link parent table
This purity seen people great advantage ID concept natural key
However come disadvantage
In natural key database guaranteed company item company warehouse company part key stock table
With ID concept linked warehouse record could belong company linked item record company
Inconsistent data caused wrong insert statement DBMS could prevent u
With natural key error occur
And I want know many stock company I simply select stock natural key
But I would select stock plus another table get company ID database
With much hierarchy may get query many many table involved database ID based
So far I seen ID based database outperform one natural key
But I seen natural key based database outperform ID based one far
This may I mainly seen big database much hierarchy
As database It seems ID based provided project ID user ID technical internal number otherwise database would mixed concept natural project number natural user ID technical ID ProjectUserBooleanAttribute
So question really compound key
UserID ProjectUserBooleanAttribute would null unique constraint unique index
So quality primary key need matter whether call primary key
Whether add technical ID look
It really change anything
The concept stay
In natural key concept would make field primary key
But would composite key ProjectId plus AttributeType
In technical ID concept would make primary key make field null add unique constraint make key called primary
Then either add technical ID primary key table without ID thus without primary key
It matter
If someone asks key give ID go without
It superfluous long needed table
When add id column table unavoidably add overhead managing table
But benefit table reference row table single id column instead old composite key
This make storage index smaller access faster table
Also make reference corresponding entity briefer one column apparent kind id
Note table use added id FK keep old composite FK column along id constraint value column value column row id reference

I reading candidate key composite key
I came know For composite key I referred link Thus candidate key composite key combination column qualify primary key
Then exact difference
Can please explain example
As I know candidate key unique key used primary key
necessarily used one
Composite key key two attribute uniquely identifies row
A key set column used uniquely identify row within table
Every table least one key
Let say identified possible key table
Each key candidate key
As examine key key may consist column
one column one column considered together uniquely identify row
The term composite key specifically refers key consists one column
In SQL decided one key selected treated equal key table
This key called primary key
Other key also declared table usually referred Unique Contsraints

In SQL allowed declare key column although would occasionally useful think table ever single row column representing configuration information As example table multiple key composite
Imagine appointment system client counsellor meet room particular time The candidate key table ClientID AppointmentTime CounsellorID AppointmentTime RoomID AppointmentTime
Any combination column could used uniquely identify row table composite key
Which one choose declare primary key depend probably interpretation main focus system
Are mainly concerned Room usage Clients Counsellors
In case select one declare primary key
We also hopefully declare key unique constraint
Or could decide use surrogate declare column using whatever facility available database
That could primary key
But still declare key table
A nominee primary key field known candidate key
Creating one primary key jointly known composite key
A candidate key unique key used primary key
Composite key key two attribute uniquely identifies row
A key set column used uniquely identify row within table
A candidate key column combination column used primary key ie candidate potential primary key A composite key definition two column could used identify row
Most commonly talking composite key question whether primary key surrogate key instead
On occassion may hear people refer composite key primary key ie unique row case hopefully way refer join key field instead cross join filtering row clause
Candidate key unique key Candidate primary key
Composition two column primary key consider Composite key

In constructed program using composite type
It sometimes called although latter term may also refer etc
The act constructing composite type known
A notion composite type datatype composes fixed set labeled
It called keyword used declaring short precisely
In difference default class Note class completely new already crude type For intent purpose form C virtually valid C valid semantics
A declaration consists list field type
The total storage required object sum storage requirement field plus internal
For example defines type
To create new variable type write integer component accessed component accessed well component
The structure contains four value four field may changed independently
Since writing repeatedly code becomes cumbersome unusual see statement C code provide convenient synonym
For example In code needed type defined using already part regular namespace type referred either simply
As another example Vector composite type us floating point data type could created A variable named composite type would declared Members would accessed using dot notation
For example would set component equal
Likewise color structure could created using In graphic usually must keep track position color vertex
One way would create composite type using previously created composite type Create variable type using format Assign value component like The primary use construction complex datatypes sometimes used create primitive
For example since requires two structs initial field field represented way code work correctly
constructed primitive composite type serve type constructing composite type

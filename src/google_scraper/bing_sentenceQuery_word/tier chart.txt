submitted I stumbled across study I baffled think UK extreme case country following suit
Also median salary look terrible
professional CS
Post comment
Anyone else notice half pie chart CS unemployment half includes Creative Arts Mass Communications Physical Science Engineering Technology total unemployment
How work
How work
This made unemployed infographic designer
Probably designer think make half pie chart little sliver
I think trying say CS grad unemployed Creative Arts grad etc etc
Not unemployed people CS grad
Now pie chart beyond
Yah I got
I ca stand people Horrible horrible infographic
Ok done whining honest Fucking pie chart work
And I wan na talk computer scientist motherfucker unemployed getting pissed valid point I think mean half unemployed graduate cdid comp sci
What actuially mean course infographic designer fuckwit
Woe take information infographics
Especially done service advertisement
Viz
footer linked image advertising company put together
Also note lack definition lack source
Basically I wager infographic complete horseshit
I believe
Yank
There hysteria air everyone must learn code seems major worth anything job market day computer science computer engineering
But truth everybody cut programming
And job located specific place
There probably lot people CS degree ca find job
Remember one heuristic life trend finally hit mainstream already peaked
Be careful judging salary elsewhere
Im saying political keep mind developed nation unlike US offer generous vacation healthcare pension benefit
Got offer Amazon UK
The salary roughly compared friend offer US
Stock option also laughable
Hate say I feel cheated I expected lower low
I applied position I wanted try living Europe also I worried visa
My final offer another company Bay Area includes day compared day UK side I know Amazon US offer though
The visa UK forbids take employment within month UK I ever leave company
So foreigner US much attractive
Quote immigration lawyer may subject cooling period Sponsorship Amazon end mean may permitted return UK Tier route
According people seems engineering position UK Europe general
Management position taken people whereas US tech company opposite
Also cheap workforce Eastern Europe drive salary
Edit Australia pay really well
At least salary Sydney par American side I scandinavian software developer degree year work experience
My yearly salary pretty much spot national median I complaining
I know compare US situation tax putting money pension mandatory payment rent food monthly expense household essential paying two loan I left EUR per month spend whatever I want
Combined total insurance year I remember right
That best way I know compare salary US v Europe
Okay another offer I got company Madison Wisconsin insurance After tax I around take home
Monthly expense around Madison cheap city leaf around spending
Basically save lot US
I realize fact I started research living expense income different country
Of course social benefit US bad
However young competent SE make US country
I applied company Sydney I thought benefit Australia really good I read blog entry Geez EPIC offer much salary
That actually fairly decent
Yeah I threw random number I interested company surprised matched
I guess I well test Yeah EPIC known paying pretty well absolutely everyone I talked say job terrible
Well I used leverage offer
They seem aware notoriety one question asked I turned offer
EUR Sounds good
Can I ask kind work
I work software development relatively big company country
Server backend web UI database design etc
I think I phrased wrongly
I meant technology use something else
p In work I use html javascript jQuery stuff Scala Java two different SQL dialect mostly
Random python scripting I get annoyed manual labor involved software development sometimes
Then different framework free internally developed etc The visa UK forbids take employment within month UK I ever leave company
This seems really strange kind visa
Tier General visa
According lawyer The may subject cooling period Sponsorship Amazon end mean may permitted return UK Tier route month
This applies first three year Amazon sponsor
I guess wording incorrect original posting year long period employment fresh grad
Ah I see thanks info
I wonder isnt much startup culture
Startups definitely significant source employment
Probably also person Quora pointed engineer much valued US Europe
I wonder would different started US transferred
They might cost living adjustment like I believe Microsoft people going Redmond WA SVC Silicon Valley Campus I think would steep
Of course guarantee transfer either due way business set legally demand US least make visa stuff easier I think visa different cap manager
Yeah company like Google MSFT use alternative people ca get
For company satellite office question
But I know change salary transfer
But request transfer wo get relocation support company
deleted Thank God someone sense first hand experience chime
This thread utterly depressing filled utter nonsense part
People even read linked article study properly person created awful infographic
Like I seriously sitting reading people go might switch major altogether thread
We need people pursuing field le
I read OP
But one explanation rate could people often take retail fast food etc
job thus considered
A CS grad might likely keep looking around skilled work
A better data point might employed field
The fact architecture education anywhere near medicine engineering resident something I never seen life
I confirm unemployment rate CS grad UK
I graduated could get CS job
Average CS salary near infographic I live work
I wonder big sample size
deleted I graduated could get CS job
You could find work anywhere UK want relocate waited find something area
I willing locate
I kind interview country one Surrey two Whales even one Scotland name
I put mixture recession starting e quite green
I specialised Games
Which I since told quite tough market
Luckily I employed developer day
The interview whale must cramped uncomfortable
Perhaps inability correctly spell country interviewing scuppered
That likely
Although I blaming auto correct phone
What freelance contracting
Even US lot devs included contract work
That pretty border agnostic unless person shopping local person contract engineer
That huge UK commercial business demand
I honest lot demand
The problem plenty high quality supply demand
I graduated could get CS job
Seriously
I signed agency week graduating I getting interview left right centre
Maybe starting look beginning recession contributed I signed several agency offered many many interview
Most even CompSci job I would find day interview case
I know recruiter back completely useless
Well wait minute
unemployed mean employed
And clear counting maybe working independent project something
The salary seem weird know
claim unemployed page newspaper
Note southern Europe even
You need fully read study article jump conclusion based nothing number data behind digit
It explicitly state vague term main reason high unemployment rate two key issue first racial hiring practice UK disproportionately higher unemployment rate among CS grad come visible minority background
Second issue something employer UK even Europe general keep reiterating school teaching proper tool skill set required position trying fill
Now like sort go even deeper issue
A lot CS grad pumped quite significantly higher enrolment rate visible minority opposed Russell Group institution leaf hiring bias large number school represent massive chunk graduate force
Here Canada massive demand CS CS related grad CE CIS CSA IT etc hardly uncommon employer hire without formal education
If got chop prove still expect find work decent wage well
Hell take pop sub ask around probably get job offer ffs
There still plenty work go around US well
It also important note need programmer likely going increase techonlogy continues progress new novel technique practice used industry
It keep growing good chance school may always hard time filling void competent grad
It getting busier
At end day also important note degree enough land job like case sure people getting medical field going higher employment lower graduate number almost always involves placement kind least experience employer love
With CS need active constantly working portfolio making known networking absolutely critical
These thing lot people miss I know fact lot school teach student
Shit I know fact lot CS program nothing glorified coding farm pump code monkey barely even touch critical thinking substantial theory fact
Even market demand willing take risk recent grad properly educated posse skill required wo last long someone else take spot
The problem demand
If demand SE high US Canada racial minority monkey would still able find job
That also explains salary job much lower US
I southern Europe demand SE temp work pay office clerk degree If demand SE high US Canada racial minority monkey would still able find job There likely quite bit hiring happening time lot firing end day unemployment number stay
Like I stated even demand easy find work properly educated skill get fired easily getting hired elsewhere much difficult
I southern Europe demand SE temp work pay office clerk degree Well fact southern Europe large part problem
You got general unemployment rate make thing relevant particular discussion pertains recent grad youth unemployment staggering literally almost half youth comprising unemployed try pin study disingenuous best appear really matter focus school
It demand CS SE grad demand grad general
I mean kind understand seeing immersed
I sorry come snide rude I Canada I even understand situation I sure I break
CS field booming practically everywhere else world competent field best option wait economy recover move demand
That could take one field study actually employing youth country
The point CS great US Canada everywhere else average job best
Good live bubble
Also moving job feasible seen restriction country place immigrant
The point CS great US Canada everywhere else average job best
That simply true
For example Australia notoriously impossible country emigrate waaaay worse CAN unless fill one occupation desperate fill case set doormat
Guess
One occupation happens SE Developer Programmer Analyst Programmer Systems Analyst et
al I think get picture
The demand high real
Shit even keep Europe make happy
Germany demand STEM related worker hardly excludes CS related field much like Australia field work basically open door anyone looking emigrate
Luckily EU citizen already need worry nonsense
seen restriction country place immigrant
Yes I actually quite aware
I know three people immigrated Philipines another Kuwait
Wan na know
They worked McDonald respective country got transferred McDonald franchisee city sponsored Canadian citizen
Wan na know common country I mentioned
We accept people certain skill open arm guess
Yup computer engineer programmer etc
list
Listen I telling move I know easy packing leaving town
Trust I really understand hard
My point cry sky falling may seem like mean everywhere else
It
There shortage developed world demand keep growing despite enrolment number increasing
Like I mentioned set option available ideal
Personally I still think made right choice focus wrong place wrong time
It economy industry field ultimately need understand
Last time checked Australia required already job lined Australian employer myriad thing basically already job experience money tiny chance able immigrate reason shortage first place
Germany still one best Europe still great
A HUGE number STEM graduate emigrate Germany every year mainly Switzerland
You missing point
While I entirely versed nuance emigration never talking point
I using example highlight job prospect simply near dim continuously proclaim
I even stated earlier I understand packing relocating hardly simple even reasonable option I said example
There demand plenty lot place
Some country pay le end day demand suffering largely due economy little field general beyond one many casualty crisis general
Earlier stated I live sphere problem seem missing far developed world concerned one bubble
Most everywhere else far greater job prospect field small isolated part big economic situation eventually turn around debate bearing conversation
Once point problem extremely isolated region reason far beyond seem attributing issue UK situation entirely different
At end day still demand majority place continue trend indicate
The place high demand CS US Can Aus
worldwide population hot spot scattered around world
My guess caused restrictive immigration policy country
So I say bubble
You really listening
This last time I going bother trying explain
If competent graduate practically STEM job especially CS related field getting citizenship three country listed
Here Canada immigrant compose roughly employed programmer sure totally impossible work absolutely allow anyone
I mean city tech job Toronto world multicultural city anything
I really know get information right may need job lined get Australia manner I stated competent field finding employer willing sponsor
Of course going take bit work make happen certainly overnight suggest hard make seem absurd
One big thing attracted CS option mobility
As far Europe concerned established fucking drain I bet know Microsoft alone going providing paid internship thanks agreement worked certain EU governmental body
Let leave job placement rolled Spain Portugal Greece Ireland Microsoft et al
Oh I bring Telecentre Europes plan help provide access job time period
This tip iceberg
Despite OP say infographic HUGE demand programmer UK much Boris Johnson submitted plan Home Office proposing special visa would streamline process international skilled worker fill massive gap education system provide proper training
You got thousand graduate disproportionate number ca code worth shit likely could even successfully complete Fizzbuzz test yes bad
So I sure getting information appears though person living bubble
Wait McDonald sponsor worker Canada
I know guy woefully underpopulated I idea problem
I sure exact process I pretty sure transferred part Foreign Worker Program long enough applied citizenship approved
Either way McDonalds made happen
There difficulty even US Canada
I idea person got statistic managed design terrible pie chart I take huge grain salt
I currently attending Russell Group university UK
The CS department employment rate graduate job done last year
I know three CS finalist personally least one job offer graduate position
For example technology department investment bank typical starting salary range varying proficiency
Most software house seem range though starting
There shortage job qualified software engineer
Just someone gave CS degree mean shit
I ca speak people degree earned given
The amount job seek people year commercial experience might need bite bullet willing hire graduate finally gain commercial exp
The amount job seek people year commercial experience might need bite bullet willing hire graduate finally gain commercial exp
It true lot asking year experience know toolset worked said technology throughout school I think say least year experience
A lot graduate I hear
I think employer might interpret professional experience knowing anything besides thought school case
I talking personally
Toy know still apply job even ask experience
Did get internship
Do take offense American picked degree Oxford I really think UK I think spectacular engineer
You guy Greece America Rome
You cultural hub world empire aqueduct marvelous road span known world
Your best vehicle built hand
Your best export actor
If want engineer software go America Germany
Do take offense American picked degree Oxford Sure With name like watched eh
massively ignorant comment like I believe edgy adolescent spouting nonsense behind comfort computer screen
I fairly certain secondary school education worst would taught importance UK engineering
It take astounding amount jingoism indoctrination hold view
Stuff see primary secondary school college foster balanced worldviews greater nuance
stuff
You sound like history course since graduate since high school
Or certainly pay attention
export actor really seal deal though I must say
Sounds like education ever received world came flick watch wow colour surprised way stereotype country
Look I Russian I reason love UK dislike matter relation never comfortable
However I shit UK I know history I majored
America much like Rome UK like Greece I say part Greece made first massive empire spread culture Diadochi tore apart manner phrase post condescending
Which whatever I take condescension guy talking sound like know talking
However certainly fit criterion
Congratulations
You found condescending account
The funny thing Oxon Adv
Dip
get British History
So whatever think teach UK school UK history clearly wrong
Reevaluate position
My time UK made MORE flamboyant American le
Plus British girl love American guy
That might real reason behind nationalistic attitude I think Plus British girl love American guy
That might real reason behind nationalistic attitude I think
It work way clapclap
Foreign tart liking foreign bloke shocker
More
Lol yeap little know I also hold PhD astrophysics
And wait
Oh right I see another frame wall
Good Heavens I forgot degree entirely many degree I
Let see say Mom
Hmm
I guess I Master
Look I studied Antiquity modern history Jesus Christ I could studied molecular biology still known British history

Congradulations
You get two one
Can please tell also sub extra point
I studied Antiquity Yep definitely Mom
If degree British history must know Brunel arguably greatest engineer history Charles Babbage considered father computer Frank Whittle invented Jet engine Robert Watt invented radar Alexander Graham Bell invented telephone John Harrison invented chronometer John Logie Baird invented television George Stephenson built world first railway Ralph Hooper invented vertical plane Chris Cockerill invented hovercraft
I could go
Britain richest engineering pedigree world
If degree British history He
I really think UK I think spectacular engineer
What fuck

We took mechanical engineering world
Isombard Kingdom Brunel George Louis Stephenson heard
Shit without Stephenson invention USA would grown fast
What Barnes Wallace invented bouncing bomb used Dambusters
Please tell heard Alan Turing
Moving century invented modern computer jet engine hovercraft television radar LCD display cat eye road many many others
When motorsport want better formula car rally car come UK best motorsport engineer world
Pretty much car UK designed built WRC rally car
Your best export actor
Actually engineering expertise
I swear must ignorant person ever
If want engineer software go America Germany
And even know Alan Turing
You find many leading game software house founded Brits moved America
I well last bit
I never heard American dev founded Brit
Admittedly I really looked one either
Do example
EDIT Not disagreeing curious
Cool blue arrow fucking question fuck
Ever heard Grand Theft Auto Red Dead Redemption Rockstar Games
Rockstar Games label founded British video game producer Sam Houser Dan Houser Terry Donovan Jamie King Gary Foreman
Did know
That pretty cool
There also fair case regarding classic British game developer Bullfrog Productions made lot great game eg
Theme Park Theme Hospital Dungeon Keeper largely absorbed company like EA
They took advice went America
Actually Rockstar North based Edinburgh Scotland
They make GTA game obviously including recent instalment GTAV
So go fuck
To fair Scots going part UK much longer
You really moron
Do try comment thing know anything
There independence referendum still likely actually succeed
Totally irrelevant
Yes I hope point Rockstar North still UK
Independent Scotland
That news
Interesting
Ha
American ignorance rear ugly head
So never heard entire goddamn Industrial Revolution
You know small thing started modern world produced greatest feat engineering ever
That thing led Britain still one major engineering country world due first successful industrialised society
The steam engine internal combustion engine almost every type bridge pretty much ever major engineering achievement past year either invented Britain invented using British expertise created people using machine technique first developed UK
There reason UK used known workshop world
That cool What guy done lately
Graphene remarkable material ever Skylon SSTO aircraft currently development UK contribution ISS ESA several advancement biomechanics robotics Metaflex light manipulating fabric yeah
Oh yeah UK also invented Sonar Radar
And jet engine
And television
And Tank
There modern thing I ca bothered continue speaking jingoistic fool
Also judging fact one previous comment compare legislation Nazism simply Nazis also implemented legislation show perhaps quite soundest mentality Radar jet engine developed simultaneously several different part world
The first patent describing jet powered airplane filed Frenchman
The first plane fly using jet engine German
The RAF stick mud came aircraft developed
Whittle work made possible using research done Griffith wrote book supposing jet engine theoretically possible
Whittle refined Griffith theory added went design patent jet engine built world first functional jet
The Germans however first build first jet engine
The Brits invented Germans intelligence actually
Hans von Ohain jet engine German jet built year later
Hon June August RAF
He credited single handedly inventing engine
Whittle engine developed year earlier Germany designer first operational
From early age Whittle demonstrated aptitude engineering interest flying
At first turned RAF determined join Royal Air Force overcame physical limitation accepted sent No
School Technical Training join No Squadron Cranwell Aircraft Apprentices
He taught theory aircraft engine gained practical experience engineering workshop
His academic practical ability Aircraft Apprentice earned place officer training course
He excelled study became accomplished pilot
While writing thesis formulated fundamental concept led creation turbojet engine taking patent design
His performance officer engineering course earned place course graduated First
Without support two retired RAF serviceman formed Ltd build engine assistance firm
Despite limited funding prototype created first ran
Official interest forthcoming following success contract placed develop engine continuing stress seriously affected Whittle health eventually resulting nervous breakdown
In Power Jets nationalised suffered nervous breakdown resigned board
I never made comment least I could find
I sure got
No one country create world wide web
But Jet engine tv tank
The fuck
Those least year old
Get piece machinery Mars try compare UK US engineering
Tim Inventor World Wide Web
A Brit Charles Babbage Analytical Difference Engines first computer
Mechanical rather electric still
Tommy Flowers Colossus first programmable usable electronic computer
Collosus ENIAC Even Standford say British invented computer You living past
Like Greeks
Hardly
We still forefront engineering today
See Skylon project discovery Graphene ThrustSSC fastest land vehicle world Falkirk Wheel etc etc
Britain still much forefront
That say Greeks bad engineer Romans better
Really arguing country kicked engineering across world big way still cutting edge inferior engineering prowess US
I assuming argument must almost wholly nationalistic
Infact idea one country inherently fallacious face
The US done amazing feat engineering UK engineer done equally amazing work many circumstance created technology
The computer example The world first supersonic airline hypertext protocol interface made internet booming big steam engine locomotive etc etc etc
engineered Brit
I hear bridge even fall apart anything
I could go excellent answer fellow country people posted instead I sum
YOU A DIPSHIT
LEARNZ UZ HISTORI
Why people voting
It absolutely correct
Some year ago full onset CS enrollment boom I graduated alongside kid absolutely unqualified work software engineer meaningful capacity senior remember understand basic binary tree worked much le sophisticated graph traversal might use thing versus say simple
Seniors still using bad practice habit developed even Intro Programming
Seniors mediocre poor GPAs relevant experience completed project kind
In short senior demonstrable capability potential
As employer would hire somebody like tune almost thousand dollar per week lower end
What value likely bring organization
Truth going see unemployment rate recent CS graduate increase rapidly next couple year market flooded recent grad incompetent chose study material seemed like safe lucrative bet actually interest aptitude anything meaningful
This sub populated bunch child want view world reinforced
For reason think getting degree mean get job
I surprised graduate coming UK boatload work US even benefit get
Maybe
It like whatever work visa offered get snapped couple day
I originally UK help I left I young know much stuff
I heard lot UK programmer moving Canada
I think probably boatload want come room
Canada Australia also attractive option
I sort wish sort preferential visa immigrant English speaking country UK Australia
They really able integrate faster society language cultural similarity make successful employee
Alas would certainly seen sort racism nothing like could get passed day age
Because people like living UK
De gustibus non est disputandum
I consider going back improved weather I could bring gun collection
Could kinda cool go live work come back I like show wife Lake District I grew
Did come immediately college working UK
What part country move
Like I said comment I came I old enough know much around age parent moved Canada first job school I moved US
even benefit get That week go long long way
This video
That
Do discount people freelance
So far one addressed following question I feel relevant credibility lack infograph What fall Medicine related part Medicine Dentistry Veterinary Science
Also defines Combined subject
Like combination
crap Do worry
If recent grad unemployed mean employed
So better least peer solid
deleted There much wrong comment I even know say
If people wo learn basic valuable make think learn get paid le
The way work basic get easier time
Besides really talking writing dead simple code algorithmic mathematical stuff
The research part scientific field getting complex time
While job high end job may le number I see getting easy enough could pay someone little make job
There might bunch competitor whoever hire command pretty good salary due hard work involved

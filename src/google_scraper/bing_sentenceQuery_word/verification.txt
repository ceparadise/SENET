In specifically particular kind based technique development system
The use formal method software hardware design motivated expectation engineering discipline performing appropriate mathematical analysis contribute reliability robustness design
Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Formal method used number level may undertaken program developed informally
This dubbed
This may option many case
may used produce program formal manner
For example proof property program may undertaken
This may appropriate system involving
may used undertake fully formal proof
This expensive practically worthwhile cost mistake extremely high critical part microprocessor design
Further information expanded
As style formal method may roughly classified follows Some practitioner believe formal method community overemphasized full formalization specification design
They contend expressiveness language involved well complexity system modelled make full formalization difficult expensive task
As alternative various formal method emphasize partial specification focused application proposed
Examples lightweight approach formal method include object modelling notation Denney synthesis aspect driven development CSK Tools
Formal method applied various point
Formal method may used give description system developed whatever level detail desired
This formal description used guide development activity see following section additionally used verify requirement system developed completely accurately specified
The need formal specification system noted year
In report presented formal notation describing programming language syntax later named renamed BNF
Backus also wrote formal description meaning syntactically valid ALGOL program completed time inclusion report
Therefore formal treatment semantics legal program included subsequent paper
It never appeared
Once formal specification produced specification may used guide concrete system process realized typically software also potentially hardware
For example Once formal specification developed specification may used basis property specification hopefully inference developed system
Sometimes motivation proving system obvious need correctness system desire understand system better
Consequently proof correctness produced style handwritten typeset using using level informality common proof
A good proof one readable understandable human reader
Critics approach point inherent natural language allows error undetected proof often subtle error present detail typically overlooked proof
Additionally work involved producing good proof requires high level mathematical sophistication expertise
In contrast increasing interest producing proof correctness system automated mean
Automated technique fall three general category Some automated theorem provers require guidance property interesting enough pursue others work without human intervention
Model checker quickly get bogged checking million uninteresting state given sufficiently abstract model
Proponents system argue result greater mathematical certainty proof since tedious detail algorithmically verified
The training required use system also le required produce good mathematical proof hand making technique accessible wider variety practitioner
Critics note system like make pronouncement truth yet give explanation truth
There also problem program aid verification unproven may reason doubt soundness produced result
Some modern model checking tool produce proof log detailing step proof making possible perform given suitable tool independent verification
The main feature abstract interpretation approach provides sound analysis
false negative returned
Moreover efficiently scalable tuning abstract domain representing property analyzed applying widening operator get fast convergence
Formal method applied different area hardware software including router Ethernet switch routing protocol security application
There several example used verify functionality hardware software used DCs
IBM used theorem prover AMD processor development process
Intel us method verify hardware firmware permanent software programmed memory

There several project NASA formal method applied Unmanned Aircraft System integration National Airspace System Airborne Coordinated Conflict Resolution Detection ACCoRD
used develop safety automatism various subway installed throughout world also Common Criteria certification development system model
Formal verification frequently used hardware hardware vendor IBM Intel AMD
There many area hardware Intel used FMs verify working product parameterized verification cache coherent protocol Intel Core processor execution engine validation using theorem proving symbolic evaluation optimization Intel architecture using HOL light theorem prover verification high performance gigabit Ethernet controller support PCI express protocol Intel advance management technology using Cadence
Similarly IBM used formal method verification power gate register functional verification IBM microprocessor
In formal method mathematical approach solving software hardware problem requirement specification design level
Formal method likely applied software system
Software safety assurance standard demand formal method highest level categorization
For sequential software example formal method include specification language used
In allowed mathematical specification testing exhaustive testing expected behaviour individual function
The specialization allowed system formally specified necessarily formally verified
For concurrent software system based see also allow executable software specification used build validate application behavior
Another approach formal method software development write specification form variation FOL directly execute logic though program
The language based DL example
There also work mapping version English another natural language automatically logic executing logic directly

In context hardware act disproving intended underlying system respect certain property using
Formal verification helpful proving correctness system internal memory software expressed source code
The verification system done providing abstract system correspondence mathematical model nature system otherwise known construction
Examples mathematical object often used model system formal semantics programming language
One approach formation consists systematically exhaustive exploration mathematical model possible also infinite model infinite set state effectively represented finitely using abstraction taking advantage symmetry
Usually consists exploring state transition model using smart abstraction technique consider whole group state single operation reduce computing time
Implementation technique include symbolic state space enumeration
The property verified often described LTL PSL Assertions SVA CTL
The great advantage model checking often fully automatic primary disadvantage general scale large system symbolic model typically limited hundred bit state explicit state enumeration requires state space explored relatively small
Another approach deductive verification
It consists generating system specification possibly annotation collection mathematical truth imply conformance system specification discharging obligation using either interactive theorem provers automatic theorem provers SMT solver
This approach disadvantage typically requires user understand detail system work correctly convey information verification system either form sequence theorem proved form specification system component
function procedure perhaps subcomponents loop data structure
Formal verification software program involves proving program satisfies formal specification behavior
Subareas formal verification include deductive verification see
A promising verification approach type function include least part function specification code establishes correctness specification
Fully featured dependently typed language support deductive verification special case
Another complementary approach efficient code produced specification series step
An example approach approach seen another form
These technique meaning verified property logically deduced semantics meaning guarantee
A sound technique yield result searched entire space possibility
An example unsound technique one search subset possibility instance integer certain number give result

Applying system thinking computing climate sustainability Sometime I drafted frequently asked question list
Here I wrote meaning term validation verification The term Verification Validation commonly used software engineering mean two different type analysis
The usual definition In word validation concerned checking system meet customer actual need verification concerned whether system
Verification help determine whether software high quality ensure system useful
The distinction two term largely role specification
Validation process checking whether specification capture customer need verification process checking software meet specification
Verification includes activity associated producing high quality software testing inspection design analysis specification analysis
It relatively objective process various product document expressed precisely enough subjective judgement needed order verify software
In contrast validation extremely subjective process
It involves making subjective assessment well proposed system address need
Validation includes activity requirement modelling prototyping user evaluation
In traditional phased software lifecycle verification often taken mean checking product phase satisfy requirement previous phase
Validation relegated begining ending project requirement analysis acceptance testing
This view common many software engineering textbook misguided
It assumes customer requirement captured completely start project requirement change software developed
In practice requirement change throughout project partly reaction project development new software make new thing possible
Therefore validation verification needed throughout lifecycle
Finally V V regarded coherent discipline Software V V system engineering discipline evaluates software system context relative system element hardware user software
Software Verification Validation Its Role Computer Assurance Its Relationship Software Project Management Standards Dolores Wallace Roger Fujii NIST Special Publication Having thus carefully distinguished two term advice V V practitioner forget distinction think instead V V toolbox provides wide range tool asking different kind question software
And master use tool figure use
Here one attempt visualize space tool toolbox A range V V technique
Note modeling model checking refer building analyzing abstracted model software behaviour different kind beast scientific model used computational science For climate model definition focus specification make much sense detailed specification climate model built iterative refinement like agile software development
But matter toolbox approach still work mean tool applied little differently
An appropriate toolbox climate modeling look little different picture tool appropriate control system application software etc missing picture particular simulation software
I draw better picture I finished analyzing data field study practice used climate lab
Many different V V tool climate modelling lab room adding tool toolbox sharpening existing tool subject current research
But question best must proceed detailed analysis current practice effective
There seem plenty wandering space claiming model insufficiently verified validated
And people like pontificate climate modeler ought differently
But anyone pontificate way unable give detailed account V V technique climate modeller currently use blowing smoke
If know toolbox already really make constructive comment missing

conducted development simulation model ultimate goal producing accurate credible model
Simulation model increasingly used solve problem aid
The developer user model decision maker using information obtained result model individual affected decision based model rightly concerned whether model result correct
This concern addressed verification validation simulation model
Simulation model approximate imitation system never exactly imitate system
Due model verified validated degree needed model intended purpose application
The verification validation simulation model start functional specification documented initial model development completed
Verification validation iterative process take place throughout development model
In context computer simulation model process confirming correctly implemented respect conceptual model match specification assumption deemed acceptable given purpose application
During verification model tested find fix error implementation model
Various process technique used assure model match specification assumption respect model concept
The objective model verification ensure implementation model correct
There many technique utilized verify model
Including limited model checked expert making logic flow diagram include logically possible action examining model output reasonableness variety setting input parameter using interactive debugger
Many software engineering technique used applicable simulation model verification
Validation check accuracy model representation real system
Model validation defined mean substantiation computerized model within domain applicability posse satisfactory range accuracy consistent intended application model
A model built specific purpose set objective validity determined purpose
There many approach used validate computer model
The approach range subjective review objective statistical test
One approach commonly used model builder determine validity model series test
Naylor Finger formulated approach model validation widely followed Step
Build model high face validity
Step
Validate model assumption
Step
Compare model transformation corresponding transformation real system
A model appears reasonable imitation system people knowledgeable real world system
Face validity tested user people knowledgeable system examine model output reasonableness process identify deficiency
An added advantage user involved validation model credibility user user confidence model increase
Sensitivity model input also used judge face validity
For example simulation fast food restaurant drive run twice customer arrival rate per hour per hour model output average wait time maximum number customer waiting would expected increase arrival rate
Assumptions made model generally fall two category structural assumption system work data assumption
Assumptions made system operates physically arranged structural assumption
For example number server fast food drive lane one utilized
Do server work parallel customer completes transaction visiting single server one server take order handle payment prepares serf order
Many structural problem model come poor incorrect assumption
If possible working actual system closely observed understand operates
The system structure operation also verified user actual system
There must sufficient amount appropriate data available build conceptual model validate model
Lack appropriate data often reason attempt validate model fail
Data verified come reliable source
A typical error assuming inappropriate statistical distribution data
The assumed statistical model tested using goodness fit test technique
Examples goodness fit test
Any outlier data checked
The model viewed transformation test
The validation test consists comparing output system consideration model output set input condition
Data recorded observing system must available order perform test
The model output primary interest used measure performance
For example system consideration fast food drive input model customer arrival time output measure performance average customer time line actual arrival time time spent line customer drive would recorded
The model would run actual arrival time model average time line would compared actual average time spent line using one test
using used basis accept model valid reject invalid
The hypothesis tested versus The test conducted given sample size level significance α
To perform test number statistically independent run model conducted average expected value E Y variable interest produced
Then test statistic computed given α E Y observed value system μ If reject H model need adjustment
There two type error occur using hypothesis testing rejecting valid model called type I error model builder risk accepting invalid model called Type II error β model user risk
The level significance α equal probability type I error
If α small rejecting null hypothesis strong conclusion
For example α null hypothesis rejected probability rejecting model valid
Decreasing probability type II error important
The probability correctly detecting invalid model β
The probability type II error dependent sample size actual difference sample value observed value
Increasing sample size decrease risk type II error
A statistical technique amount model accuracy specified range recently developed
The technique us hypothesis testing accept model difference model variable interest system variable interest within specified range accuracy
A requirement system data model data approximately
The statistic used technique
If mean model μ mean system μ difference model system D μ μ
The hypothesis tested D within acceptable range accuracy
Let L lower limit accuracy U upper limit accuracy
Then versus tested
The operating characteristic OC curve probability null hypothesis accepted true
The OC curve characterizes probability type I II error
Risk curve model builder risk model user developed OC curve
Comparing curve fixed sample size tradeoff model builder risk model user risk seen easily risk curve
If model builder risk model user risk upper lower limit range accuracy specified sample size needed calculated
Confidence interval used evaluate model close enough system variable interest
The difference known model value μ system value μ checked see le value small enough model valid respect variable interest
The value denoted symbol ε
To perform test number statistically independent run model conducted mean expected value E Y μ simulation output variable interest Y standard deviation produced
A confidence level selected
An interval b constructed critical value given level significance degree freedom
If statistical assumption satisfied insufficient data system graphical comparison model output system output used make subjective decision however objective test preferable

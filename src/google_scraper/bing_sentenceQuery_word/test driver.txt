See Valiant research statement I think good summary The majority computational problem including explicit mathematical characterization problem fall within category question best compute little understood
These core problem remain fundamental mathematical challenge computer science
They related foundational question quantum physic notably polynomial time version Turing hypothesis
In major conceptual challenge remain controlling programming large parallel system whether multicore device chip highly distributed design algorithm device portable run efficiently wide class architectural design widely varying performance characteristic
A fundamental question characterize computational building block necessary cognition
A specific challenge build success machine learning cover broader issue intelligence
This requires particular reconciliation two contradictory characteristic apparent logical nature reasoning statistical nature learning
In widely open problem remains weak model computation cortex apparently offer support cognitive computation
broad set primitive operation computed robustly significant scale even weak model
A challenge different direction understanding Darwinian evolution evolve number generation population size apparently available earth
Darwin notion variation selection computational notion offer direct challenge quantitative analysis method computer science

Computer Science Fundamentals Acccelerated hour course designed year old student
It taught week school club integrated unit longer technology class used intro computer science class
Students learn create computer program help learn collaborate others develop skill persist difficult task
They study programming concept computational thinking digital citizenship develop interactive game story share
The course teach foundational concept programming using drag drop block rather programming language JavaScript Python
Blocks easier way get started many top Universities today begin class block based programming
The Accelerated Course combine concept taught accelerated fashion designed older student
All lesson align relevant computer science standard well
They additionally reinforce concept skill taught subject area integrating national standard

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I studying computer science absolutely flummoxed
The definition I find discrete data countable continuous uncountable
Examples given stating integer discrete real number continuous
Rationals state controversial
I understand topic fall within category discrete mathematics I get
Especially set theory universal set real number
How I continuous realm value consider structure discrete
Considering integer real belong unlimited realm possibility I fail see either one considered countable infinite
How would define discrete mathematics would someone recognize discrete continuous mathematics faced
My knowledge mathematics discrete limited please explain would year old
The difference countable uncountable set well formalized never doubt
These two different size infinity
You read page information countable uncountable But I think one intuition really helpful also linking computer science fact countable set set whose element finitely describable
For instance integer written piece paper set integer countable
This make integer manageable computer since completely describe integer finite way always pas computer finite sequence
This also real countable might need write decimal infinite sequence
This make continuous mathematics automatic treatment computer
Of course schematic detailed intuition important
It possible formally prove every element E contains finite amount information E countable
Following intuition rational countable rational r given two integer b
This prevent rational important tool analysis real approached rational arbitrarily close say Q dense R
But computer algorithm dealing arbitrary number actually deal rational number
As classification math discrete continuous frontier really everything interacts everything else almost impossible give sound definition
A big part subjective
At best flavour field mostly discrete like graph theory continuous analysis case might need also consider side order get good understanding like using probability theory graph theory
Admittedly distinction always clear cut
Various field mathematics tend overlap much difficult say algebra topology whatever
The subconscious distinction largely develops technique one us feel
For instance said analysis art taking limit
The flavor often simple finite case
Yes
Apply limit theorem
Can take limit limit
No
Okay need control error term
Probability PDE also fall category thing obvious reason lot derivative measure theory space
Ironically thing modern continuous Ã priori
Discrete math hand test different way
Combinatorics great example often need little background understand question underlying technique sophisticated require experience
You might consider finite group theory discrete math could reasonable considering permutation group much analysis done locally compact Abelian Hausdorff group
Sieve argument kind used proof twin prime conjecture also combinatorial
You worry much distinction
As Feynman pointed knowing name something bring closer understanding
Dabble learn eventually able say feel like typical argument discrete math
I mean know difference fruit vegetable
There grey area banana berry tomato fruit someone hand something juicy sweet crisp delicious say fruit
even though one told
According dictionary discrete mean constituting separate entity part I think usage meant talk discrete mathematics
The best way know discrete mathematics probably study text paper discrete mathematics
Some people like discrete mathematics continuous mathematics others mindset suited towards continuous mathematics people different taste interest
On hand different area mathematics intimately related boundary discipline created artificially
You might want read article available online Laszlo Lovasz titled Discrete continuous two side
To rather indiscrete different area science mathematics let different aspect everyday life use word contradictory way
Look word dictionary chance see dozen meaning
Furthermore anytime told X mean Y suspend belief Almost certainly statement false
Different word exist different meaning nuance
They may coincide referent truth value time still different meaning
Different word get different formal definition different part science mathematics
For example word like significance confidence different meaning different paper machine learning data mining
Different theory set mean word set different meaning theory
The functional idea continuity concern mapping domain range constraint
continuous range two value range contains value range
continuous function two value domain closer delta mapping intervening value continuous domain lie range
Considering sqr rational rational work fine rational two rational etc
Of course sqrt rational rational problem irrational root second problem imaginary root negative part domain complex range needed
So problem rational countable continuous
Discrete mean individual separate distinguishable implying discontinuous continuous integer discrete sense even though countable sense use count
In fact formal definition countable anything count integer sense defining bijective function integer set
In computer science machine learning data mining etc
What important treat attribute
A data mining text may actually distinguish categorical discrete enumerated nominal treat alike thing without idea thing
But enumeration also implies ordering value need able counted enumerated integer numbered
However purpose may taxonomy defined showing relationship discrete item like card suit colour face value number card v card etc
Similarly purpose ordering needed range integer suit card game fuzzy term like small medium large etc
From computer science perspective difference real rational ca represent arbitrary real tend use decimal representation sometimes rational representation surd representation really representation including pi e phi constant want try represent
Thus idea count map nicely idea discrete one sense practice rational real wo regarded discrete discrete would normally mean whole number integer
This reflects another idea discrete meaning whole entire denying possibility subdividing
This come back functional idea continuity thing equivalently able subdivide interval concept fraction rational
Of course real complex number much later invention lie outside intuitive everyday framework ca directly represented full range computer science
In fact stated definition like useful assumption axiom computer science
To address two question raised Discrete set consist entirely
set one find small enough neighborhood one point set contained intuition point spread apart minimum distance point
Discrete mathematics done using method typically using integer
combinatorics elementary number theory finite subset rational
discrete probability theory
No rational discrete set even though countably infinite
This rational isolated point always find nearby rational number close like
This called Archimedean property rational see asking tiny fraction say I find smaller one
Sure
So neighborhood put around rational point could find another rational within
However collection rational number discrete since finitely many rational minimum distance two rational set one find interval smaller guarantee one rational given time
This mean finite set rational isolated set therefore discrete
Note reason discrete probability use rational still considered discrete set event considered finite ever calling upon finite number rational describe

In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

Deb Shinder begin series column subject cybercrime law enforcement post profiling criminal figuring type crime likely commit
By Those know law enforcement tell criminal profiling art science
It generalization knowing type people generally commit specific type criminal offense helpful catching prosecuting perpetrator specific crime
That information also useful protecting digital asset cybercriminals
As I noted book criminal profile psychological assessment made without knowing identity criminal
It includes personality characteristic even include physical characteristic
Fitting profile mean person committed crime profiling help narrow field suspect may help exclude person suspicion
Profilers use statistical data inductive profiling common sense testing hypothesis deductive profiling formulate profile
Profiling one many tool used investigation
What profiling tell u typical cybercriminal person us computer network commit crime
There always exception cybercriminals display following characteristic That still leaf u broad description use last characteristic narrow
This especially important since motive generally considered important element building criminal case along mean opportunity
Let look common motivating factor Cybercriminals use computer network tool crime incidentally crime
Many crime committed cybercriminals could committed without using computer network
For example terroristic threat could made telephone via snail mail embezzler could steal company money safe con artist come door talk elderly individual saving person
Even crime seem unique computer age usually counterpart era
Unauthorized access computer technically different different mindset motif intent unauthorized access vehicle home business office
burglary defacing company web site similar many way painting graffiti company front door
Computer network done criminal thing done legitimate computer user made job easier convenient
Some cybercriminals use Internet find victim
This includes scam artist serial killer everything
Police often thwart type crime trap criminal setting sting operation masquerade type victim appeal criminal
We think relation crime child pornography pedophilia basic premise setting honeypot network attract bad guy
In case criminal use network keeping record related crime drug dealer prostitute list client use technology communicate potential customer
Amazingly significant number criminal use corporate laptop email account
This situation whereby IT professional may stumble across evidence crime inadvertently including crime related computer network
All cybercriminals definitely created equal
They range downloads illegal song without really realizing crime desperate white collar worker dire financial strait downloads company secret sell competitor pay family medical bill knowing full well wrong cold hearted sociopath us network get whatever want whenever want belief thing right wrong
White collar crime large category police agency entire investigative division devoted exclusively
White collar criminal often use computer commit offense easy manipulate electronic database misappropriate money thing value
Some white collar criminal highly organized meticulous detail stealing limited amount one source may go year decade without caught
Others impulse instance may angry bad evaluation passed promotion strike back company taking money believe deserve
Signs possible white collar criminal include There may reason symptom
Some older worker today unstable banking climate younger one trust bank may afraid collapse economic system thus deal cash much possible
Many folk legitimate large income afraid invest stock market investment split money among different bank keep covered FDIC
This
A dilemma IT personnel white collar criminal often upper management position company
If discover evidence bos stealing company blowing whistle could put job jeopardy
In future installment column discus uncover indication criminal activity course IT job report preserve evidence expect aftermath

Sketchy Joe bus stop pacing back forth looking watch
A jewelry store window display directly behind bus kiosk last bus night come gone
A police officer walk asks Joe lean kiosk wall
She pat search pocket finding small pocket knife one pocket baggie another
The baggie contains two rock crack cocaine officer arrest Sketchy Joe
Is arrest legitimate
To answer understand level contact authority level vest police assert control suspect
One level casual encounter authority detain search exists
Another probable cause officer full authority detain question search evidence possibly make arrest
Somewhere causal encounter probable cause reasonable suspicion
If exists officer detain question pat safety
In police authority person person right continue way
This happens someone meet officer store restaurant walking street
exists officer cause believe crime occurred occur person posse evidence crime
Then officer detain question full search weapon possibly make arrest
lesser threshold probable cause
If exists officer detain search weapon question person
If questioning person answer reasonable longer exists reasonable suspicion officer let person go
The legal standard determine reasonable suspicion exists first articulated Supreme Court whether officer reasonably belief circumstance criminal activity afoot person connected activity
In Terry case court looking whether police could pat suspect weapon even though probable cause exist
Terry acting peculiarly front store officer stopped questioned
He suspected Terry weapon patted removed Terry coat found gun charged illegal possession
The court also held knowledge absolute rather steeped probability
If random person flees upon seeing officer automatically reason suspect criminal activity
However person standing known drug corner dressed loose fitting clothes young run reasonable suspect criminal activity
However person khaki polo shirt look like Bible religious tract hand run reasonable suspect criminal activity
The Fourth Amendment guarantee everyone right proceed without unreasonable search person house paper effect
But operative word unreasonable search
The idea person merely walking street happens walk front jewelry store expect searched
However like friend Sketchy Joe pacing looking store window acting nervous reasonable prudent officer able detain inquire acting suspicious
Get FREE access day create account
But officer want check Joe weapon
After Terry case officer perform Sketchy Joe officer reasonably belief carrying weapon
This based person demeanor type clothing bulge clothing circumstance might make reasonable prudent officer believe weapon present
If Joe wearing pant shirt overcoat nervously touching jacket gun might exists reasonable suspicion pat weapon
However Joe wearing Speedo
All nervous demeanor world ca make officer think hidden weapon exists
So officer detain ask question ultimately must let go without search answer pan
Also contraband found pat weapon
Let say patted Sketchy Joe find weapon still found baggie rock cocaine
The court held officer performing valid pat weapon find something clearly contraband create probable cause full search arrest possession illegal substance
When police encounter citizen circumstance encounter determine authority officer person
See following table Reasonable suspicion based totality circumstance allows officer detain question pat safety officer
If contraband found officer probable cause make arrest charge illegal possession

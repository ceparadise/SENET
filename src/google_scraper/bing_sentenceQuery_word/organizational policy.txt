A defines goal element organization computer system
The definition highly formal informal
Security policy enforced organizational policy security mechanism
A technical implementation defines whether computer system
These formal policy categorized core security principle Confidentiality Integrity Availability
For example whereas
If system regarded set transition operation change system state seen statement partition state authorized unauthorized one
Given simple definition one define one start authorized state never enter unauthorized state
To represent concrete policy especially automated enforcement language representation needed
There exist lot application specific language closely coupled security mechanism enforce policy application

instructor feedback information stored accessed remotely company using service Customers Customers know personal information exposed public access therefore protect remotely accessed Svantesson Clarke
They understand application measure protect information make sure risk subjected
Customers mandate respect right others make sure action harmful anyone despite Svantesson Clarke
Company It ensure customer personal information exposed public access use implementing information protection technique
The company treat every information way understand customer information risked benefit performance
A company duty eliminate harmful practice exposing customer information remote access ensure everyone secure harmed business
Cloud provider They ensure platform used host cloud secure free information data breach
They develop cloud offer service without form discrimination ensure consequence equally distributed among user Pearson
The service provide expose anyone harm secure attacker utilize personal information benefit Pearson
Other user cloud They aware information security issue related remote sharing take initiative protect personal information
They need understand service offered treated like colleague Svantesson Clarke
They perform activity harmful user cloud
The dilemma explores privacy issue promoted cloud computing implemented
Considering ethical concern associated practice possible measure need applied
If issue handled future enhancement privacy would difficult
The dilemma give clear image privacy concern trigger necessary action
The three principle evaluate issue effectively hence choice
Confidentiality ensures personal information access authorized person
Justice promotes application principle rule promote privacy
ensures people considered implementing certain strategy
The three principle relation ethical issue
The research based idea privacy enhanced availed everyone
The matrix action subjected qualitative research ensure adequate information gathered
Data acquired action evaluation done applying
The analysis thorough ensure gap left

The ubiquity password fact present age
Authentication usually executed using combination user name password Vu Proctor Tai Cook

Thus password often major barrier potential attacker information
Knowing password allows attacker impersonate person online setting access sensitive data intended person
As society becomes increasingly dependent password security also becomes vulnerable password becoming compromised
Previous work shown user given option tend create simple password Yan Summers Bosworth Leyden
However simple password especially vulnerable attacker Yan Vu Proctor Tai Cook

Therefore many group organization develop password policy impose restriction password user may create password used
A policy may increase security Polstra Summers Bosworth Vu Proctor Tai Cook
Kuo Romanosky Cranor
A large portion password policy usually related creation password
For example password creation policy may require password least six character long contain least one numeric character
There however several facet password lifecycle password policy relevant Weirich
In design password policy crucial human factor considered addition technical factor
While password policy may specify encryption used password overly complex password may written paper user fail memorize Summers Bosworth
Likewise many password policy specify user may share password circumstance administrator contacted
There many organization using password security unified context password policy may understood compared
Such unified context would enable creation better password policy better understanding password policy Summers Bosworth
Passwords common authentication accessing computer system file data network
But really secure
According Wakefield SANS Institute indicates weak nonexistent password among top critical computer vulnerability home business
A compromised password opportunity someone explore file account even obtain administrative privilege undetected
Federal regulation mandate security confidential client information
The rising threat litigation prompting organization seriously evaluate computer security measure
Creating impenetrable password reasonable measure enhance system security
Security breach put firm risk litigation failing protect confidential information also lead financial loss Wakefield
The technology developed prevent unauthorized person gaining entry protected system file
The process converting data contained message secret code prior transmission via public telecommunication channel make content incomprehensible authorized recipient
A structure role responsibility functioning accomplish predetermined objective
An authorized word sequence character user must enter input order log computer system gain access desired resource
A code used automated system identify authorized user
A security procedure designed verify authorization code entered user gain access network system valid
A deliberate plan action guide decision achieve rational outcome
The privilege using computer system online resource usually controlled issuance access code authorized user

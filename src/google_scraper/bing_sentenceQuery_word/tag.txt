In simplest term study information data manipulated algorithm solve problem mostly theory also practice
Computer science study computer strictly require use computer
Data algorithm possible compute using pen paper make computer science misnomer
Computer science akin mathematics prefer use term informatics instead
Computer science often get conflated three field related exactly All said people nowadays use computer science term field involves programming data analysis manipulation interaction software hardware
In word computer science many concentration If plan studying computer science know
Schools even agree computer science entail let alone agree discipline belong computer science heading
Here list common type computer science may encounter one specializes
As see computer science one broadest field today In order graduate college university computer science degree study likely include minimum I would tell somebody give computer science simply right trait characteristic
If want pursue mean pursue
Hard work perseverance overcome kind shortcoming field
A degree cost minimum four year life
Know getting minimize chance wasting precious year
Someone good fit computer science Problem solving core skill computer scientist software engineer information technologist
If naturally curious feel urge figure thing find joy computer science career guaranteed
Furthermore computer science one fastest advancing field world today
If desire keep new language new library new application etc
may soon overwhelmed unless stick legacy field
Computer science also highly creative
You literally creating code scratch unlike writer painter musician
You think outside box practice
need determination make side time time
If none applies
If computer science intrigue think take good fit congratulation
You waiting ahead
There one thing need know want In beginning taste explore many different area computer science
You might surprised one like best certain one fun actually
But know one focus become master
Dabbling many area rarely make far career
On hand specialized expert take far
Required field marked Great

If introduced HTML probably know HTML tag
A special word angle bracket make readable way organize thing web page document
Here example HTML tag So tag
They usually come opening closing pair like one shown example insert tag tag
A lot like regular HTML tag except word mean need closing tag unless using XHTML
The thing HTML tag define contain actual data site whereas meta tag defines something data call typically
Imagine Christmas want keep track present bought everybody want write package
You could maintain inventory tag package
Well kind meta tag like
It bit information web page meant organizing need without visible receiver
Like Metadata like text hidden web page user ca see though still
Why
Web page use meta tag search engine robot web crawler automatic thing scan web page gather critical information needed find organize
Here common example useful meta tag inserted within open closed marker head section Notice meta tag come open closed pair
The meta information simply contained within one open angle bracket beginning one closed angle bracket end
Refer green arrow image
As see meta tag always us left side equal sign listing name label right side listing associated value
In example meta tag paired term meta tag paired word
It easy way associate label something
This particular meta tag list keywords associated web page
Now search engine scan page find keywords lesson even people visiting page ca see word
So somebody search lesson good chance see page listed search result
Nifty huh
Would like see example meta tag
We looked one keywords also meta tag web page site last page version among others
All meta tag go header head section body body section
Here example three mentioned As see within head section meta name paired content author name case Sue
The meta information site description revision detail come right followed closing tag
We also tricky thing meta tag
We tell web page somewhere else handy As see head section used meta tag set three second
After three second user browser redirect URL specified
We even use meta tag keep track user visit web page save computer
That way user visit page pick right left Get FREE access day create account
When user visit page meta tag set cookie user name using simplicity expire certain future date
We mention super common tag technically meta tag
Meta tag optional whereas tag considered required according World Wide Web Consortium make sure kind standard
But bear mind standard guideline page follow although good idea try
The obvious example special tag tag located within head section
Here
Notice closing tag
That
You learned need know start using meta tag
Shall quickly review learned today
HTML us tag group information meta tag special kind tag list information page
This information want share want everybody see
Regular tag usually come open closed pair head meta tag unless using XHTML another lesson
Meta tag use associate label bit information
Some kind meta tag site site web page information
Some neat trick meta tag include site visitor adding
That pretty much
With meta tag like Christmas every day hidden tag every package

This kind help describe item allows found browsing searching
Tags generally chosen informally personally item creator viewer depending system although may also chosen
Tagging popularized associated important feature many Web service
It also part
People use tag aid mark ownership note indicate
Tags may take form word image identifying mark
An analogous example tag physical world object tagging
People using textual object long computer
Computer based made use keywords rapid way exploring record
Tagging gained popularity due growth website
These site allow user create manage label tag categorize content using simple keywords
Websites include tag often display collection tag desktop application
On website aggregate tag user individual user tag useful larger community website user
Tagging system sometimes classified two kind
created authorized group designer sometimes form whereas taxonomy called created user
This definition top bottom confused distinction one correct way classify item versus multiple way classify item structure taxonomy may either hierarchical combination
Some researcher application experimented combining hierarchical tagging aid information retrieval
Others combining tagging including large library catalog
When tag taxonomy property constitute
Metadata tag described article confused use word tag software refer automatically generated example latter
The use keywords part identification classification system long predates computer
device notably permitted classification sorting multiple criterion already use prior twentieth century used library since
In late early offered companion software program called could automatically build table called Emacs could use jump function definition
This use word tag refer metadata tag early use word tag software refer
early website deployed keyword tag way publisher help user find content
In early day used tell web page keywords visible web page modifiable user
In collaborative portal A Description Equator Some ØtherLands produced X Germany used term guest author Upload page
In The Equator term described aid user
However user defined singular share point
In website provided way user add tag bookmark way help find later Delicious also provided browseable aggregated view bookmark user featuring particular tag
Within couple year website allowed user add text tag picture constructing flexible easy metadata made picture highly searchable
The success Flickr influence Delicious popularized concept implemented tagging
In standard provided category element inserting subject category proposed tag
Many system web allow author add tag post along instead placing post predetermined category
For example post may display tagged
Each tag usually leading index page listing post associated tag
The blog may sidebar listing tag use blog tag leading index page
To reclassify post author edits list tag
All connection post automatically tracked updated blog software need relocate page within complex hierarchy category
Some feature tagging system email tagging bookmark tagging audio tagging photo tagging various application
Some application display collection tag
There various system applying tag file computer
In operating system allowed user assign multiple arbitrary tag file folder ever since released time OpenMeta standard provided similar tagging functionality macOS
Several implement tag available including
allows user set tag document kind picture file
file tagging standard include XMP embedding metadata popular image video document file format without breaking readability application support XMP
XMP largely supersedes earlier
standard specifies image audio used including metadata tag
application tagging file insert tag
An keyword adopted event conference participant use web publication blog entry photo event presentation slide
Search engine index make relevant material related event searchable uniform way
In case tag part
A researcher may work large collection item
press quote bibliography image digital form
If wish associate small number theme
chapter book overall subject group tag theme attached item larger collection
In way freeform allows author manage would otherwise unwieldy amount information
A us special define extra information tag making easier meaningful interpretation computer program
Triple tag comprise three part value
For example tag geographical coordinate whose value
This triple structure similar model information
The triple tag format first devised geolicious November map bookmark gained wider acceptance adoption Mappr GeoBloggers map photo
In January Aaron Straup Cope Flickr introduced term alternative name triple tag adding question answer purpose syntax use
Specialized metadata geographical identification known machine tag also used purpose identifying photo taken specific event naming specie using
A hashtag kind metadata tag marked prefix sometimes known hash symbol
This form tagging used
A type describes defines aspect piece information
Knowledge tag traditional type capture knowledge form description categorization classification comment note annotation reference collected tag profile kind
These tag profile reference information resource resides distributed often heterogeneous storage repository
Knowledge tag part discipline leverage methodology user capture insight expertise attribute dependency relationship associated data resource
Different kind knowledge captured knowledge tag including factual knowledge found book data conceptual knowledge found perspective concept expectational knowledge needed make judgment hypothesis methodological knowledge derived reasoning strategy
These form often exist outside data derived personal experience insight expertise
Knowledge tag considered expansion information add additional value context meaning information
Knowledge tag valuable preserving organizational intelligence often lost due sharing knowledge stored mind individual typically isolated unharnessed organization connecting knowledge often lost disconnected information resource
In typical tagging system explicit information meaning tag user apply new tag item easily applying older tag
Hierarchical classification system slow change rooted culture era created contrast flexibility tagging allows user classify collection item way find useful personalized variety term present challenge searching browsing
When user freely choose tag creating opposed selecting term resulting metadata include tag used different meaning multiple tag concept may lead inappropriate connection item inefficient search information subject
For example tag orange may refer item related version may tagged Linux kernel Penguin software variety term
Users also choose tag different word singular plural contribute navigation difficulty system include tag searching browsing
folksonomies address problem tagging user tagging system tend notice current use tag term within system thus use existing tag order easily form connection related item
In way folksonomies may collectively develop partial set tagging convention
Despite apparent lack control research shown simple form shared vocabulary emerges social bookmarking system
Collaborative tagging exhibit form dynamic dynamic
Thus even central controlled vocabulary constrains action individual user distribution tag converges time stable distribution
Once stable distribution form simple vocabulary extracted examining form different tag
In addition research suggested easier algorithm learn tag semantics user tag verbosely annotate resource wealth freely associated descriptive keywords
Tagging system open public also open tag spam people apply excessive number tag unrelated tag item video order attract viewer
This abuse mitigated using human statistical identification spam item
The number tag allowed may also limited reduce spam
Some tagging system provide single enter tag able string must used
Two popular separator
To enable use separator tag system may allow separator
Systems avoid use separator allowing one tag added input time although make adding multiple tag
A syntax use within use us value tag indicate page act tag current context

A SC show breakdown system lowest manageable level
They used arrange program module tree
Each module represented box contains module name
The tree structure visualizes relationship module
A structure chart tool constructed square representing different module line connect
The line represent connection ownership activity subactivities used
In structure chart according Wolber used specify design architecture
As design tool aid programmer dividing conquering large software problem recursively breaking problem part small enough understood human brain
The process called
Programmers use structure chart build program manner similar architect us blueprint build house
In design stage chart drawn used way client various software designer communicate
During actual building program implementation chart continually referred
A structure chart depicts A structure chart also used associated element comprise run stream thread
It often developed representation allowable
The representation must describe breakdown lowest manageable level
An accurate complete structure chart key determination configuration item CI visual representation configuration system internal interface among CIs
During configuration control process structure chart used identify CIs associated artifact proposed change may impact
According Wolber structure chart developed starting creating structure place root tree form structure chart
The next step conceptualize main must performed program solve problem
Next programmer focus individually conceptualizes broken even smaller task
Eventually program broken point leaf tree represent simple method coded program statement
In practice see figure first checked Structure Chart developed already
If expert need review ensure represents current structure update chart

A type represents process showing step box various kind order connecting arrow
This diagrammatic representation illustrates solution model given
Flowcharts used analyzing designing documenting managing process program various field
Flowcharts used designing documenting simple process program
Like type diagram help visualize going thereby help understand process perhaps also find flaw bottleneck feature within
There many different type flowchart type repertoire box notational convention
The two common type box flowchart A flowchart described page divided different describing control different organizational unit
A symbol appearing particular lane within control organizational unit
This technique allows author locate responsibility performing action making decision correctly showing responsibility organizational unit different part single process
Flowcharts depict certain aspect process usually complemented type diagram
For instance defined flowchart one seven basic tool quality control next
Similarly standard notation used software development type flowchart one many different diagram type
alternative notation process flow
Common alternative name include flow chart process flowchart functional flowchart process map process chart functional process chart business process model process model process flow diagram diagram business flow diagram
The term flowchart flow chart used interchangeably
The underlying structure flowchart flow graph abstract away node type content ancillary information
The first structured method documenting process flow introduced member presentation Process Charts First Steps Finding One Best Way Work
The Gilbreths tool quickly found way curriculum
In early industrial engineer began training business people use tool industrial engineering Work Simplification Conferences
A graduate class Art Spinanger took tool back developed Deliberate Methods Change Program
Another graduate Director Formcraft Engineering adapted flow process chart information processing development process chart display multiple document relationship
In adopted symbol set derived Gilbreth original work ASME Standard Operation Flow Process Charts
explained developed flowchart originally diagram plan computer program
His contemporary account endorsed IBM engineer Goldstine personal recollection
The original programming flowchart Goldstine von Neumann seen unpublished report Planning coding problem electronic computing instrument Part II Volume reproduced von Neumann collected work
Flowcharts became popular mean describing
The popularity flowchart decreased interactive became common tool
Algorithms expressed much concisely
Often used us common idiom language without strictly adhering detail particular one
Nowadays flowchart still used describing
Modern technique considered extension flowchart
Sterneckert suggested flowchart modeled perspective different user group manager system analyst clerk four general type Notice every type flowchart focus kind control rather particular flow
However several classification
For example Andrew Veronis named three basic type flowchart
That year Marilyn Bohl stated practice two kind flowchart used solution planning
More recently Mark Fryman stated difference Decision flowchart logic flowchart system flowchart product flowchart process flowchart different type flowchart used business government
In addition many diagram technique exist similar flowchart carry different name
The American National Standards Institute ANSI set standard flowchart symbol
The International Organizations Standardization ISO adopted ANSI symbol
The current standard revised
Generally flowchart flow top bottom left right
The standard include symbol beyond basic shape
Some For processing horizontal line horizontal bar indicate start end section process done independently Any drawing program used create flowchart diagram underlying data model share data database program system
Some tool offer special support flowchart drawing
Many exist create flowchart automatically either directly programming language source code flowchart description language
Online version program available
There several application use flowchart represent execute program
Generally used teaching tool beginner student

Org Charts short used show people intended structure organization
This formal organization supposed reflect power structure company
Sometimes Org Charts serve confuse people structure really
This usually intentional rather REFLECTS confusion people involved
However also possible use Org Chart management tool achievement organization goal
We examine typical example standard Org Charts
We look confusing Org Charts
Finally discus use Org Chart management tool
Standard Org Charts typically used show people intended structure organization
This formal organization supposed reflect power structure company
Often reflects responsibility structure
The real power organization often follows line communication instead line Org Chart
The chart typically pyramidal shape
They show person charge top
Below clustered subordinate usually progressively smaller box
Usually individual shown horizontal level Org Chart perceived peer within organization
This typical pyramid chart
The Head Department five director report directly plus Deputy Head search committee
Each Directors direct report shown green oval committee
Sometimes Org Charts confuse people structure really
This usually intentional rather reflects confusion people involved
If unsure group functional relationship frequently change virtually impossible accurately diagram
Perhaps common place find confusing Org Charts US federal government
The Org Chart Oak Ridge National Laboratory rapidly convey understanding Organization structure
It seems suggest eleven function report directly Director
While span control number direct report manager effectively supervise vary considerably I find hard believe optimally functioning organization
I suspect function leader equal
If chart communication flow within organization amount time subordinate spent director direct report would probably need reclassified subordinate function
Org Charts usually reactive rather proactive device
We created organization allowed one evolve grown
It longer clear people within organization people interact responsible
So draw bunch box line show everybody
Then add dashed line similar artificial device show drew first really always case
A better option however craft Org Chart reflects want organization go rather simply reflects
If want flat horizontal organization draw Org Chart way
Show six eight even eleven saw manager report
Show ten programmer report directly
If organization relies quality circle production team accomplish mission show Org Chart
Don feel constrained stick horizontal grouping vertical line
If employee clearly understand role use circle inverted triangle whatever else need
There many software product market help show want organization function
example kind tool used clarify many aspect business including Org Charts
The example representation Org Chart impressed greatly
It released usher new era company required creative new action employee
It clearly show flat horizontal structure intended foster communication innovation
It clearly show team formed top two officer indicative employee expected
Yet retains unequivocal line final responsibility
The President clearly leading company everyone else know part succeed
The Way Org Chart Should Be It still early tell Org Chart desired effect
It place couple week
However company officer clearly used tool help drive organization toward new goal

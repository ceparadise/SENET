In replaces runtime computation simpler array indexing operation
The saving term processing time significant since retrieving value memory often faster undergoing expensive computation operation
The table may precalculated stored program storage calculated part program initialization phase even stored hardware platform
Lookup table also used extensively validate input value matching list valid invalid item array programming language may include pointer function offset label process matching input
also make extensive use reconfigurable lookup table provide programmable hardware functionality
Before advent computer lookup table value used speed hand calculation complex function statistical density function
In ancient CE India created one first encoded number system
In wrote multiplication table gave product every number time row list number starting one thousand descending hundred one hundred descending ten ten one one fraction Modern school child often taught memorize avoid calculation commonly used number x x
Early history computer operation particularly slow even comparison processor speed time
It made sense reduce expensive read operation form manual creating either static lookup table embedded program dynamic prefetched array contain commonly occurring data item
Despite introduction systemwide caching automates process application level lookup table still improve performance data item rarely ever change
Lookup table one earliest functionality implemented computer initial version including function among original function
This followed subsequent spreadsheet complemented specialized function simplify lookup vertical horizontal table
This known element checked equality turn associated value used result search
This often slowest search method unless frequently occurring value occur early list
For array lookup usually determine whether match data value
An example involves element found determining half table match may found repeating either success failure
This possible list sorted give good performance even list lengthy
For lookup unsigned value used index table extract result
For small range amongst fastest lookup even exceeding binary search speed zero branch executing
One discrete problem expensive solve many computer counting number bit set binary number sometimes called
For example decimal number binary contains three bit set binary
A simple example code designed count bit might look like This apparently simple algorithm take potentially hundred cycle even modern architecture make many branch loop branching slow
This ameliorated using compiler optimization
There however simple much faster algorithmic solution using table lookup
Simply construct static table entry giving number one bit set possible byte value

Then use table find number one byte integer using lookup byte turn sum
This requires branch four indexed memory access considerably faster earlier code
The source improved easily avoiding shifting byte unsigned char array preferably coded single statement instead function
Note even simple algorithm slow original code might run faster cache modern processor large lookup table fit well cache cause slower access memory addition example requires computing address within table perform four lookup needed
In data analysis application lookup table LUT used transform input data desirable output format
For example grayscale picture planet Saturn transformed color image emphasize difference ring
A classic example reducing computation using lookup table obtain result calculation value
Calculating trigonometric function substantially slow computing application
The application finish much sooner first precalculates sine number value example whole number degree The table defined static variable compile time reducing repeated run time cost
When program requires sine value use lookup table retrieve closest sine value memory address may also take step interpolating sine desired value instead calculating mathematical formula
Lookup table thus used mathematics computer system
An error lookup table responsible Intel infamous
Functions single variable sine cosine may implemented simple array
Functions involving two variable require multidimensional array indexing technique
The latter case may thus employ array replace function calculate limited range x value
Functions one result may implemented lookup table array structure
As mentioned intermediate solution use table combination small amount computation often using
combined interpolation produce higher accuracy value fall two precomputed value
This technique requires slightly time performed greatly enhance accuracy application require higher accuracy
Depending value precomputed interpolation also used shrink lookup table size maintaining accuracy
In lookup table often called give output value range index value
One common LUT called used determine color intensity value particular image displayed
In windowing refers related concept determining display intensity measured radiation
While often effective employing lookup table may nevertheless result severe penalty computation LUT replaces relatively simple
Memory retrieval time complexity memory requirement increase application operation time system complexity relative would required straight formula computation
The possibility may also become problem
Table access large table almost certainly cause
This phenomenon increasingly becoming issue processor outpace memory
A similar issue appears
In environment table lookup even expensive due mandatory involving additional comparison branch lookup
There two fundamental limitation possible construct lookup table required operation
One amount memory available one construct lookup table larger space available table although possible construct lookup table expense lookup time
The time required compute table value first instance although usually need done take prohibitively long time may make use lookup table inappropriate solution
As previously stated however table statically defined many case
Most computer perform basic arithmetic operation directly calculate given value
Instead use algorithm complex formula following compute value sine high degree precision However expensive compute especially slow processor many application particularly traditional need compute many thousand sine value every second
A common solution initially compute sine many evenly distributed value find sine choose sine value closest
This close correct value sine bounded rate change
For example Unfortunately table requires quite bit space IEEE number used byte would required
We use fewer sample precision significantly worsen
One good solution draw line two point table either side value locates answer line
This still quick compute much accurate sine function
Here example using linear interpolation Another solution us quarter space take bit longer compute would take account relationship sine cosine along symmetry rule
In case lookup table calculated using sine function first quadrant
sin
When need value assign variable angle wrapped first quadrant
We wrap angle four quadrant needed value always return correct value
first quadrant straight return second quadrant read third fourth negative first second respectively
For cosine return angle shifted

For tangent divide sine cosine handling may needed depending implementation When using interpolation size lookup table reduced using mean function close straight use sample point change value quickly use sample point keep approximation close real curve
For information see
Storage cache including disk cache file processor cache either code data work also like lookup table
The table built fast memory instead stored slower external memory maintains two piece data subrange bit composing external memory disk address notably lowest bit possible external address A single fast lookup performed read tag lookup table index specified lowest bit desired external storage address determine memory address hit cache
When hit found access external memory needed except write operation cached value may need updated asynchronously slower memory time position cache must replaced cache another address
In lookup table implemented whose select line driven address signal whose input value element contained array
These value either purpose specific function provided allow configurable value
An LUT encode storing function LUT
This efficient way encoding function LUTs bit input fact key component modern FPGAs provide reconfigurable hardware logic capability

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
It often said hash table lookup operates constant time compute hash value give index array lookup
Yet ignores collision worst case every item happens land bucket lookup time becomes linear n
Are condition data make hash table lookup truly O
Is average hash table O worst case lookup

There two setting get O time
If setup static FKS hashing get O guarantee
But indicated setting static
If use Cuckoo hashing query deletes O insertion O expected
Cuckoo hashing work quite well upper bound total number insert set table size roughly larger
There information
Assume set value V n want store array A size
We employ hash function h V typically M
We call n A
Here assume natural practical scenario M though map
The first observation even h uniform probability two value hash value high essentially instance infamous
Therefore usually deal conflict abandon hope O worst case access time
What average case though
Let u assume every key occurs probability
The average number checked entry successful search resp
unsuccessful search depends conflict resolution method used
Every array entry contains pointer head linked list
This good idea expected list length small n even though probability collision high
In end get This improved slightly storing list partly completely inside table
When inserting resp
searching value v check position h v h v h v order empty position resp
v found
The advantage work locally without secondary data structure however number average access diverges For however performance comparable
Similar linear probing search step size controlled second hash function coprime M
No formal derivation given empirical observation suggest This method adapted Brent variant amortises increased insertion cost cheaper search
Note removing element extending table varying degree difficulty respective method
choose implementation adapts well typical use case
Expected access time O possible always guaranteed
Depending used method keeping low essential trade expected access time versus space overhead
A good choice h also central obviously
As arbitrarily uninformed programmer may provide h assumption regarding quality stretch practice
Note coincides
A defined injective function set S subset integer
If perfect hash function exists data storage need easily get O behavior
For instance get O performance hash table following task given array l integer set S integer determine whether l contains x x S
A step would involve making hash table O followed checking element S O
Altogether O
A naive implementation using linear search might O using binary search O note solution O space since hash table must map distinct integer l distinct bin
EDIT To clarify hash table generated O The list l contains integer finite set U N possibly repeat S U
We want determine whether x S l
To hash table element l lookup table
The hash table encode function h U true
To define h initially assume h x false x U
Then linearly scan element l setting h true
This take O time O space
Notice original analysis assumed l contained least O distinct element
If contains fewer distinct element say O space requirement may higher although O
The hash table stored simple array
The hash function identity function U
Notice identity function trivially perfect hash function
h hash table encodes separate function
I try improve soon
A perfect hash function result O worst case lookup
Moreover maximum number collision possible O hash table lookup said O worst case
If expected number collision O hash table lookup said O average case

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

In Computer Science course learning Lookup Tables
But teacher provide example lesson page posted video provided
All tell u want u use next assignment
But failed give u example
We learning Arrays got Lookup Tables
Can someone You use map store pair lookup value key If supposed using Arrays nice simple
Now access one number use index
ie So access value array using index key
In understanding lookup table way get value given key much faster iterative searching ie would search best find matched value n
With lookupTable go directly value need without iterating using key
Say looking find Java variable type given mySql datatype
You could use Map
Then could find conversion value VARCHAR data type Java would By posting answer agree

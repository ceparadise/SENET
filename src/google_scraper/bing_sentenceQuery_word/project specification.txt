Review detail
Word mouth valued form marketing
I reward client refer others

In basic form spec represent scope project developer
Consider following If one ask architect cost estimate new home one would expect hear Well depends
And obvious people depends since everyone know little house living
It depends many bedroom bathroom many story want garage whether want marble countertop
Etc
These specification house determine cost timeline
I frequently asked much website cost
And I say Well depends
What functionality need
I see fear confusion come across people face
After lot experience phenomenon I come believe unlike house example people familiar in out website generally know option available relative value
For estimate much project cost I need specification kind
A project spec like blueprint website
It communicates specific detail project need planned budgeted implemented
It give accurate impression purpose scope timeline functionality involved project
The thorough spec accurate estimate
In way best interest thorough possible specification
If sure even start specification draft together
When drafting project spec account much following list possible
If area unclear required I assist flushing initial consult
The following often included project specification And know wonderful application made possible
Without system would way handle efficiently
Thanks visionary planning creativity
Althea Gonzalez Director Health Parity You deserve ton kudos Ben

Some renewable energy source affect network distributed manner whilst unit little influence large population significant impact global network particularly case synchronised behaviour
This work investigates behaviour large heterogeneous population photovoltaic panel connected grid
We employ Markov model represent aggregated behaviour population rest network associated consumption modelled single equivalent generator accounting inertia frequency regulation
Analysis simulation model show realistic abstraction quantitatively indicate heterogeneity necessary enable overall network function safe condition avoid load shedding
This project provide extension recent research

In project plan investigate develop new analysis verification technique based abstraction directly applicable general SHS model computationally scalable
Courses Formal Verification Probabilistic Model Checking Probability Computing Automata Logic Games Prerequisites Familiarity stochastic process formal verification Smart microgrids version centralized electricity system locally generate distribute regulate flow electricity consumer
Among advantage microgrids shown positive effect reliability distribution network
These system present heterogeneity complexity coming local volatile renewables generation presence nonlinear dynamic continuous discrete variable
These factor call development proper quantitative model
This framework provides opportunity employing formal method verify property microgrid
The goal project particular focus energy production via renewables photovoltaic panel
The project benefit form paid industrial partner
Courses Formal Verification Probabilistic Model Checking Probability Computing Automata Logic Games Prerequisites Familiarity stochastic process formal verification whereas specific knowledge smart grid needed
This project targeted enhance software tollbox VeriSiMPL simple developed enable abstraction MPL model
MPL model specified MATLAB abstracted Labeled Transition Systems LTS
The LTS abstraction formally put relationship MPL counterpart via bi simulation relation
The abstraction procedure run MATLAB leverage sparse representation fast manipulation based vector calculus optimized data structure Matrices
LTS pictorially represented via Graphviz tool exported PROMELA language
This enables verification MPL model temporal specification within SPIN model checker
Courses Formal Verification Numerical Solution Differential Equations Prerequisites Some familiarity dynamical system working knowledge MATLAB C This project explore connection technique machine learning successful approach formal verification
The project two side theoretical one practical one student emphasise either two side depending background interest
The theoretical part develop existing research instance one following two domain pair learning repair reachability analysis Bayesian inference
On hand practical project apply theoretical connection simple model setup area robotics autonomy
Formal Verification Probabilistic Model Checking Machine Learning This project shall investigate rich research line recently pursued within Department CS looking development quantitative abstraction Markovian model
Abstractions come form lumped aggregated model beneficial easier simulate analyse
Key novelty work proposed abstraction quantitative precise error bound original model established
As whatever shown abstract model well formally discussed original one
This project grounded existing literature pursue depending student interest extension recent work implementation software tool

Among specification SHS probabilistic invariance received quite attention recently
Numerical method developed compute two specification
These method mainly based state space partitioning abstraction SHS Markov chain optimal sense reduction abstraction error minimum number Markov state
The goal project combine code developed method
The student also design nice user interface choice dynamical equation parameter method etc
Courses Probabilistic Model Checking Probability Computing Numerical Solution Differential Equations Prerequisites Some familiarity stochastic process working knowledge MATLAB C Contextuality fundamental feature quantum physical theory one distinguishes classical mechanic
In recent paper Abramsky Brandenburger categorical notion sheaf used formalize contextuality
This resulted generalizing extending contextuality theory share structural property quantum mechanic
A consequence type modeling succinct logical axiomatization property correlation result classical go theorem Bell
Like quantum mechanic natural language contextual feature subject much study distributional model meaning originated work Firth later advanced Schutze
These model based vector space semiring positive real inner product operation
The vector represent meaning word based context often appear inner product measure degree word synonymy
Despite success modeling word meaning vector space suffer two major shortcoming firstly immediately scale sentence secondly least intuitive way provide semantics logical word
Recent work group developed compositional distributional model meaning natural language lift vector space meaning phrase sentence
This already led promising experimental result
However approach deal well logical word
The goal project use sheaf theoretic model provide contextual logical semantics natural language

There lot sort thing though would necessary bit original
Think perhaps think something little le ambitious
It might involve logic proof might sequence series might graph might mathematics cryptography might something else mind

Copy get much attention
As well known Intel disable TSX processor via microcode update
This due bug TSX implementation could give erroneous result instruction used
What seems le well known apparently also erratum affecting TSX newer architecture Skylake
Specifically erratum mentioned It specifically state using TSX lead unpredictable system behavior
However also note possible BIOS carry fix
However question fix entail
Does disable TSX altogether like Haswell microcode fix
Googling give result seems community generally unaware
Some user noticed TSX feature getting steathily disabled seemingly unaware erratum It strange certain variant CPUs affected since one would presume would share microarchitecture hence equally affected bug
By way another way microcode fix could operate could even stealthy I suppose would possible make microcode update would still expose presence TSX making seem feature still enabled would override implementation new TSX instruction dummy implementation actually would never elide lock essentially execute code way thereby avoiding bug also foregoing performance improvement TSX could offer
The way determine happened would performance measurement
Anyone info status TSX Skylake
In case strange info released one guess affected
And indeed feature safe use
I feature still
But also depends whether BIOS manufacturer taken microcode update also I actually measured performance I ca exclude could still disabled cf

I trying implement erratum decoder
My current approach use common algorithm lot optimization trick known Euclidian algorithm similar pretty much case initialization variable output calculation method different
What I know What I know mix extension compute polynomial
In fact I think I miss erratum evaluator polynomial see
To clearer figure describe variation BM I cited book As I compute erasure evaluator polynomial erasure locator polynomial I initialize Gamma A erasure evaluator polynomial like Lambda B erasure locator polynomial end BM erratum evaluator polynomial contains term high order cancelled example Instead correct I guess initialization erratum evaluator support polynomial A wrong erasure Gamma A erasure initialized erasure evaluator polynomial I could find academic paper describing initialization value
The paper I found describing erratum decoder computing simultaneously locator evaluator polynomial using Euclidian algorithm instead BM But seems using approach I initializing Gamma A Omega little omega erasure evaluator polynomial trimming inside conditional branch return algo limiting index Omega
Do someone know value Gamma A initialized avoid playing high order term trimming hack

When Erratum Search RHN site provide specific package name I get result
The result returned I single RHBA number I click link
The next page list bug issue Description
What I would like know package affect
Are package Packages affected package package Packages fixed package need installed
Thanks
To expand comment Ignacio answer answer right The erratum give full name updated correct package
The package name general convention RPMs Red Hat Fedora universe follow pattern Where package name upstream package version version package
Whenever package changed erratum even internal testing release increased
This enforced rpm enforced policy Red Hat Fedora respectable distribution
So covered latest erratum notice system already know system date
Although case may need restart service whole system make sure fix effect place reading notice helpful
They fixed package need freshened
older version need install

It probably expect one hour life
To get back story first Intel posted detail particular erratum back late April inside Core Specification Update PDF document explaing error could cause memory leak ultimately lead crash
This caught testing report open world
However motherboards today unstable enough even TLB buffer erratum cause system crash seriously doubt would reported back Intel
Most computer user default guilty guy guy name William Gates III Bill
Intel AMD substandard hardware CPUs placed blamed
After erratum posted Intel partner informed fix way
Later Intel pushed microcode update form BIOS update hardware partner already lot product channel correct BIOSes start
For others updating BIOS newer version apply hotly debated update
Biggest error affair disclosing microcode update complete story erratum leaving ground opened rampant speculation saw many forum Microsoft releasing security important update without description seriousness issue ground major panic born
The erratum something also known world TLB part microarchitecture improving access system memory much possible keeping refences physical memory table
Intel came back u following statement We addressed processor issue providing BIOS update customer way affect system performance
We documented erratum
All processor company erratum Intel erratum communication process inform customer public
Keep mind probability encountering issue low
Intel documented issue month ago Specification Updates affected processor available http
The erratum inside Core processor T series E series Q series QX series Xeon series appear rare case result computer refusing accept keyboard mouse input
In Windows environment may result worldly known Blue Screen Death world may end kernel panic
In conclusion problem fixed BIOS update motherboards containing fix erratum posted
Microsoft came patch stop erratum possibly appearing Apple already updated Mac OS X Linux status unknown time
It remains seen whether company rather choose go full disclosure every error happens future

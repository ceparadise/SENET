Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Why school offering software development degree opposed computer science
Are computer science degree good software development job software development degree
I see company advertise job say want computer science degree related
Also company wo accept le computer science computer engineering degree
I never seen one company say want hire someone software development degree
I know software development related I think company mean related math physic engineering etc
There widespread confusion lack clarity education come computer science
Formally computer science rigourous study information theory abstract notion would better called computing science
You likely computer science real job unless computing research though understanding fundamental useful particular le rigourous part computer science may seen include algorithm data structure understanding almost always job requirement
However little theory instead focus actually creating computer software
I posit course misnamed widespread unavoidable
In University offer Computer Science Software Engineering course I recommend taking latter want become professional software developer
That said impossible predict arbitrary company really asking job description
You really ask wing
In University offer Computer Science course read syllabus probably find Software Engineering course anyway mix discipline still useful likelihood
Some university offer course software development specialization computer science others offer separate degree
There really much difference concerning final result
Even separate degree would certainly count computer science related probably even le computer science computer engineering different name
Even job ad say want computer science graduate mean people whose major called imaginative name university introduce one reason another excluded
Coming back whether software development specialization main CS degree separate degree main difference My favorite description come Computer science really computer computer sense physic really particle accelerator biology microscope Petri dish geometry really using surveying instrument
Now reason think computer science computer pretty much reason Egyptians thought geometry surveying instrument field getting started really understand well easy confuse essence tool use
In word procedural knowledge methodically calculate operate information
application computer science concept resultant technology build software system
Another analogy I like Chemistry computer science Chemical engineering software development By posting answer agree

process involved creating maintaining resulting
Software development process writing broader sense includes involved conception desired software final manifestation software sometimes planned process
Therefore software development may include research new development prototyping modification reuse maintenance activity result software product
Software developed variety purpose three common meet specific need specific case meet perceived need set potential case personal use
scientist may write software automate mundane task
development used controlling consumer product requires development process integrated development controlled physical product
underlies application programming process often developed separately
The need better software development process given rise discipline aim apply systematic approach exemplified paradigm process software development
There many approach software project management known software development life cycle model methodology process model
The traditional version contrasted recent innovation
A also known software development methodology model life cycle framework used control process developing
A wide variety framework evolved year recognized strength weakness
There several different approach software development take structured approach developing business solution whereas others may take incremental approach software evolves developed
One system development methodology necessarily suitable use project
Each available methodology best suited specific kind project based various technical organizational project team consideration
Most methodology share combination following stage software development These stage often referred collectively software development lifecycle SDLC
Different approach software development may carry stage different order devote le time different stage
The level detail documentation produced stage software development may also vary
These stage may also carried turn waterfall based approach may repeated various cycle iteration extreme approach
The extreme approach usually involves le time spent planning documentation time spent coding development automated test
More extreme approach also promote continuous testing throughout development lifecycle well working product time
More structured based approach attempt ass majority risk develop detailed plan software coding begin avoid significant design change later stage software development lifecycle planning
There significant advantage disadvantage various methodology best approach solving problem using software often depend type problem
If problem well understood solution effectively planned ahead time waterfall based approach may work best
If hand problem unique least development team structure software solution easily envisioned extreme incremental approach may work best
The source idea software product plenteous
These idea come including potential new customer existing customer sale prospect rejected product internal software development staff creative third party
Ideas software product usually first evaluated personnel economic feasibility fit existing channel distribution possible effect existing product line required fit company marketing objective
In marketing evaluation phase cost time assumption become evaluated
A decision reached early first phase whether based detailed information generated marketing development staff project pursued
In book state chapter subchapter Students engineering learn engineering rarely exposed finance marketing
Students marketing learn marketing rarely exposed finance engineering
Most u become specialist one area
To complicate matter u meet interdisciplinary people workforce role mimic
Yet software product planning critical development success absolutely requires knowledge multiple discipline
Because software development may involve compromising going beyond required client software development project may stray le technical concern etc
These process may also cause role overlap software development
Planning objective every activity want discover thing belong project
An important task creating software program extracting
Customers typically abstract idea want end result know
Skilled experienced software engineer recognize incomplete ambiguous even contradictory requirement point
Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce risk requirement incorrect
Although much effort put requirement phase ensure requirement complete consistent rarely case leaving software design phase influential one come minimizing effect new changing requirement
Requirements volatility challenging impact future already going development effort
Once general requirement gathered client analysis scope development determined clearly stated
This often called scope document
Certain functionality may scope project function cost result unclear requirement start development
If development done externally document considered legal document ever dispute ambiguity promised client clarified
Once requirement established design software established
This involves preliminary main module overall picture part fit together
The language operating system hardware component known time
Then detailed design created perhaps firm requirement
part process actually code project
integral important phase software development process
This part process ensures recognized soon possible
In process generally known test may developed implementation serve guide implementation correctness
internal design software purpose future maintenance enhancement done throughout development
This may also include writing external internal
The software engineering process chosen developing team determine much internal documentation necessary
model generally produce documentation model
start directly code appropriately tested approved sold otherwise distributed production environment
This may involve installation customization setting parameter customer value testing possibly extended period evaluation
Software training important software effective used correctly
enhancing software cope newly discovered requirement take substantial time effort missed requirement may force redesign software
A framework provides used
It graphical representation underlying semantics view
The purpose viewpoint view enable human engineer comprehend organize element problem solution around domain
In physically intensive system viewpoint often correspond capability responsibility within engineering organization
Most complex system specification extensive one individual fully comprehend aspect specification
Furthermore different interest given system different reason examining
A executive ask different question system would system implementer
The concept viewpoint framework therefore provide separate viewpoint specification given complex system
These viewpoint satisfy audience interest set aspect system
Associated viewpoint viewpoint language optimizes vocabulary presentation audience viewpoint
current state information provides effective mean presenting information user system
Usually model created conducting interview referred
The interview consists facilitator asking series question designed extract required information describes process
The interviewer called facilitator emphasize participant provide information
The facilitator knowledge process interest important structured methodology question asked process expert
The methodology important usually team facilitator collecting information across facility result information interviewer must fit together completed
The model developed defining either current state process case final product called snapshot model collection idea process contain resulting model
Generation process data model used determine existing process information system sound need minor modification enhancement required corrective action
The creation business model way view automate information process
Analysis used fundamentally reshape way business organization conduct operation
CASE field scientific application set software tool method development result maintainable software product
It also refers method development together automated tool used software development process
The term software engineering CASE refer used automated development computer code
The CASE function include analysis design programming
CASE tool automate method designing documenting producing structured computer code desired
Two key idea Software System Engineering CASE Typical CASE tool exist
An IDE also known provides comprehensive facility software development
An IDE normally consists IDEs designed maximize programmer productivity providing component similar
Typically IDE dedicated specific provide feature set closely match language
A used express defined consistent set rule
The rule used interpretation meaning component structure
A modeling language graphical textual
Graphical modeling language use named symbol represent concept line connect symbol represent relationship various graphical annotation represent constraint
Textual modeling language typically use standardised keywords accompanied parameter make expression
Examples graphical modelling language field software engineering Not modeling language executable using necessarily mean programmer longer needed
On contrary executable modeling language intended amplify productivity skilled programmer address difficult problem
A fundamental style generally dictated project management methodology waterfall agile
Paradigms differ concept abstraction used represent element program object function variable constraint step comprise computation assignation evaluation continuation data flow
Sometimes concept asserted paradigm utilized cooperatively system architecture design case programming paradigm scope limited internal structure particular program module
A support
For example program written purely purely contain element paradigm
Software designer programmer decide use paradigm element
In programmer think program collection interacting object program thought sequence stateless function evaluation
When programming computer system many processor allows programmer think application set concurrent process acting upon logically shared
Just different group advocate different different advocate different
Some language designed support one paradigm support programming support functional programming programming language support multiple paradigm
Many programming paradigm well known method enable
For instance pure functional programming forbids using forbids using statement
Partly reason new paradigm often regarded doctrinaire overly rigid accustomed earlier style
Avoiding certain method make easier prove theorem program correctness simply understand behavior
Examples paradigm include

When use computer cell phone tablet video game system use software program game app device software developer thank making possible
These professional oversee everything involved creating software make device functional useful
There two type software developer
Systems software developer create software make computer device run
This includes computer device operating system
Applications software developer design software program like word processor database spreadsheet game

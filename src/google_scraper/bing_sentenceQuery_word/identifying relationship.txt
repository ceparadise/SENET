learn share knowledge build career
I able fully grasp difference
Can describe concept use real world example
An existence row child table depends row parent table
This may confusing common practice day create pseudokey child table make foreign key parent part child primary key
Formally right way make foreign key part child primary key
But logical relationship child exist without parent
Example A one phone number
If one phone number could simply store column
Since want support multiple phone number make second table whose primary key includes referencing table
We may think phone number belonging person even though modeled attribute separate table
This strong clue identifying relationship even literally include primary key
A primary key attribute parent become primary key attribute child
A good example lookup table foreign key referencing primary key
child table respect
But row identified attribute

part primary key
A relationship mean foreign key column allows NULL disallows NULL respectively
See also answer There another explanation real world A book belongs owner owner multiple book
But book exist also without owner ownership change one owner another
The relationship book owner relationship
A book however written author author could written multiple book
But book need written author exist without author
Therefore relationship book author identifying relationship
An Identifying relationship specifies child object exist without parent object relationship specifies regular association object n cardinality
relationship specified optional parent required mandatory parent required setting parent table cardinality
Here good description Relationships two entity may classified either identifying
Identifying relationship exist primary key parent entity included primary key child entity
On hand relationship exists primary key parent entity included child entity part child entity primary key
In addition relationship may classified either mandatory
A mandatory relationship exists value child table null
On hand relationship exists value child table null
Here simple example identifying relationship Here corresponding relationship A relationship mean child related parent identified
The relationship ACCOUNT PERSON
An identifying relationship mean parent needed give identity child
The child solely exists parent
This mean foreign key primary key
The relationship ITEM identifying
And LANGUAGE
correct among answer one point significant aspect
It said identifying relationship child exist without parent


This true completely miss point
It would enough enough foreign key achieve
It need part primary key
The purpose identifying relationship part primary key
identifying
second answer example book author relationship got vote ups
say A book however written author author could written multiple book
But book need written author exist without author
Therefore relationship book author identifying relationship
confusing example definitely
I finally understand difference relationship please confuse amount vote ups
yes book written without least one author author foreign key book book book table
remove author FK book row still identify book row field ISBN ID etc I think valid example would relationship product table specific product detail table example table considered FK reference table table identifying relationship FK printer table row inside child table ca remove child table ca identify row lost primary key want put line identifying relationship relationship FK child table considered PK identifier child table still reference parent table may table import product country import export country database table child field may use identify row import year column compose together primary key child table import also referencing parent table
please I happy I finally understand concept please tell I wrong vote ups yes logically book ca written without author book identified without author In fact ca identified author
please tell I misunderstood concept The identifing relaionship mean child entity totally depend existance parent entity
Example account table person table person account table identified existance account person table
The non identifing relationship mean child table identified existance parent table example table accounttype table identified existance account table
If consider child item deleted parent deleted identifying relationship
If child item kept even though parent deleted
As example I training database trainee training diploma training session Only training session deleted one related trainee training diploma deleted
A good example come order processing
An order customer typically Order Number identifies order data occurs per order order date Customer ID series line item
Each line item contains item number identifies line item within order product ordered quantity product price product amount line item could computed multiplying quantity price
The number identifies line item identifies context single order
The first line item every order item number
The complete identity line item item number together order number part
The parent child relationship order line item therefore identifying relationship
A closely related concept ER modeling go name subentity line item subentity order
Typically subentity mandatory identitying relationship entity subordinate
In classical database design primary key LineItems table would OrderNumber ItemNumber
Some today designer would give item separate ItemID serf primary key autoincremented DBMS
I recommend classical design case
Let say table relationship two table identifiying relationship
Because comment belong owner user
example
Each user comment user deleted user comment also deleted
Like well explained link identifying relation somewhat like weak entity type relation parent ER conceptual model
UML style CADs data modeling use ER symbol concept kind relation identifying
Identifying one relation child kind weak entity even traditional ER model called identifying relationship real primary key attribute therefore identified uniquely
Every access child table physical model dependent inclusive semantically parent primary key turn part total child primary key also foreign key generally resulting composite key child side
The eventual existing key child pseudo sufficient identify instance type Entity Entity Set without parent PK
relationship ordinary relation partial total completely independent entity set whose instance depend others primary key uniquely identified although might need foreign key partial total relationship primary key child
The child primary key
The parent idem
Both independently
Depending cardinality relationship PK one go FK N side partial null total must null
But relationship like FK never also PK child identifying relationship case
An identifying relationship two strong entity
A relationship may always relationship strong entity weak entity
There may exist situation child primary key existence entity may depend parent entity
For example relationship seller book book sold seller may exist seller may primary key entity created book sold Reference based Bill Karwin Thank interest question

So I reading identifying relationship database design number answer SO seem contradicting
Here two question I looking Looking top answer question I appear get two different idea identifying relationship
The first question response say identifying relationship describes situation existence row child table depends row parent table
An example given An author write many book relationship book exist without author
That make sense
However I read response question two I get confused say child identifies parent identifying relationship
The answer go give example identifying Person address many people live address
To sound like case decision primary key key
My gut feeling additional research site point first question response correct
However I wanted verify I continued forward I want learn something wrong I working understand database design
Thanks advance
The technical definition identifying relationship child foreign key part primary key
See
foreign key also one column primary key
So table identifying relationship referenced table
Likewise identifying relationship
A comment YouTube video identifying relationship respective video
The part primary key table
It may hard understand common practice day use serial surrogate key instead compound primary key This obscure case table identifying relationship
I would consider SSN represent identifying relationship
Some people exist SSN
Other people may file get new SSN
So SSN really attribute part person primary key
Re comment Niels So use surrogate key instead compound primary key notable difference use identifying relationship
I suppose
I hesitate say yes changed relationship table using surrogate key
That still ca make Comment without referencing existing Video
But mean must NOT NULL
And logical aspect really point identifying relationship
But physical aspect identifying relationship well
And fact foreign key column part primary key primary key necessarily composite key could single column primary key Comments well foreign key Videos table would mean store one comment per video
Identifying relationship seem important sake diagramming come GUI data modeling tool
I want learn something wrong
Welll really mean stop worrying ER lingo terminology
It imprecise confused confusing generally part irrelevant
ER bunch rectangle straight line drawn piece paper
ER deliberately intended mean modeling
As valuable first step database design also first step
Never shall ER diagram get anywhere near preciseness accuracy completeness database design formally written Identifying relationship concept ER modelling relationship identifying one represented foreign key part referencing table primary key
This usually little importance relational modelling term primary key relational model SQL database special significance function ER model
For example suppose table enforces two candidate key A B
Suppose A also foreign key table
The relationship thus represented deemed identifying A designated primary key B primary key
Yet form function meaning table identical case
This opinion I think identifying concept really important
I believe difference identifying non identifying relationship Nullability foreign key
If FK NULL relationship represents identifying child exist without parent else non identifying
part issue confusion terminology
identifying relationship useful avoiding long join path
The best definition seen identifying relationship includes PK parent child PK
In word PK child includes FK parent well actual PK child
Yes go first one think second one contradicts first one
It formulated little bit UPDATE Just checked second question answer wrong assumption necessarily n relation could In relational database creates intersection table n relation get identifying relation intersection table identifying relationship give one many optional relationship define parent child addition give one one relationship child parent parent entity primary key part primary key child entity child entity instance identify parent entity represented solid line er diagram
non identifying relationship many many existence child entity instance parent entity instance entity instance child entity may related many entity instance parent reason primary key parent entity well foreign key child entity child entity take parent entity primary key primary primary key
many many relation exist real world er diagram
need resolved By posting answer agree

Relational database allow data separated connected across several table
Tables connected primary foreign key increase efficiency
The main characteristic When working relational database user need try keep
Each entity primary key provide unique reference entity mean entity referenced another table without call detail entity

A relationship context database situation exists two relational database table one table foreign key reference primary key table
Relationships allow relational database split store data different table linking disparate data item
For example bank database table store customer data primary key column named also store customer data table hold information various bank account associated customer
To link two table determine customer bank account information corresponding column must inserted table referencing existing customer IDs table
In case table column foreign key reference column name table
This example relationship two table
The fundamental feature differentiates relational database database type ability define relationship

In pronounced narrative foreseeable interaction user role known technical system usually includes computer hardware software
A scenario usually functional
A scenario describes one way system envisaged used context activity defined
The scenario could example single transaction business operation day period whole operational life system
Similarly scope scenario could example single system piece equipment equipped team department entire organization
Scenarios frequently used part system development process
They typically produced usability marketing specialist often working concert end user developer
Scenarios written plain language minimal technical detail stakeholder designer usability specialist programmer engineer manager marketing specialist etc
common example focus discussion
Increasingly scenario used directly define wanted behaviour software replacing supplementing traditional
Scenarios often defined document alternative overlapping way reaching goal
Many type scenario use system development
Alexander Maiden list following type Negative scenario may written indicate likely threat countered ensure system sufficient
These help discover
Scenarios numerous possible application system development
Carroll list different role scenario system development lifecycle The choice scenario representation varies widely style development related industrial context

In informal natural language description one feature software system
User story often written perspective
They often recorded index card project management software
Depending project user story may written various stakeholder including client user manager development team member
User story type
They facilitate communication help software team organize understanding system context
User story often confused
A requirement formal description need user story informal description feature
In visited Chrysler project Detroit coined phrase A user story promise conversation
With XP user story part
In proposed Three Cs formula user story creation User story written user customer influence functionality system developed
In team product manager primarily responsible formulating user story organizing product backlog
In team anyone write user story
User story developed discussion stakeholder based simply made
User story may follow one several format template
The common would Chris Matts suggested hunting value first step successfully delivering software proposed alternative Elias Weldemichael hand suggested clause optional Another template based specifies Another template based Rachel Davies popular template fictional stakeholder
user
A persona may include name picture characteristic behaviour attitude goal product help achieve
As central part many agile development methodology user story define built software project
User story prioritized customer product owner indicate important system broken task estimated developer
One way estimating via
When user story implemented developer possibility talk customer
The short story may difficult interpret may require background knowledge requirement may changed since story written
Every user story must point one acceptance test attached allowing developer test user story done also allowing customer validate
Without precise formulation requirement prolonged nonconstructive argument may arise product delivered
There good evidence using user story increase software success developer productivity
However user story facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring linked success
Limitations user story include User story written small physical card hard maintain difficult scale large project troublesome geographically distributed team
User story card regarded conversation starter
Being informal open many interpretation
Being brief state detail necessary implement feature
Stories therefore inappropriate reaching formal agreement writing legal contract
User story rarely include performance requirement detail test
response time may overlooked

A blog
We dedicated giving every student every school opportunity learn computer programming
Not day go I read article speech need invest STEM education invest future student national competitiveness etc
Every time I hear STEM Science Technology Engineering Math I wish could focus conversation computer science
Why
Because three reason I explain See chart
Computer science STEM field job student
The data come government comparing job data projection Bureau Labor Statistics student data National Science Foundation
In chart computer science categorized alongside mathematics separated distinction would even greater favor CS
Now look computer science see field annual job growth almost rate student graduating bachelor degree
Computing job growing every state every industry
show job software computing company core driver recovery
And picture show fraction growth opportunity
Across field STEM computer science occupation top highest demand list lowest unemployment rate across field
Computer science impacting everything banking retail manufacturing entertainment across every industry country enough computer scientist fill open job
Google diversity gap workforce
Both tell similar story tech company hire men woman
For year author STEM problem talk fixing gender gap STEM addressing education pipeline student STEM field
If ask parent student STEM mostly know
By contrast far people familiar term like biology chemistry
I ran Meanwhile huge disconnect meaning STEM depending audience
When politician businessmen leader talk importance STEM mostly referring new stuff new technology innovation advancement invention driving growth national competitiveness
But STEM translated practice public education system translate topic already taught today school algebra geometry calculus biology chemistry physic
One hundred percent US public school teach math science
But percent NOT teach computer science encouraged teach STEM increase funding STEM turn course already teach
I run nonprofit called focused bringing computer science school offering free curriculum support school want add course option
The biggest obstacle work enough school district administrator feel need teach computer science
They need hear parent important
If high school parent ask school district offer computer science proper course alongside algebra biology chemistry
Don ask technology computer STEM even coding
Ask computer science

As long team keep storyboard date anyone see work completed working work left
This provides also help team visualize sequence interconnectedness
Storyboards physical digital
Storyboards originated motion picture industry help director cinematographer visual film scene sequence
Such storyboards resemble cartoon strip
In Agile development however storyboard look le like cartoon panel like series column filled colored square paper
Typically column laid large format paper bulletin board

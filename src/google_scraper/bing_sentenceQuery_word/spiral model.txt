The generator software project
Based unique risk pattern given project spiral model guide team adopt element one process model
This model first described paper A Spiral Model Software Development Enhancement
In Boehm published similar paper wider audience
These paper introduce diagram reproduced many subsequent publication discussing spiral model
These early paper use term process model refer spiral model well incremental waterfall prototyping approach
However spiral model characteristic blending process model feature already present R subsetting spiral model step allows model accommodate appropriate mixture automatic approach software development
In later publication Boehm describes spiral model process model generator choice based project risk generate appropriate process model project
Thus incremental waterfall prototyping process model special case spiral model fit risk pattern certain project
Boehm also identifies number misconception arising oversimplification original spiral model diagram
He say dangerous misconception While misconception may fit risk pattern project true project
In National Research Council report model extended include risk related human user
To better distinguish hazardous spiral Boehm list six characteristic common authentic application spiral model
Authentic application spiral model driven cycle always display six characteristic
Boehm illustrates example hazardous spiral violates invariant
Sequentially defining key artifact project often lower possibility developing system meet stakeholder win condition objective constraint
This invariant excludes hazardous spiral process use sequence incremental waterfall pass setting underlying assumption waterfall model apply
Boehm list assumption follows In situation assumption apply project risk specify requirement proceed sequentially
The waterfall model thus becomes special case spiral model
This invariant identifies four activity must occur cycle spiral model Project cycle omit shortchange activity risk wasting effort pursuing option unacceptable key stakeholder risky
Some hazardous spiral process violate invariant excluding key stakeholder certain sequential phase cycle
For example system maintainer administrator might invited participate definition development system
As result system risk failing satisfy win condition
For project activity requirement analysis design prototyping testing project team must decide much effort enough
In authentic spiral process cycle decision made minimizing overall risk
For example investing additional time testing software product often reduces risk due marketplace rejecting shoddy product
However additional testing time might increase risk due competitor early market entry
From spiral model perspective testing performed total risk minimized
Hazardous spiral violate invariant include evolutionary process ignore risk due scalability issue incremental process invest heavily technical architecture must redesigned replaced accommodate future increment product
For project artifact requirement specification design document test plan project team must decide much detail enough
In authentic spiral process cycle decision made minimizing overall risk
Considering requirement specification example project precisely specify feature risk reduced precise specification interface hardware software interface prime sub contractor
Conversely project precisely specify feature precise specification increase risk graphical screen layout behavior component
Boehm original description spiral model include process milestone
In later refinement introduces three anchor point milestone serve progress indicator point commitment
These anchor point milestone characterized key question
Hazardous spiral violate invariant include evolutionary incremental process commit significant resource implementing solution poorly defined architecture
The three anchor point milestone fit easily RUP LCO marking boundary RUP Inception Elaboration phase LCA marking boundary Elaboration Construction phase IOC marking boundary Construction Transition phase
This invariant highlight importance overall system concern spanning entire life cycle
It excludes hazardous spiral focus much initial development software code
These process result following published approach structured software analysis design neglecting aspect project process need

The theory proposed stipulates individual fear result idea social group society general might isolate neglect exclude member due member opinion
This fear isolation consequently lead remaining silent instead voicing opinion
Media important factor relates dominant idea people perception dominant idea
The assessment one social environment may always correlate reality
According Shelly Neill Introduced Spiral Silence Theory explores hypothesis determine group remain silent others vocal forum public disclosure
The spiral silence theory suggests people believed hold minority viewpoint public issue remain background communication restrained believe hold majority viewpoint encouraged speak
The theory explains formation social norm micro macro level
As spiral silence examines opinion expression controlling people predisposition fear isolation also demographic variable shown influence people willingness publicly express opinion issue agricultural biotechnology
The spiral silence occurs macro level member perceived minority fall silent
This public perception opinion climate begin shift
In word person individual reluctance express opinion simply based perception everyone else think important implication social level
As one opinion gain interest majority minority face threat fear isolation society
As opinion gain momentum majority minority continues threatened fall deeper silence
It continues minority longer speaks opinion perceived majority ultimately becomes social norm
The spiral model analogy used visually describe theory
The end refers number people publicly expressing opinion due fear isolation
An individual likely go spiral opinion conform perceived majority opinion
The following step summarize process work This process formation change reinforcement public opinion
The tendency one speak silent start spiraling process increasingly establishes one opinion dominant one
Over time changing perception establish one opinion predominant one change liquid state solid norm
Further describes spiral silence prediction public opinion become fact mass medium coverage becomes minority becomes le likely speak
Scholars long argued concept within public opinion
The use public betrays multiple competing meaning
There three meaning public
One meaning legal sense public focus openness
For example public place path
A second meaning term emphasizes public right
Lastly within phrase public opinion public said related different definition
Public sense could characterized social psychology
Scholars marveled amazement power public opinion making regulation norm moral rule triumph individual self without ever troubling legislator government court assistance
Common Scottish social philosopher called published work
Agreement sense common lay behind English French opinion
In researching term opinion German researcher led back
In Plato quote conclude opinion take middle position
considered opinion insufficient judgement subjectively well objectively
How valuable opinion may left however fact suggested unified agreement population segment population still considered
The term first emerged France eighteenth century
The definition public opinion debated time
There much progress locking one classification phrase German historian stated Whoever desire grasp define concept public opinion recognize quickly dealing appears simultaneously thousand guise visible phantom impotent surprisingly efficacious present innumerable transformation forever slipping finger believe firm grip That float flow understood locked formula After asked everyone know exactly public opinion mean
It said fiction belonged museum history idea could historical interest
In contradiction quote term public opinion seemed cease
During early Elisabeth creating theory spiral silence
She making effort clarify finding voting intention would change yet expectation one side would win continued increase
began question indeed grabbing handle public opinion actually
The spiral silence might one form public opinion appeared might process new youthful public opinion develops whereby transformed meaning old opinion spread
The American sociologist described using word cheap
The equation opinion opinion run like common thread many definition
This speaks fact something clinging public opinion set condition move individual act even
Many possible meaning definition term explored
Scholars considered content public opinion assumed consist public affair issue
Scholars point emergence public opinion depends open public discourse rather discipline imposed apparent majority dominant enough intimidate whose view may may support action common interest
They also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion assumed person community ready express responsibly question public relevance
Scholars also looked form public opinion said openly expressed accessible opinion made public especially mass medium
Controversy surrounding term spiraled around word combining form phrase
Mass medium effect public opinion perception public opinion central Spiral Silence Theory
One earliest work called attention relationship medium formation public opinion book Public Opinion published
Ideas Lippmann regarding effect medium influenced emergence Spiral Silence Theory
As building spiral theory state reader complete explain world making use consciousness large measure created mass medium
another work build characterizing medium effect public opinion
theory describes relationship medium public opinion asserting public importance issue depends salience medium
Along setting agenda medium determines salient issue constant battle event attempting gain place agenda
The medium battle news alternative creating
Media characteristic communication tool affect people perception idea regard public opinion
According medium indirect public form communication contrasting threefold natural form human communication
These characteristic medium particular overwhelm one individual idea
While medium communication theory assume passive audience spiral model assumes active audience consumes medium product context personal social goal
Knowledge gained mass medium may offer ammunition people express opinion offer rationale stance
Ho et al
point among individual paid high amount medium attention low fear isolation significantly likely offer rationale opinion high fear isolation
regard medium central formulation Spiral Silence Theory whereas scholar argue whether dominant idea one social environment overwhelms dominant idea medium proposes perceived social norm
Some empirical research align perspective suggesting individual overwhelms effect medium
Other article suggest talking others primary way understanding opinion climate
The fear isolation centrifugal force accelerates spiral silence
Essentially people fear becoming social isolates thus take measure avoid consequence demonstrated psychologist
People feel comfortable agreeing opinion know wrong instead telling others idea
This assumption proposes order avoid becoming isolated order lose popularity esteem people constantly observe environment closely
They try find opinion mode behaviour prevalent opinion mode behaviour becoming popular
They behave express accordingly public
Then try determine whether majority whether public opinion tends agree
If feel minority tend remain silent
Individuals use described innate ability sense gauge
People assume sense figure others thinking
The play large part determining dominant opinion since direct observation limited small percentage population
The mass medium enormous impact public opinion portrayed dramatically impact individual perception public opinion lie whether portrayal factual
may occur case leading minority opinion accepted norm
Group member may privately rejecting norm may falsely assume group member accept
This phenomenon may cause group hold norm
Our evaluation public opinion effect decision speak
Where opinion relatively definite static custom example one express act according opinion public run risk becoming isolated
In contrast opinion flux disputed individual try find opinion express without becoming isolated
Individuals tend publicly express opinion attitude perceive view dominant rise
Conversely individual perceive opinion le popular losing popularity le likely voice public
What one individual decides affect society around
The theory explains complement stating people highly educated greater affluence cavalier individual fear isolation likely speak regardless public opinion
It state minority necessary factor change compliant majority necessary factor stability product evolution
There vocal minority remains top spiral defiance threat isolation
This theory call vocal minority hardcore nonconformist
Hardcore nonconformist people already rejected belief nothing lose speaking
The hardcore ability reconfigure majority opinion
While intellectual artist reformer isolated minority speak convinced ahead time
The spiral silence brought insight regarding diverse topic ranging speaking popular culture phenomenon smoking
Considering spiral silence likely occur controversial issue issue moral component many scholar applied theory controversial topic
Existing literature prior spiral silence theory suggest relationship social motivating communication scholar conduct analysis theory
Scholars field particular previously addressed cultural variance involved conformity majority opinion
More recent study confirm link conformity culture regarding example suggest culture likely exhibit conformity individualistic culture
Huiping Huang analyzes result telephone survey done Taiwan United States
The hypothesis tested belief United States Taiwan society
This suggested spiral silence le likely activated United States individual likely put emphasis personal goal
They put I identity identity strive personal success
Therefore hypothesized would likely speak regardless minority
On hand predicted individual Taiwan put emphasis collective goal would conform majority influence hope avoiding tension conflict
The study also tested effect motif including
Telephone survey conducted citizen United States questioned regard American involvement citizen Taiwan possibility direct presidential election
Both issue focused politics human right therefore comparable
Respondents asked choose favor neutral oppose regard category family friend medium society society future given issue
Measurements also taken regarding collectivism construct motif expressing opinion based scale respectively approval given statement
Results showed support original hypothesis
Overall Americans likely speak Taiwanese
Being incongruous majority lessened motivation Taiwanese speak higher collectivist score little effect Americans
In Taiwan future support belief society played large role likeliness voice opinion support activation spiral silence effect
In United States hypothesized individualistic would likely speak minority incongruous group
However true Huang suggests perhaps issue chosen directly prevalent therefore found unnecessary voice objection majority opinion
Lack led lack speaking country
article Spencer Croucher analyzes public perception Euskadi Ta Askatasuna militant separatist group Spain France
This study conducted similar way Basque individual Spain France questioned support ETA
They asked question How likely would enter conversation stranger train ETA
Taken consideration cultural difference two different region ETA existed
The result supported theory spiral silence
While highly unfavorable opinion group lack outcry stop
Individuals claimed likely voice opinion suggesting fear isolation regard fellow
Furthermore Spanish individual questioned likely silent greater proximity violent act
One study Henson Denker investigates perception silencing behavior political difference correlate perception university
They looked whether student view classroom change whether perceive instructor classmate different political affiliation instructor classmate communicating using silencing behavior
The article stated little investigated interaction classroom student influenced
The goal article determine political idea expressed university classroom thus ass influence classroom communication perception political tolerance
The article claimed university classroom adequate place scrutinize spiral silence theory place
Henson Denker said Because classroom interaction societal discourse mutually influential instructor student bring bias cultural perspective classroom
The study researched whether correlation student perception politically silenced perceived difference political affiliation
The study also questioned whether connection perceived climate similarity student instructor political affiliation
The researcher used participant Midwestern university communication course
The student answered survey perception political silencing classroom climate climate created instructor
The result research found positive relationship perceived similarity political party difference student instructor perceived greater political silencing
While study regarding spiral silence theory focused theory later applied environment
The first study context analyzed communication behavior online chat room regarding issue abortion revealed minority opinion holder likely speak whereas comment remained neutral
Another study focused Korean bulletin board posting regarding national election found relationship online posting presentation candidate mainstream medium
The third study focus online review system suggesting fear isolation tend reduce willingness member voice neutral negative review
The Spiral Silence Theory extended context multichannel communication platform need consider role communicative affordances online opinion expression also addressed
Current literature suggests spiral model applied context
Gearhart Zhang conduct study examine whether use social medium increase people motivation express opinion political issue
The result suggest social medium user received strong negative reaction politically related post likely censor exemplifying spiral silence effect
Another research confirms positive relationship speaking issue importance social medium context well individual view significant social issue likely comment Facebook
The spiral silence theory also applied context
Recent study see social capital variable enables citizen develop norm trust reciprocity necessary successful engagement collective activity
One study examines three indicator social capital trust neighborliness relationship indicator people willingness express opinion perception support one opinion
The result suggest civic engagement direct effect people willingness express opinion neighborliness trust direct positive effect people perception support one opinion
Also study show direct indirect effect civic engagement opinion expression highlight potential difference bonding bridging social capital
The concept isolation variety definition dependent upon circumstance investigated
In one instance problem isolation defined defined low relative frequency peer interaction
Other researcher defined isolation low level peer acceptance high level
Research considers isolation regard Internet either focus Internet make individual isolated society cutting contact live human being Internet decrease people allowing expand giving mean stay touch friend family
Since development Internet particular wide variety group come existence including Web IRC multiuser dimension MUDs recently commercial
The theory hypothesis group impact individual numerous
Some researcher view fast growing virtual chat clique marketplace new opportunity particularly stigmatized people take active part social life
Traditionally social isolation represented construct organized around notion person position outside refers isolation group result excluded group peer
From child adult literature show people understand concept isolation fear repercussion isolated group member
Fearing isolation people feel free speak feel hold dissenting view mean people restrict conversation individual conversation whatsoever
Witschge explained Whether fear harming others fear get harmed oneself factor inhibit people speaking freely thus result type discussion hinders diversity equality participant viewpoint arise fully
The medium Internet power free people fear social isolation shuts spiral silence
The Internet allows people find place find group people like mindset similar point view
Van Alstyne Brynjolfsson stated Internet user seek interaction individual similar value thus become le likely trust important decision people whose value differ
The feature Internet could bring people deliberate freeing people psychological barrier also bring new possibility make manageable discussion deliberation
Unlike limit participation Internet brings characteristic empowerment enormous scale available information specific audience targeted effectively people brought together medium
The Internet place many available similar view
It become place appears people le fear isolation
One research article examined individual willingness speak opinion online offline
Through survey result participant comparison contrast online offline spiral silence behavior determined
Liu Fahmy stated easy quit online discussion without pressure complying majority group
This say spiral silence occur online environment
People still le likely speak even online setting dominant opinion differs
But people online environment speak someone reference group speaks
In online situation one person encourage minority point view put end spiral silence
Another reason spiral silence theory le effect online could study acknowledge whether person likely speak dominant view offline well
The person might characteristic make comfortable speaking dominant view offline make comfortable speaking online setting
Even though research suggests chance people speak opinion often online setting silencing view still occur
Another research article examined influence different opinion climate opinion congruence majority forum participant website source found personal opinion congruence influential online site forum situated
Gonzenbach Nekmat said might worth researching whether factor study factor cause people comfortable come speaking mind online
The nature Internet facilitates participation people also heterogeneous group people
Page stated The onward rush electronic communication technology presumably increase diversity available idea speed ease fly compete
The reason people engage deliberation difference Internet allows difference easily found
The Internet seems perfect place find different view diverse group people time open difference disagreement needed deliberation
initial idea cowering muted citizen difficult reconcile empirical study documenting uninhibited discussion context newsgroups
The Internet provides anonymous setting argued anonymous setting fear isolation humiliation would reduced
Wallace recognized people believe action attributed personally tend become le inhibited restraint
This positive particularly people offered opportunity discus difficult personal issue condition feel safer
The group ability taunt individual lessened Internet thus reducing tendency conform
Wallace go summarize number empirical study find dissenter feel liberated express view online offline might result fact person minority would endure taunt ridicule people making majority made feel uncomfortable different opinion
considered absence cue lead lowered sense social presence heightened sense anonymity free people psychological barrier keep engaging deliberation
The crux spiral silence people believe consciously subconsciously expression unpopular opinion lead negative repercussion
These belief may exist Internet several reason
First embarrassment humiliation depends physical presence others
In physical isolation often already exists pose threat
Second great deal communicated nonverbal cue communication typically precludes many cue
Third Keisler Siegel McQuire observe nonverbal cue convey formality status inequality
When cue removed importance source influence recedes
Group hierarchy develop interaction emerge le clearly mediated environment
The form consequence influence undergo significant change given interposition medium reduces participant
Social presence defined degree person interaction degree medium conveys person presence
An important issue obtaining heterogeneity conversation equal access participant influence discussion
When people believe ignorant topic incapable participate discussion equal peer tend even become involved
When people decide participate participation might overruled contribution might valued le depending status
Dahlberg praise Internet possibility liberate people power relation exist offline The bodily identity supposed allow people interact equal
Arguments said assessed value claim poster
Gastil see feature one strongest point Internet interaction consistently reduce independent influence status powerful advantage deliberation
While status cue difficult detect perception status converge lessens
It may people feel equal online forum feel offline
kind group seems diminishing cue status obvious
Next Internet rapidly dramatically increased capacity develop realizing equality
The relationship perception public opinion willingness mainly measured In survey respondent often asked whether would reveal opinion given hypothetical situation right opinion public opinion opinion received
Whether asking hypothetical question reflect real life case questioned communication scholar leading criticism able capture respondent would situation
A research study addressed criticism comparatively testing spiral model hypothetical survey
The finding line critic hypothetical survey question demonstrating significant increase spiral silence focus group
Among different approach survey methodology design leading method employed analyze test theory
design involves analysis relationship public opinion willingness speak one point time
While many research employ design scholar employed
Under methodology three specific approach used
tested theory aggregate level
Using approach change process observed comparing absolute share people perceiving majority climate people willing express view time
The second approach used Spiral Silence research conducting separate regression panel survey wave
The drawback approach individual change climate opinion perception ignored
The last approach scholar used conducting Spiral Silence research use changed score dependent variable
However intuitive approach may lead difficulty respect statistical property regression mean negative correlation change score time one state
The critic theory often claim individual different influence affect whether speak
Research indicates people fear isolation small social circle population large
Within large nation one always find group people share one opinion however people fear isolation close family friend theory
Research demonstrated fear isolation stronger fear isolated entire public typically measured
Scholars also argued personal characteristic various culture among different group influence whether person willingly speak
If one person positive lack sense shame person speak regardless perceives climate public opinion
Another influence critic give people choosing speak public opinion culture
Open expression idea forbidden culture
Some culture individualistic would support individual opinion collectivist culture support overall group opinion need
Gender also considered cultural factor
In culture woman perception language public opinion force remain quiet
Scheufele Moy assert certain conflict style cultural indicator used understand difference
Another criticism spiral silence research research design observe movement spiral time
Critics propose emphasis time formation spiral reflect methodology well dynamic nature spiral model acknowledged
They argue spiral silence theory involves time factor considering change public opinion eventually lead change people assessment public opinion
Also according Spilchal spiral silence theory ignores evidence historical development public opinion theory practice extension suffrage organisation political propaganda group establishment pressure group political party eligibility ever wider circle public official eventually installation several form direct democracy
Some scholar also provide understanding theory contemporary society pointing much actual statistical majority generates pressure conformity climate opinion conveyed large measure medium
Under great influence medium coverage climate opinion invariably accurate reflection distribution opinion within polity
Further Scheufele Moy find problem operationalization key term including willingness speak
This construct measured term actually speaking voting conceptually similar construct
Conformity experiment moral component yet morality key construct model
These conformity experiment particularly Asch form part base theory
Scholars question whether conformity experiment relevant development SOS

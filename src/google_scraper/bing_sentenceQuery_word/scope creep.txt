Want watch later
Have ever started one thing realize time later gotten track something totally different
If personally encountered something similar referred project management
Allowing wandering work effort gain traction generally counterproductive overall project delivery need managed
In order understand scope creep first understand project scope defined managed
A project consists item project required deliver along work expected order make delivery
In traditional project management practice scope project fully defined beforehand one first step taken project approved
In Agile project management environment scope determined start every iteration
Whatever methodology used important approval scope obtained prior starting associated task
The likelihood encountering scope creep becomes much greater approval obtained
In first case project manager obtain formal approval scope customer project sponsor Agile team formally accept scope part ongoing iteration planning
defined working feature functionality NOT approved authorized
Allowing scope creep occur project often mean previously approved agreed upon work suffer schedule overrun additional time added schedule account new effort
If scope creep occurs schedule held rigorously check likely quality delivery suffer attempt made cut corner order meet schedule deadline
If scope creep allowed persist throughout project delivery regular basis entire project may subject failure
Of course requirement project likely change time
When scope change actually authorized subsequently accounted associated schedule resource adjustment refer scope creep
Approval new scope outside original project charter often handled formal change control process
In Agile world scope creep detected put hold deferred effectively reviewed part subsequent iteration planning
One common example scope creep
In case manager demand piece work outside original scope delivered
For example key client may make specific demand management unplanned feature included next product delivery threat take business elsewhere demand met
Managers often respond type business pressure dictating happens next
While may practical business reason honoring client demand change still handled appropriate process simply management edict
A slightly dangerous type scope creep occur client allowed contact team member directly outside normal working relationship customer project team
In case team member may feel compelled honor direct client request may feel right thing honoring adage customer always right
This worse scope creep management edict management likely later unknown request

Scope creep also result le obvious cause
For example root cause form scope creep may due uncertainty lack specificity original project requirement
Because original requirement lack detail required actually complete delivery simply added work progress
The process iterative Agile planning degree reaction common type hidden scope creep
Scope creep also result altruistic effort individual team member
Perhaps developer software project notice something original design could improved upon realizing making change could cost multiple day rework
Or perhaps manager architect new building decides using higher cost material highly visible area make aesthetic improvement without considering full cost schedule implication decision
There many example type scope creep good intention run original project constraint
While unmanaged scope creep typically negative consequence also true creativity growth new idea often result process
The key handling scope creep find right way manage unexpected unplanned alteration project scope
Timely effective communication party involved go long way towards managing scope creep actually benefit final project delivery
result feature functionality approved allowed occur
This typically negative overall effect resulting longer schedule lower quality delivery
Some common way scope creep occur management edict allowing customer change scope without approval poor initial requirement individual team member simply trying make thing better
The first key managing scope creep initial scope agreement formally agreed
Subsequent change scope handled change management process agreed procedure dealing requested addition

Describe previous project involved scope creep occurred
Explain occurred least one way could prevented
Thank opportunity help question
Even clearly defined project scope still beware scope creep
This phenomenon generally tends occur new feature added product design already approved without providing equivalent increase budget time resource
Project Smart based United Kingdom find main cause scope creep secret managing scope creep project management daunting challenge
Since project scope often fluid nature tends morph project progress
However easily become disastrous allowed get control
For example Wikipedia list following cause scope creep Managing scope creep project management achievable
A recent article Tech Republic CBS Interactive website provides following guideline set successfully control scope project
Be sure thoroughly understand project vision
Meet project driver deliver overview project whole review comment

Understand priority priority project driver
Make ordered list refer throughout project duration
Items include budget deadline feature delivery customer satisfaction employee satisfaction
use list justify scheduling decision project commenced

Define deliverable approved project driver
Deliverables general description functionality outlined project

Break approved deliverable actual work requirement
The requirement detailed necessary completed using simple spreadsheet
The larger project detail include
If project span month two forget include time software upgrade development always include time ample documentation

Break project major minor milestone complete generous project schedule approved project driver
Minor milestone span month
Whatever method determining task duration leave room error
When working unknown staff I generally schedule duration expected delivered
If schedule tight reevaluate deliverable
Coming budget ahead schedule leaf room additional enhancement

Once schedule created assign resource determine critical path using project evaluation review technique PERT chart work breakdown structure
Your critical path change course project important evaluate development begin
Follow map determine deliverable must completed time
In large project try define phase specific early even general plan give backbone need successful delivery

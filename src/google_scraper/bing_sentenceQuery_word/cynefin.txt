discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Computer science also strong connection discipline

Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch

Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


It Kaizen Camp I first learned Cynefin framework
The first thing might wondering heck pronounce
I know first question
It
The word Welsh origin coined Dave Snowden
In simplest term Cynefin framework exists help u realize situation created equal help u understand different situation require different response successfully navigate
Different problem warrant different solution How often seen someone try handle difficult situation way really confused failed
If could really benefit introduction Cynefin framework
Dave Snowden released CC BY You see diagram domain
What
You see four
Don forget dark mass Disorder center
Cynefin categorizes problem The boundary domain hard
Based activity situation bounce domain live borderland two domain
So framework tell u approach set different situation characteristic also explain enough help u recognize situation currently reside
You great solution applied incorrect context worthless worse harmful
This framework useful management people useful software developer human
This applied many different vector life experience
The net takeaway need pair right approach corresponding situation achieve optimal outcome
I like suggest another great article added reading listt The new dynamic strategy complex complicated world published Snowden Kurtz IBM Systems Journal
The download link
I found really useful explaining framework depth dynamic difference categorization
It great want understand Cynefin beyond basic HBR article
It overlap The Origins Cynefin paper already mentioned
Thank Article download Link Azheglov
Much appreciated You certainly made framework easy understand
I like writing style
Thank Ps
I still pronounce welsh word getting Thank much simplifying Cynefin Framework additional reading material contributor help paper includes management complexity
The Link IBM Systems Journal Article gone I find public alternative
Here DOI least Hi Bruno article seems working
Take another peek see reach
Hi Julia Great article
I wondering framework used useful UX Design example could share please

Dec unique visitor Software Development Conference A note reader As per request developed set feature allow reduce noise losing sight anything important
choosing topic interested
The purpose paper introduce Cynefin model practice used address uncertainty modern world
The practice introduced used compliment traditional approach programme portfolio management
This provides comprehensive approach reflects need management ever uncertain world
We seen couple book appear issue uncertainty last decade neither comprehensive framework allows u deal increase uncertainty modern world
If anyone doubt traditional model struggling deal modern market dynamic need look demise Monitor Group
Related Vendor Content This Michael Porter father strategic analysis company used market model
His approach based rigorous analysis market force assumption lead rational structured approach would result competitive advantage
It become apparent could help explain excess profit retrospect almost useless predicting Stewart note Most successful strategy emerge action become perspicuous Lafley Martin also note simple increasingly complex global competitive world

What learnt limit rationality address uncertainty take advantage turbulence market place
When faced problem assume need elaborate option select one execute
This make assumption causality determinable therefore valid mean eliminating option
What mean causality relate cause effect take certain action know effect given effect determine caused
This always case need acknowledge system determined
We call former ordered later system
In ordered system system highly constrained behaviour highly predictable causality either obvious experience determined right expertise
If seen cause effect happening obvious simple system obvious determined analysis say complicated system cause effect determination cause separated time
For unordered system causality determined find system stable constraint behaviour evolve time interaction component
Here causality determined hindsight amount analysis allow u predict behaviour system
This domain call complex also system stable described chaotic little constraint behaviour random
There one additional domain need considered system yet determined put disorder bucket
Another definition applied system ordered taken apart put back together
For example car aeroplane unordered never deconstructed put back together
For example think making mayonnaise
We also need acknowledge system always stable state system may change time
A system may stable one day believe know work
However may find performance degrading overtime may simply break
In case former may involve expert say mechanic case car analyse going
In case later car broken thrown chaos may need involve rescue service recover vehicle take garage order mechanic undertake analysis
We moved simple driving vehicle chaotic vehicle broken complicated need mechanic return hopefully simple car working
These domain obvious complicated complex chaos along disorder yet determined domain Cynefin complexity model
It give u model allows u describe reality well practice applied manage complicated complex domain
These practice suitable complement traditional approach applicable order hold
It case old practice work realising work within certain boundary ordered space applicable
known knowns know seen thousand time sense categorise respond
Here expect see best practice employeed
known unknown know going know analyse happened work sensing analysing responding
This domain good practice
unknown unknown determine cause particular outcome run experiment see move u right direction probe sense respond
This also domain right wrong answer may want run series experiment fact run number parallel
This domain emergent practice
unknowable unknown system stable need something viable wait act something sense respond
This domain novel practice determined item yet determine domain belong
These practice summarised following table also suggests consider individual domain
This touch number practice crew alternative team social network simulation SNS indicate richness Cynefin This development original model contained November Harvard Business Review paper decision making
Let look situation see model used The first thing need differentiate order seen experience leveraged problem ordered
If seen truly novel something may better exploring first therefore treat
If time consider domain operating consider worst case simple mean ordered deal complicated engaged expert treat chaotic act attempt stabilise situation
This avoids simplifying situation fooling know answer find
There couple general point need discus move talk specifically Cynefin practice
These relate complicated complex domain issue complicated domain domain expert tendency towards group think
There value group evidenced wisdom crowd based average view group people area one key point individual allowed engage
The requirement guess disclosed estimate made isolation avoid influencing guess
This necessarily practical day day basis need effective strategy address improve information scanning
Alfred Sloan said Gentlemen I take complete agreement decision
Then I propose postpone discussion give time develop disagreement perhaps gain understanding decision
The issue group think addressed engaging diverse group individual ensuring come domain expertise therefore provide naive view
The mantra dumb question need people willing ask question
This provided engaging expert diverse domain
It worth noting Franklin D Roosevelt dragged people one meeting another bright thought would provide interest point view Decisive
Dave Snowden tell story engagement anthropologist undertake study management structure hotel chain
This gave rise interesting chapter report mating habit staff
This consider engage expert
The use also useful technique conflict resolution
The hypothesis outlined experiment run determine validate progressed
It may case opposing idea validity benefit
See portfolio form second article outlined experiment
talked clear answer complex domain mean competing view
Remember domain cause effect directly related messy coherence may able ascertain pattern forming time
We need understand accept bad sometimes need embraced
This mean looking right answer series idea tested find work one idea may viable
We mentioned complex domain domain seeking number experiment test hypothesis maximise potential learning
There good example Heath Decisive discus example largest direct car sale company America
This started experiment see people would consider buying car online response overwhelming
The initiative initially withdrawn losing money trial model based purchasing car meet order
This type issue going become common future need flexible comprehensive model
Again naivety role play assume know happen
As long someone make coherent argument thier idea value explored
The last point make need recognise value obliquity practice achieving objective indirectly
You may aware Apple focus traditional management measure us Net Promoter Score NPS ass satisfaction customer perspective
It us guide product development marketing effort
It make use traditional metric internally target
To expand I use example sailing
When sailing upwind downwind trying get next mark quickly possible common metric used indicate progress VMG velocity made good sail directly wind although sail directly downwind optimal point sail
The issue VMG direct measure take account variable play wind strength point sail etc typically use oblique measure target velocity
The boat performance characteristic used determine optimum speed given wind strength point sail
The helm steer boat based indirect measure lead optimisation VMG next mark I would expect navigator VMG instrument displayed main instrument helm obvious direct measure
What ideally want use oblique approach avoids cognitive bias come using traditional measure gamed
This explored John Kay excellent
Cynefin provides approach set practice addressing uncertainty management today increasingly facing
This provides mean realise facing messy intractable problem tool enable make progress imperfect world
This significant change traditional approach try reduce problem set rational action acknowledges instance predict outcome
Instead obsessing predicting future move position controlling future therefore need predict everything
This value Cynefin
The next paper considers practice related running experiment
experienced system technical architect specialising card payment system
He worked renewal main UK domestic clearing settlement system also similar system one major card company
It working later mid thought must effective mean delivery prevailing approach preoccupied utilisation
This led review prevailing management literature interest Theory Constraints Systems Thinking Toyota recently complexity particular Cynefin cognitive science

The used help manager others reach decision
Developed early within described device
word
Cynefin offer five context domain enable manager identify perceive situation make sense people behaviour
The framework draw research
word meaning
It carry sense physical cultural spiritual
The word similar meaning compared word place stand
The idea Cynefin framework offer sense place view perception
began work Cynefin model help manage within company
He continued developing European director IBM Institute Knowledge Management later founder director IBM Cynefin Centre Organizational Complexity established
Snowden Cynthia Kurtz IBM researcher described framework detail following year paper The new dynamic strategy complex complicated world published
The Cynefin network member partner industry government operating independently IBM
In Snowden Mary Boone described Cynefin framework
The paper A Leader Framework Decision Making Snowden Boone Outstanding Publication OB award Organizational Behavior division
Cynefin offer five context domain centre
The domain name changed year
Kurtz Snowden called
Snowden Boone changed
Since Snowden used place
These domain offer manager sense place analyse behaviour decide act similar situation
The domain right ordered cause effect known discovered
The domain left unordered cause effect deduced hindsight
The domain represents known knowns
There rule situation stable relationship cause effect clear X expect Y
The advice establish fact sense categorize respond following rule applying best practice
Snowden Boone offer example processing
An employee identifies problem example borrower paid le required categorizes review loan document responds follows term loan
According This domain legal structure standard operating procedure practice proven work
Never draw
Never lend client whose monthly payment exceed percent gross income
Never end meeting without asking sale
Here lie squarely realm reason Find proper rule apply
Snowden Boone write manager beware forcing situation domain entrained thinking blind new way thinking becoming complacent
When success breed complacency best practice definition past practice catastrophic clockwise shift chaotic domain
They recommend leader provide communication channel necessary anonymous one dissenter example within workforce warn complacency
The domain consists known unknown
The relationship cause effect requires analysis expertise range right answer
The framework recommends ass fact analyze apply appropriate good operating practice
Stewart writes Here possible work rationally toward decision requires refined judgment expertise

This province engineer surgeon intelligence analyst lawyer expert
Artificial intelligence cope well play chess complicated problem looking every possible sequence move
The domain represents unknown unknown
Cause effect deduced retrospect
There right answer
Instructive pattern emerge write Snowden Boone leader conduct experiment safe fail
Cynefin call process
Hard insurance case one example domain
Hard case need human underwriter Stewart writes best thing Dump file spread content
Snowden Boone write In complicated context least one right answer exists
In complex context however right answer ferreted
It like difference say Ferrari Brazilian rainforest
Ferraris complicated machine expert mechanic take one apart reassemble without changing thing
The car static whole sum part
The rainforest hand constant specie becomes extinct weather pattern change agricultural project reroutes water whole far sum part
Stewart identifies battlefield market ecosystem corporate culture complex system impervious reductionist approach action change situation unpredictable way
In domain cause effect unclear
Events domain confusing wait response writes Patrick Lambe
first way respond appropriately
In context manager establish order stability lie turn chaotic complex
Snowden Boone write In chaotic domain leader immediate job discover pattern staunch bleeding
A leader must first act establish order sense stability present absent respond working transform situation chaos complexity identification emerging pattern help prevent future crisis discern new opportunity
Communication direct broadcast kind imperative simply time ask input
The example category
Stewart offer others firefighter whose gut make turn left trader instinctively sell news stock seems good true
One said People afraid

paralyzed
You got quick little step know succeed begin tell story make sense
Snowden Boone give example robber murdered seven employee Brown Chicken Pasta situation local police faced domain
Deputy Police Chief Walt Gasior act immediately stem early panic keeping department running calling expert maintaining community confidence following week
The dark domain centre represents situation clarity domain apply
By definition hard see domain applies
Here multiple perspective jostle prominence factional leader argue one another cacophony rule write Snowden Boone
The way realm break situation constituent part assign one four realm
Leaders make decision intervene contextually appropriate way
As knowledge increase clockwise drift
Similarly buildup bias complacency lack maintenance cause catastrophic failure clockwise movement represented fold domain
There movement people die knowledge forgotten new generation question rule push occur lack order cause rule imposed suddenly
Cynefin used IBM developer product development market creation
Later us include analysing impact religion policymaking within administration military management risk United States policing United States
It also used research including examine complexity care British nature knowledge health care fight South Africa
In RAND Corporation used cynefin framework discussion theory model decision making
Criticism Cynefin includes framework difficult confusing need rigorous foundation cover limited selection possible context
Another criticism term ambiguous

Inspire team resource help develop skill become effective workplace

Are management role technical ability
Find iStockphoto Make best move Cynefin framework
The effective leader understand problem solving process
They know action depend situation make better decision adapting approach changing circumstance
But know approach use particular situation
And avoid making wrong decision
In article look Cynefin framework tool help make better decision assessing situation find
Cynefin pronounced Welsh word translates place habitat
However also used describe element situation personal history influence thought decision way understand
Scholar David Snowden used word describe framework developed based concept organizational strategy
Along colleague Mary Boone published framework November issue
The Cynefin framework Figure tool help put situation five domain defined relationship
This help ass situation accurately respond appropriately
Based Cynefin framework diagram David Snowden see
Reproduced permission
The obvious domain originally called simple updated
You use Cynefin framework variety situation categorize problem decision respond accordingly
For example useful product development marketing organizational strategy
It also help make better decision crisis emergency
It help avoid using management style approach situation mistake costly team encouraging flexible adaptable making decision adjust management style fit circumstance
Let look five domain greater detail
In obvious context option clear relationship apparent everyone involved
Here often explicit step place dictate next stage process
For example problem encountered help desk call center often predictable process place handle
Snowden argues need Sense Categorize Respond obvious decision
Put simply ass situation categorize type base response best practice
There often one established correct answer based existing process procedure
However danger obvious context may oversimplified
This often happens leader entire organization experience success become complacent
To avoid make sure clear communication channel place team member report situation fit established category
Another challenge leader may receptive new idea past experience success
For example people might automatically assume previous solution work
To overcome stay open new idea willing pursue innovative suggestion
Complicated problem might several correct solution
Here clear relationship cause effect may visible everyone problem complicated
For example might see several symptom problem know fix
The approach Sense Analyze Respond
In word need ass situation analyze known often help expert decide best response using good practice
Leaders may rely heavily expert complicated situation dismissing overlooking creative solution people
To overcome assemble team people wide variety background including dissenter use tool ensure everyone view heard
It might impossible identify one correct solution spot relationship complex situation
According Snowden Boone many business situation fall category
Complex context often unpredictable best approach Probe Sense Respond
Rather trying control situation insisting plan action often best patient look pattern encourage solution emerge
It helpful conduct situation accept failure part learning process
Make sure process place guide team thinking even simple set rule lead better solution guidance
Communication essential
Gather diverse group people come innovative creative solution complex problem
Use brainstorming tool generate new idea encourage team debate possibility
Complicated complex situation similar way challenging tell experiencing
However need make decision based incomplete data example likely complex situation

In chaotic situation relationship cause effect exists primary goal establish order stability
Crisis emergency scenario often fall domain
The approach Act Sense Respond
You need act decisively address pressing issue sense stability respond move situation chaos complexity
To navigate chaotic situation successfully conduct identify possible risk prioritize make sure comprehensive place
It impossible prepare every situation planning identifiable risk often helpful
Reliable information critical uncertain chaotic situation make sure know
It extremely difficult identify disorder situation
Here clear four domain dominant people generally rely technique known comfortable
Your primary goal situation move known domain take appropriate action
José team recently rolled innovative new
However developed issue one agree causing
Dissatisfied customer returning product company reputation taken hit
José managing number issue
He help team uncover cause problem fixed working marketing compensate customer answering question medium issue
He us Cynefin framework gain better understanding situation categorizes complicated mean need take Sense Analyze Respond approach
So brings expert research development IT manufacturing help diagnose problem
Working closely team expert list quality concern focus one individually find root cause problem
After several day analysis everyone agrees problem caused dry solder joint
Working together consultant José team come clear plan address ensure faulty shipped
The Cynefin framework developed David Snowden
It aim help leader understand every situation different requires unique approach decision making
The framework outline five situational domain defined relationship
They Each domain specific approach help make better sense situation choose appropriate way forward

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Computer science also strong connection discipline

This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


It Kaizen Camp I first learned Cynefin framework
The first thing might wondering heck pronounce
I know first question
It
The word Welsh origin coined Dave Snowden
In simplest term Cynefin framework exists help u realize situation created equal help u understand different situation require different response successfully navigate
Different problem warrant different solution How often seen someone try handle difficult situation way really confused failed
If could really benefit introduction Cynefin framework
Dave Snowden released CC BY You see diagram domain
What
You see four
Don forget dark mass Disorder center
Cynefin categorizes problem The boundary domain hard
Based activity situation bounce domain live borderland two domain
So framework tell u approach set different situation characteristic also explain enough help u recognize situation currently reside
You great solution applied incorrect context worthless worse harmful
This framework useful management people useful software developer human
This applied many different vector life experience
The net takeaway need pair right approach corresponding situation achieve optimal outcome
I like suggest another great article added reading listt The new dynamic strategy complex complicated world published Snowden Kurtz IBM Systems Journal
The download link
I found really useful explaining framework depth dynamic difference categorization
It great want understand Cynefin beyond basic HBR article
It overlap The Origins Cynefin paper already mentioned
Thank Article download Link Azheglov
Much appreciated You certainly made framework easy understand
I like writing style
Thank Ps
I still pronounce welsh word getting Thank much simplifying Cynefin Framework additional reading material contributor help paper includes management complexity
The Link IBM Systems Journal Article gone I find public alternative
Here DOI least Hi Bruno article seems working
Take another peek see reach
Hi Julia Great article
I wondering framework used useful UX Design example could share please

Dec unique visitor Software Development Conference A note reader As per request developed set feature allow reduce noise losing sight anything important
choosing topic interested
The purpose paper introduce Cynefin model practice used address uncertainty modern world
The practice introduced used compliment traditional approach programme portfolio management
This provides comprehensive approach reflects need management ever uncertain world
We seen couple book appear issue uncertainty last decade neither comprehensive framework allows u deal increase uncertainty modern world
If anyone doubt traditional model struggling deal modern market dynamic need look demise Monitor Group
Related Vendor Content This Michael Porter father strategic analysis company used market model
His approach based rigorous analysis market force assumption lead rational structured approach would result competitive advantage
It become apparent could help explain excess profit retrospect almost useless predicting Stewart note Most successful strategy emerge action become perspicuous Lafley Martin also note simple increasingly complex global competitive world

What learnt limit rationality address uncertainty take advantage turbulence market place
When faced problem assume need elaborate option select one execute
This make assumption causality determinable therefore valid mean eliminating option
What mean causality relate cause effect take certain action know effect given effect determine caused
This always case need acknowledge system determined
We call former ordered later system
In ordered system system highly constrained behaviour highly predictable causality either obvious experience determined right expertise
If seen cause effect happening obvious simple system obvious determined analysis say complicated system cause effect determination cause separated time
For unordered system causality determined find system stable constraint behaviour evolve time interaction component
Here causality determined hindsight amount analysis allow u predict behaviour system
This domain call complex also system stable described chaotic little constraint behaviour random
There one additional domain need considered system yet determined put disorder bucket
Another definition applied system ordered taken apart put back together
For example car aeroplane unordered never deconstructed put back together
For example think making mayonnaise
We also need acknowledge system always stable state system may change time
A system may stable one day believe know work
However may find performance degrading overtime may simply break
In case former may involve expert say mechanic case car analyse going
In case later car broken thrown chaos may need involve rescue service recover vehicle take garage order mechanic undertake analysis
We moved simple driving vehicle chaotic vehicle broken complicated need mechanic return hopefully simple car working
These domain obvious complicated complex chaos along disorder yet determined domain Cynefin complexity model
It give u model allows u describe reality well practice applied manage complicated complex domain
These practice suitable complement traditional approach applicable order hold
It case old practice work realising work within certain boundary ordered space applicable
known knowns know seen thousand time sense categorise respond
Here expect see best practice employeed
known unknown know going know analyse happened work sensing analysing responding
This domain good practice
unknown unknown determine cause particular outcome run experiment see move u right direction probe sense respond
This also domain right wrong answer may want run series experiment fact run number parallel
This domain emergent practice
unknowable unknown system stable need something viable wait act something sense respond
This domain novel practice determined item yet determine domain belong
These practice summarised following table also suggests consider individual domain
This touch number practice crew alternative team social network simulation SNS indicate richness Cynefin This development original model contained November Harvard Business Review paper decision making
Let look situation see model used The first thing need differentiate order seen experience leveraged problem ordered
If seen truly novel something may better exploring first therefore treat
If time consider domain operating consider worst case simple mean ordered deal complicated engaged expert treat chaotic act attempt stabilise situation
This avoids simplifying situation fooling know answer find
There couple general point need discus move talk specifically Cynefin practice
These relate complicated complex domain issue complicated domain domain expert tendency towards group think
There value group evidenced wisdom crowd based average view group people area one key point individual allowed engage
The requirement guess disclosed estimate made isolation avoid influencing guess
This necessarily practical day day basis need effective strategy address improve information scanning
Alfred Sloan said Gentlemen I take complete agreement decision
Then I propose postpone discussion give time develop disagreement perhaps gain understanding decision
The issue group think addressed engaging diverse group individual ensuring come domain expertise therefore provide naive view
The mantra dumb question need people willing ask question
This provided engaging expert diverse domain
It worth noting Franklin D Roosevelt dragged people one meeting another bright thought would provide interest point view Decisive
Dave Snowden tell story engagement anthropologist undertake study management structure hotel chain
This gave rise interesting chapter report mating habit staff
This consider engage expert
The use also useful technique conflict resolution
The hypothesis outlined experiment run determine validate progressed
It may case opposing idea validity benefit
See portfolio form second article outlined experiment
talked clear answer complex domain mean competing view
Remember domain cause effect directly related messy coherence may able ascertain pattern forming time
We need understand accept bad sometimes need embraced
This mean looking right answer series idea tested find work one idea may viable
We mentioned complex domain domain seeking number experiment test hypothesis maximise potential learning
There good example Heath Decisive discus example largest direct car sale company America
This started experiment see people would consider buying car online response overwhelming
The initiative initially withdrawn losing money trial model based purchasing car meet order
This type issue going become common future need flexible comprehensive model
Again naivety role play assume know happen
As long someone make coherent argument thier idea value explored
The last point make need recognise value obliquity practice achieving objective indirectly
You may aware Apple focus traditional management measure us Net Promoter Score NPS ass satisfaction customer perspective
It us guide product development marketing effort
It make use traditional metric internally target
To expand I use example sailing
When sailing upwind downwind trying get next mark quickly possible common metric used indicate progress VMG velocity made good sail directly wind although sail directly downwind optimal point sail
The issue VMG direct measure take account variable play wind strength point sail etc typically use oblique measure target velocity
The boat performance characteristic used determine optimum speed given wind strength point sail
The helm steer boat based indirect measure lead optimisation VMG next mark I would expect navigator VMG instrument displayed main instrument helm obvious direct measure
What ideally want use oblique approach avoids cognitive bias come using traditional measure gamed
This explored John Kay excellent
Cynefin provides approach set practice addressing uncertainty management today increasingly facing
This provides mean realise facing messy intractable problem tool enable make progress imperfect world
This significant change traditional approach try reduce problem set rational action acknowledges instance predict outcome
Instead obsessing predicting future move position controlling future therefore need predict everything
This value Cynefin
The next paper considers practice related running experiment
experienced system technical architect specialising card payment system
He worked renewal main UK domestic clearing settlement system also similar system one major card company
It working later mid thought must effective mean delivery prevailing approach preoccupied utilisation
This led review prevailing management literature interest Theory Constraints Systems Thinking Toyota recently complexity particular Cynefin cognitive science

The used help manager others reach decision
Developed early within described device
word
Cynefin offer five context domain enable manager identify perceive situation make sense people behaviour
The framework draw research
word meaning
It carry sense physical cultural spiritual
The word similar meaning compared word place stand
The idea Cynefin framework offer sense place view perception
began work Cynefin model help manage within company
He continued developing European director IBM Institute Knowledge Management later founder director IBM Cynefin Centre Organizational Complexity established
Snowden Cynthia Kurtz IBM researcher described framework detail following year paper The new dynamic strategy complex complicated world published
The Cynefin network member partner industry government operating independently IBM
In Snowden Mary Boone described Cynefin framework
The paper A Leader Framework Decision Making Snowden Boone Outstanding Publication OB award Organizational Behavior division
Cynefin offer five context domain centre
The domain name changed year
Kurtz Snowden called
Snowden Boone changed
Since Snowden used place
These domain offer manager sense place analyse behaviour decide act similar situation
The domain right ordered cause effect known discovered
The domain left unordered cause effect deduced hindsight
The domain represents known knowns
There rule situation stable relationship cause effect clear X expect Y
The advice establish fact sense categorize respond following rule applying best practice
Snowden Boone offer example processing
An employee identifies problem example borrower paid le required categorizes review loan document responds follows term loan
According This domain legal structure standard operating procedure practice proven work
Never draw
Never lend client whose monthly payment exceed percent gross income
Never end meeting without asking sale
Here lie squarely realm reason Find proper rule apply
Snowden Boone write manager beware forcing situation domain entrained thinking blind new way thinking becoming complacent
When success breed complacency best practice definition past practice catastrophic clockwise shift chaotic domain
They recommend leader provide communication channel necessary anonymous one dissenter example within workforce warn complacency
The domain consists known unknown
The relationship cause effect requires analysis expertise range right answer
The framework recommends ass fact analyze apply appropriate good operating practice
Stewart writes Here possible work rationally toward decision requires refined judgment expertise

This province engineer surgeon intelligence analyst lawyer expert
Artificial intelligence cope well play chess complicated problem looking every possible sequence move
The domain represents unknown unknown
Cause effect deduced retrospect
There right answer
Instructive pattern emerge write Snowden Boone leader conduct experiment safe fail
Cynefin call process
Hard insurance case one example domain
Hard case need human underwriter Stewart writes best thing Dump file spread content
Snowden Boone write In complicated context least one right answer exists
In complex context however right answer ferreted
It like difference say Ferrari Brazilian rainforest
Ferraris complicated machine expert mechanic take one apart reassemble without changing thing
The car static whole sum part
The rainforest hand constant specie becomes extinct weather pattern change agricultural project reroutes water whole far sum part
Stewart identifies battlefield market ecosystem corporate culture complex system impervious reductionist approach action change situation unpredictable way
In domain cause effect unclear
Events domain confusing wait response writes Patrick Lambe
first way respond appropriately
In context manager establish order stability lie turn chaotic complex
Snowden Boone write In chaotic domain leader immediate job discover pattern staunch bleeding
A leader must first act establish order sense stability present absent respond working transform situation chaos complexity identification emerging pattern help prevent future crisis discern new opportunity
Communication direct broadcast kind imperative simply time ask input
The example category
Stewart offer others firefighter whose gut make turn left trader instinctively sell news stock seems good true
One said People afraid

paralyzed
You got quick little step know succeed begin tell story make sense
Snowden Boone give example robber murdered seven employee Brown Chicken Pasta situation local police faced domain
Deputy Police Chief Walt Gasior act immediately stem early panic keeping department running calling expert maintaining community confidence following week
The dark domain centre represents situation clarity domain apply
By definition hard see domain applies
Here multiple perspective jostle prominence factional leader argue one another cacophony rule write Snowden Boone
The way realm break situation constituent part assign one four realm
Leaders make decision intervene contextually appropriate way
As knowledge increase clockwise drift
Similarly buildup bias complacency lack maintenance cause catastrophic failure clockwise movement represented fold domain
There movement people die knowledge forgotten new generation question rule push occur lack order cause rule imposed suddenly
Cynefin used IBM developer product development market creation
Later us include analysing impact religion policymaking within administration military management risk United States policing United States
It also used research including examine complexity care British nature knowledge health care fight South Africa
In RAND Corporation used cynefin framework discussion theory model decision making
Criticism Cynefin includes framework difficult confusing need rigorous foundation cover limited selection possible context
Another criticism term ambiguous

Inspire team resource help develop skill become effective workplace
View Corporate Solutions
The Cornell System great way organizing note iStockphoto Make best move Cynefin framework
The effective leader understand problem solving process
They know action depend situation make better decision adapting approach changing circumstance
But know approach use particular situation
And avoid making wrong decision
In article look Cynefin framework tool help make better decision assessing situation find
Cynefin pronounced Welsh word translates place habitat
However also used describe element situation personal history influence thought decision way understand
Scholar David Snowden used word describe framework developed based concept organizational strategy
Along colleague Mary Boone published framework November issue
The Cynefin framework Figure tool help put situation five domain defined relationship
This help ass situation accurately respond appropriately
Based Cynefin framework diagram David Snowden see
Reproduced permission
The obvious domain originally called simple updated
You use Cynefin framework variety situation categorize problem decision respond accordingly
For example useful product development marketing organizational strategy
It also help make better decision crisis emergency
It help avoid using management style approach situation mistake costly team encouraging flexible adaptable making decision adjust management style fit circumstance
Let look five domain greater detail
In obvious context option clear relationship apparent everyone involved
Here often explicit step place dictate next stage process
For example problem encountered help desk call center often predictable process place handle
Snowden argues need Sense Categorize Respond obvious decision
Put simply ass situation categorize type base response best practice
There often one established correct answer based existing process procedure
However danger obvious context may oversimplified
This often happens leader entire organization experience success become complacent
To avoid make sure clear communication channel place team member report situation fit established category
Another challenge leader may receptive new idea past experience success
For example people might automatically assume previous solution work
To overcome stay open new idea willing pursue innovative suggestion
Complicated problem might several correct solution
Here clear relationship cause effect may visible everyone problem complicated
For example might see several symptom problem know fix
The approach Sense Analyze Respond
In word need ass situation analyze known often help expert decide best response using good practice
Leaders may rely heavily expert complicated situation dismissing overlooking creative solution people
To overcome assemble team people wide variety background including dissenter use tool ensure everyone view heard
It might impossible identify one correct solution spot relationship complex situation
According Snowden Boone many business situation fall category
Complex context often unpredictable best approach Probe Sense Respond
Rather trying control situation insisting plan action often best patient look pattern encourage solution emerge
It helpful conduct situation accept failure part learning process
Make sure process place guide team thinking even simple set rule lead better solution guidance
Communication essential
Gather diverse group people come innovative creative solution complex problem
Use brainstorming tool generate new idea encourage team debate possibility
Complicated complex situation similar way challenging tell experiencing
However need make decision based incomplete data example likely complex situation

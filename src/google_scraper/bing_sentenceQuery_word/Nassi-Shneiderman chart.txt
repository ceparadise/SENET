Visualization Visual Communication Programming language use word symbol represent structure like block condition
A visual representation structure seems useful keep track different case see scope variable etc
diagram offer representation
The structure program sometimes shown using flow chart decision create branch repetition seen arrow point back etc
Flow chart adequate representation assembly language program poor fit structured programming language almost everybody using many decade
In Isaac Nassi described idea structured visual approach
Their diagram sometimes called much commonly known For reason caught much world elsewhere
I remember taught diagram much better suited structured programming flowchart high school
As teenager I drew good number diagram sorting algorithm particular confusing figure worked
Structured flowchart interesting property
They much better structural fit programming language standard flow chart
language like C Pascal Java Python etc
construct like loop block define scope ifs defined else structure often cascading structure statement function call including recursion etc
Assembly thing know conditional unconditional jump
Those nicely captured flow chart whether jump part loop condition apparent looking larger structure program
A diagram immediately show construct
By keeping structure compact structured flowchart also help see missing case
Granted practical debugging complex program though could automated tool existed great teaching beginning programmer increase understanding going reduce frustration random guessing trying fix thing
It hard find example diagram web
Here function printing I grabbed
It fairly easy figure different element mean context
There short helpful well though link dead
helpful illustration well

His research focus communication data using visualization
In addition blogging Robert also
Thanks turning
I try
My first impression take le space look neat traditional flow chart
Also look like many decision chart tree get tiny
FYI I use flow chart I think work really well I recommend Just personal note I connected Gliffy company way
Took second understand Fibonacci diagram click really turn simple effective way explaining program
Macro diagram Word Copyright Robert Kosara All original material available

In Nassi Shneiderman proposed new form flowchart advocated better suited practice structured programming
It argued chart chart provide convenient common framework communication practice widely accepted idea concerning software development
They example used promote design structured implementation thorough testing graphical documentation

I learned Structured Programming course never saw used thereafter either analysis phase documentation purpose
Not even highly structured language like Pascal Delphi
Does actually use diagram
If yes tool use
Or never heard
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Heard diagram although I use
I ca help posting link rejection letter Nassi Shneiderman received Communications ACM first proposed diagram We never used
Yes I heard
Thanks asking
Seriously use
We ususally keep diagraming simple flow diagram generally easier read understand
I heard read book used extensively
I quickly concluded even assembly language MIXAL Knuth book understandable
I never even slightest urge draw one ca recall anybody ever asked either
I used
But often I use kind pseudocode designing algorithm
You write pseudocode editor combination
Diagrams often harder edit tend get messy
I still use UML diagram OO design
Mostly class sometimes state transition diagram class complex state
I thought cool I came across notation early
But close normal code cumbersome maintain diagram code I decided using indented code close enough taste
Yes I used year ago time UML appear little bit old fashioned
In opinion still good diagram type visualize structured code block far better
On side might easier simply direct look code You find commercial tool When I first college one lesson thing
winner certain issue highlighted
Conditionals subdividing width page quickly became impractical proposed might use representation like repetition
Also line box seemed redundant degree
Think realise leaning towards basically indented structured pseudocode limited use drawn line one side highlight indentation accurately reinforce pretence diagram
Many year ago I worked US DOT Transportation System Center I given task developing editor used document software design within department
Personally I never used
I prefer look code

By Nicholas Hebb Occasionally I get asked FlowBreeze create diagram
Short answer No
However make using shape drawing tool Excel
free tool available online already Microsoft Excel hopefully short tutorial save download install specialized software
FlowBreeze flowchart Microsoft Excel make creating flowchart simple pain free
Free Trial
diagram aka NS diagram structograms used outline structured program
They common industry today sometimes used computer science teaching tool often alternate flowchart
A simple example shown
Sample diagram In context statement branch loop
Binary branch statement statement choice
Multiple branch statement
The default case short leg triangle
Loop precondition loop loop Loop postcondition loop
Adding bunch shape diagram fairly straightforward
Well except Branch triangle pain
We show
Since default shape style Excel dark blue centered text create baseline shape plain styling place side copy paste build diagram
Before adding shape first step create grid turn Snap Grid
These step covered article wo repeat
Click Insert tab click Shapes dropdown select either Rectangle Basic Shapes group Process shape Flowchart group
Use left mouse button draw size sheet
With shape still selected shape select Format Shape context menu
Follow step set styling There several triangle shape available Excel one suitable Isoceles Triangle Basic Shapes group
It adjustment handle covered Adjusting Branch Shapes let move center vertex making switch branch
There one problem though
It point upward rotate shape text upside
So create branch shape use borderless transparent textbox top
Triangle Textbox Grouping Triangle Textbox Grouping shape together let treat multiple shape single object want use contrived branch block
Final Edit Once shape grouped select individual shape within group first clicking group select clicking individual shape
Do select textbox
textbox use Format Shape dialog change Fill None Line Color No line
You reusable branch element
Now created base shape creating diagram matter copying pasting baseline shape
Of course need position size shape build diagram
You also need set triangle adjust vertex branch statement properly positioned top process block covered Editing tip section
In Excel shape altered display yellow adjustment handle adjustment point
You click drag point change shape shape speak
Triangle adjustment Adjustment result When dealing branch loop test often necessary change stacking shape bringing forward sending backward
The easiest way right click shape use Bring Front Send Back context menu
But following keyboard shortcut useful shape hard select mouse
The shortcut look odd compared keyboard shortcut hold Alt key Excel hightlights screen making path becomes obvious
The letter map character word even though underlined like menu system
For example Send Back age Layout rrange S nd Backward Send Bac
You select shape mouse use Tab key toggle selected shape
To select multiple shape click first shape hold Shift key click others
You also use special Select Objects cursor available Home tab Find Select menu
You need toggle cursor resume normal mouse usage via menu anywhere worksheet
Clicking dragging mouse obvious way also use keyboard arrow key move shape around
With Snap Grid shape snap next cell
On Home tab use standard horizontal vertical text alignment button
On View tab uncheck Gridlines checkbox
Starting Excel copy operation place image copied range onto Windows clipboard
To save diagram image select cell fully encompassing diagram copy paste image editor even MS Paint suffice
Alternately paste Word
I recommend Paste Special choosing Enhanced Metafile format
Metafiles like vector graphic resize image line text still render nicely
Lastly save PDF
Excel problem saving shape PDF
I recommend read article Nicholas Hebb owner BreezeTree Software maker maker auditing productivity toolset Microsoft Excel
Spreadspeed time saving Excel performing operation workbook worksheet range table text number date data
The Spreadspeed auditing feature set risk assessment error reduction tool ensuring quality spreadsheet
FlowBreeze Excel automates step create flowchart
It simplifies task creating flowchart converting text flowchart shape automatically applying style routing connector arrow positioning symbol much

In article Flowchart technique structured programming presented meeting Ben Shneiderman argued With advent structured programming programming method needed model computation simply ordered structure representing complete thought possibly defined term thought yet undefined
A model needed prevents unrestricted transfer control control structure closer language amenable structured programming
We present attempt model
The new model technique presented become known graphical representation design structured software
In Shneiderman continued study programmer use
In article Experimental investigation utility detailed flowchart programming Shneiderman et al
summarized origin status quo flowchart Flowcharts part computer programming since introduction computer
In Goldstein von Neumann presented system describing process using operation assertion alternative box
They felt coding begin drawing flow diagram
Prior coding algorithm identified understood
The flowchart represented high level definition solution implemented machine
Although working numerical algorithm proposed programming methodology since become standard practice computer programming field
Furthermore Shneiderman conducted experiment suggested helpful writing understanding modifying computer program
At end paper Shneiderman et al
concluded Although original intention ascertain condition detailed flowchart helpful repeated negative result led u skeptical opinion utility detailed flowchart modern programming condition
We repeatedly selected problem tried create test condition would favor flowchart group found statistically significant difference flowchart group
In case mean score group even surpassed mean flowchart group
We conjecture detailed flowchart merely redundant presentation information contained programming language statement
The flowchart may even disadvantage complete omitting declaration statement label format require many page concise programming language statement
These insight led Shneiderman development principle design

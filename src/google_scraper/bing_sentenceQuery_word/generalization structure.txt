The ability abstract generalize essential part intellectual activity
Abstraction generalization fundamental mathematics philosophy essential computer science well
The importance abstraction derived ability hide irrelevant detail use name reference object
Programming language provide abstraction procedure function module permit programmer distinguish program implemented
The primary concern user program
This contrast writer program whose primary concern implemented
Abstraction essential construction program
It place emphasis object rather represented work
Thus primary mean managing complexity large program
Of le importance generalization
While abstraction reduces complexity hiding irrelevant detail generalization reduces complexity replacing multiple entity perform similar function single construct
Programming language provide generalization variable parameterization generic polymorphism
Generalization essential construction program
It place emphasis similarity object
Thus help manage complexity collecting individual group providing representative used specify individual group
Abstraction generalization often used together
Abstracts generalized parameterization provide greater utility
In parameterization one part entity replaced name new entity
The name used parameter
When parameterized abstract invoked invoked binding parameter argument
Figure summarizes notation used abstraction generalization
When abstraction fully parameterized free variable bound parameter abstraction may understood without looking beyond abstraction
Abstraction generalization depend principle referential transparency
denote name abstract
Declarations definition instance use abstraction programming language In addition naming second aspect abstraction
It abstract encapsulated detail abstract hidden name sufficient represent entity
This aspect abstraction considered detail later chapter
An object said understood without reference thing external object
We could equally well say instead name
A entity whose value fixed may vary
Names bound variable declaration statement
Among various term abstract found text
A perform binding independently combine binding produce completed set binding
Nether binding reference name used binding
Collateral binding common occur Scheme ML
The common way composing binding sequentially
A perform binding sequence occur
The effect allow later binding use binding produced earlier sequence
It must noted sequential binding permit mutually recursive definition
In Pascal constant variable procedure function binding sequential
To provide mutually recursive definition function procedure Pascal provide separation signature function procedure body mean function prototype forward declaration mutually recursive definition may constructed
A one name bound used directly indirectly binding
Programming language require declaration reference invent special mechanism handle forward reference
For dynamic data type rule relaxed permit definition pointer type
For function procedure separate declaration signature function procedure body
Pascal forward declaration function prototype typical
The declaration reference often chosen simplify construction compiler
In Java choice made simplify programmer task rather compiler permit forward reference
A module system provides way writing large program various piece program interfere another name clash also provides way hiding implementation detail
A module generally consists two part export part local part
The export part module consists language declaration symbol available use either part module module import module declaration giving symbol module available use either part module module import
The local part module consists language declaration symbol avaliable use part
The work constructing large program divided among several people must produce part whole
Each part called module programmer must able construct module without knowing internal detail part
This possible module separated interface part implementation part
The interface part describes information required use module implementation part describes implementation
This idea already present programming language manner function procedure defined
Function procedure definition usually separated two part
The first part give subprogram name parameter requirement second part describes implementation
A module generalization concept abstraction module permitted contain collection definition
An additional goal module confine change module rather throughout program
While concept module useful abstraction full advantage module gained module may written compiled possibly executed separately
In many case module able tested independently module
EXPANDTHIS
Advantages called lambda abstraction denote generalization called replacing number occurrence part The parameter said expression said
The symbol
Quantifiers used replace constant variable
The specialization elaboration generic called application take form It denotes expression B obtained lambda expression free occurences replaced name parameter abstract
The invocation abstract take form occaisionally name called whose value substituted parameter
Upon invocation abstract argument bound parameter
Figure summarizes variety notation used denote elaboration generalization
Most programming language permit implicit form generalization variable may introduced without providing invocation procedure replaces parameter argument
For example consider following psudocode program computes circumference circle The Principle Generalization make restriction parameter part entity may parameterized
Neither programming language
This emphasized following principle We use notation denote substitution
The notation read E p expression obtained E replacing free occurrence p
formed two similar factor
The factor generalize common expression The lambda expression use rewrite product The lambda expression abstracted name three argument used replace lambda expression name get expression clearly indicates similarity factor
Figure present two style block first requires definition proceed body second requires definition follow body
A program block structure consists one block
This structure typical BASIC early version COBOL
The monolithic structure suitable small program
The scope every definition entire program
Typically definition grouped one place even used different part program
A program block structure partitioned distinct block outer inclosing block one inner block body may contain additional block inner block may contain block
This structure typical FORTRAN In language subprogram procedure function separate act block
Variables declared inside subprogram local subprogram
Subprogram name part outer block thus scope entire program along global variable
All subprogram name global variable must unique
If variable local subprogram must global accessable subprogram even though used couple subprogram
A program block structure block may nested inside block restriction nesting block within body
This typical block structure language
A block located close point use
In block visibility controlled nesting
All name visible implicitly exported internally nested block
No name visible exported enclosing block
In block name visible declared enclosing block declared block declared nested block
D A name referenced within block refers name declared outside block
An block time interval block executed
The three basic block structure sufficient called PITS
These program comprehensible entirety individual programmer
However general enough large program
Large program written many individual must consist module developed tested independently module
Such programming called PITL
The scope rule module define relationship among name within partition
There four choice
implementation ease cheap generalization parameterless function
Scope range visibility name
For example national boundary may encapsulate natural language
However word used within boundary native word
They word borrowed language defined foreign language
So program
A definition introduces name boundary object
The object may contain name local definition assuming definition may nested
These name said free
The meaning assigned name found outside definition
The rule followed determining meaning free name called scope rule
It concerned name control
X X A program may composed main program execution may call subprogram turn may call subprogram
When subprogram called calling subprogram wait called subprogram terminate
Each subprogram expected eventually terminate return control calling subprogram
The execution calling subprogram resume point immediately following point call
Each subprogram may local data found
An activation record consists association variable value assigned
An activation record may created time subprogram called destroyed subprogram terminates
DYNAMIC STATIC ALLOCATION The run time environment must keep track current instruction referencing environment active waiting program subprogram terminates proper instruction data environment may selected calling subprogram
The current instruction calling subprogram maintained stack
When subprogram called address instruction following call calling program pushed stack
When subprogram terminates instruction pointer set address top stack address popped stack
The stack often called
The address current environment also maintained stack
The top stack always point current environment
When subprogram called address new environment pushed stack
When subprogram terminates stack popped revealing previous environment
The stack often called stack contains link pointer reveal dynamic history program
When programming language permit recursive procedure data structure size independent computed input data maximum storage requirement program determined compile time
This simplifies run time support required program possible statically allocate storage used program execution
argument must evaluated determine value arithmetic expression conditional expression strict second third argument since selection second third argument dependent value boolean condition first argument
Most programming language assume abstract strict parameter therefore parameter evaluated function called
This evaluation scheme called
This always desirable language provide mechanism programmer inform function evaluate parameter
Scheme provides quote operator prevent evaluation argument
Logic language like Prolog functional language language like Haskell Miranda language argument evaluated value required
This evaluation scheme called often implemented using argument evaluated first needed
Most language use strict evaluation efficient simplifies implementation parameter passing imperative programming language
evaluation coupled found imperative langauges produce unexpected result
provides parameter passing mechanism pas name based provide generality required imperative model following example show
The requires value copied generic entered copied generic generic exited
This form parameter passing often referred
The formal parameter local variable argument copied local variable entry generic copied local variable argument exit generic
The Pascal Ada example parameter may passed using copy mechanism
The value argument copied parameter entry value formal parameter copied actual parameter exit
In imperative language copying unnecessary language prohibits assignment formal parameter
In case parameter may passed reference
Ada function result example parameter may passed using copy mechanism
The value argument actual parameter copied formal parameter entry value parameter copied argument upon exit
In Pascal function name used parameter assignment may made function name
This form parameter passing often referred
When passing value result combined passing mechanism referred
Ada example parameter may passed form copy mechanism
The value actual parameter copied formal parameter entry value formal parameter copied actual parameter upon exit
The copy mechanism disadvantage
The copying large composite value array etc expensive parameter must assignable
expression file type Pascal assignable
The effect abstact surrounded block definition bind parameter argument
An parameter said passed argument address
References parameter reference argument
Assignments parmeter assignment argument
The Pascal array structure parameter passed using mechanism
A toster provides illustration effect passing reference
If argument A parameter said passed effect argument replaces parameter throughout body subroutine textual substitution suitable renaming local variable avoid conflict local variable variable occuring argument subprogram reference parameter result evaluation argument calling environment
In addition problem mechanism imperative language reference parameter present possibility
Aliasing occurs two name reference object
For example following procedure call ALLOCATION When subprogram called new uninitialized stack element pushed stack corresponding variable block
A reference variable involves inspection updating top element appropriate stack
This provides access variable closest block respect dynamic calling sequence
When subprogram terminates stack corresponding variable block popped restoring calling environment
The may implemented follows
The data section procedure associated
The activation record dynamically allocated space stack
Each recursive call associated activation record
Associated activation record point previous activation record address instruction executed upon return procedure provides access referencing environment
An activation record consists storage local variable static dynamic link return address
The runtime stack activation record local data static dynamic link
Global data value found following static chain appropriate activation record
An alternative method implementation static scope rule display
A set register hardware software contain pointer current environment
On procedure call current display pushed onto runtime stack new display constructed containing revised environment
On procedure exit display restored copy stack
There number mechanism partitioning program text
Functions procedure among common
However result still single file
When partition program text arranged separate file partition called module
Here several program partitioning mechanism
There number mechanism combining partition single program purpose compilation execution
The statement provided number language
It compiler directive directs compiler textually include named file source program
In system partition may separately compiled linking phase compiled program module linked together execution
In system missing function procedure result search missing module found executed found result error
In program construction module designer must answer following question
Modules must provide answer two question Functions procedure simple module
Their signature description body describes achieved
More typically module group component type constant variable procedure function
To present narrow interface module module make component visible outside
Such component said module
The component said inside module
The hidden component used implement exported component
Access component often qualified name
When strong safety consideration important module using component another module may required explicitly required module desired component

Generalization may defined Generalizations clearly important prevalent many discipline study
In science mathematics example statement law theorem often generalization state property hold group thing powerful generalization thing generalization applies
The search basic form matter represents physicist quest generalization applies everything physical universe
Generalizations equally important software
Much effort building software system allow part system operate general way possible
In case might mean designing system handle thing kind
For example system might expected process number line input
In case major design problem handle thing kind type
For example system might expect process input come file different format local well remote location
An approach solving problem able capture completely software idea generalization
One four form generalization
In case hierarchy commonality organized tree structured form
At root subtree found attribute behavior common descendent root
This particular kind tree structure referred hierarchy root provides general property shared descendent descendent typically add specializing property make distinct among sibling sibling descendent
The second form generalization
In case genericity commonality expressed aid parameter
Various specialization distinguished provide parameter
For example using genericity possible represent common property stack generalization stack anything anything represents parameter
Specialized form generalization stack integer stack character
The third form generalization
Polymorphism capture commonality algorithm
An algorithm may nested case statement logic test exact type object manipulating
algorithm performs operation object based exact type object
However many algorithm operation performed type object performed varies
Polymorphism allows nested logic case statement collapsed single case different object type treated uniform manner
Through mechanism called algorithm allows object determine operation perform response algorithm invocation
Thus algorithm need know exact type object
The algorithm need know object respond invocation manner
The fourth form generalization
A pattern express general solution key component relationship commonly occurring design problem
The attribute behavior individual component partially defined allow pattern interpreted applied wide range situation
For example wheeled vehicle pattern might defined term component wheel axle frame body power source
The pattern would also show component would arranged relation axle must connect two wheel
The pattern could interpreted many different way solve particular problem differ requirement speed durability payload fuel source available material factor
Example wheeled vehicle pattern automobile carriage ox cart moon buggy many others
A hierarchical organization component based relationship important device programming
While power organization fully appreciated study useful least hint role play
The figure show component typical graphical user interface system might organized
The general component Window attribute location coordinate denoting window appears screen shape height width behavior allows window repositioned resized
Specialized kind window include menu bar Frame support drawing graphical shape Canvas interactive Items maintain prescribed layout Items Panel allow scrollable display simple text TextWindow
Various kind interactive component shown specialized kind Items
A generalization specialization often said related relationship
In ference figure statement An Item Window suggests term used way
The terminology reflects specialization attribute behavior generalization
The notion hierarchy programming defined follows The common case hierarchy us tree structure organize abstraction although general organization possible
A hierarchy serf least four major purpose
First provides form knowledge representation
A higher generalized level hierarchy encodes understanding general attribute behavior possessed specialized descendent
Thus possible make statement All window resized
All window repositioned
Second name intermediate level hierarchy provide vocabulary used among developer developer domain expert knowledgeable application domain necessarily computing
This vocabulary allows discussion le ambiguous term vocabulary identify specific clearly defined concept
Third hierarchy extended adding new specialization level
These addition easier make occur within existing framework defines perhaps many attribute behavior
For example add new specialized kind Item necessary redefine attribute behavior Window Item assumed part generalized nature specialized Item added
Fourth new attribute behavior added easily proper subset specialization
For example new attribute behavior might needed Items added Item
These additional attribute behavior automatically part specialized kind Items anything else
Genericity partial generalization variously referred term generic template parameterized class generic class
The generalization partial least property captured generalization expressed term property part missing generalization
For example generic BubbleSort class capture exactly bubble sort sorting strategy
A basic step bubble sort strategy comparison A B two element sorted
This strategy captured perfectly without identifying exactly meant lt operator
In different us lt operator may take different interpretation
For example bubble sorting integer numeric interpretation applied bubble sorting character string lexicographic interpretation applied bubble sorting user defined type user defined interpretation may applied
Genericity defined follows Pictorially generic class drawn class hole
The hole also referred parameter generic class represents missing part generalization
Filling hole completes generalization
The completed generalization class object instantiated
It possible create object directly generic class generic class incomplete
Generic class may one hole parameter
One common type data organization occurs generic LookupTable maintains association value key value value identified
The fundamental operation LookupTable return value given key
Tables form could used maintain association
A generic class form shown
The two parameter generic class represent specific kind key case person name specific kind value case phone number
This combination parameter yield PhoneBook
Other combination key value would yield useful form LookupTables
Polymorphism mean generalizing algorithm
The generality achieved allowing algorithm manipulate uniformly object different classed provided algorithm us common property different class
Any object known posse required common property may manipulated algorithm
Some language require compiler able verify object posse required common property
Other language allow verification deferred risking possible error execution object discovered lacking one ofo required common property
Polymorphism defined follows Humans use polymorphism many activity
One example store clerk determnes total amount purchase
Each item purchased bar code label clerk scan passing bar code reader
The bar code reader read identifying information bar code label consults database merchandise report information cash register totaling
The clerk follows generalized algorithm might written Polymorphism enables software
New class possessing required common property handled polymorphic algorithm algorithm need changed way accomodate additional class
The true store clerk algorithm
The store clerk need additional training reprogramming new kind merchandise added inventory
A mechanism called needed implement polymorphism system
In context term binding refers association invocation made polymorphic algorithm code method implemented receiving object
Because polymorphic algorithm unaware exact class receiver binding must done dynamically invocationmay bound different method different execution depending object presented algorithm
The figure depicts act dynamic binding
In example polymorphic algorithm invokes method F one common property shared among set class
The algorithm unaware exact type object invocation directed
In example known whether object class X class Y
The dynamic binding mechanism determines type object map invocation correct method class X object class X correct method class Y object class Y
A pattern generalization solution commonly occurring kind problem
A pattern generalization pattern give immediately usable solution particular problem instead give general form solution problem particular kind
The user pattern must adapt pattern particular case hand supply missing detail given pattern
Experienced designer believed posse perhaps even intuitive subconscious level rich repertoire pattern ability recognize current problem solved adapting pattern used successfully solution one previous problem
Lacking collection previous design novice designer forced solve problem new completely unsolved problem often reinventing previous generation designer already created
Patterns recognized many level scale many discipline
In computer science large scale pattern often presented
Examples large scale pattern
Small scale pattern computing oten called represent common arrangement programming language construct
An example pattern scale counted loop early exit plan
This plan might used scan array fixed length terminate end array reached earlier given search criterion satisfied
The plan specifies initial condition arrangement element loop construct termination condition
The plan may specified graphical form mapped user different programming language
Patterns also common discipline
The author book cite part inspiration role pattern architecture building literary form
A pattern defined follows A pattern contains four essential part name problem solution consequence
The four part pattern illustrated simple pattern
The name pattern intended convey briefly succinctly subject matter pattern
For example name appropriate
The problem portion pattern identifies condition pattern applicable problem pattern solution
The problem one providing service possibly multiple client manner
The solution specifies element comprise solution individual responsibility manner collaborate achieve solution
The element pattern could given pictorial form shown figure
The pattern identifies five element pattern
The client would given responsibility generating request sent server turn performs service delivers response form reply
The responsibility conveying request reply client server assigned intermediary know connection
The client server collaborate directly connection indirectly
The collaboration element defined sequence event beginning generation request client transmission server followed generation server reply transmission client
Notice pattern specify nature service provided could name service time service location service file service security service
Also pattern specify connection implemented
The connection could memory buffer connecting two procedure within process memory buffer connecting two different process machine network link two process different machine
While detail vary pattern remains
The pattern also specifies positive negative consequence using pattern
Some positive consequence client server may implemented different machine allowing take advantage local specialized hardware software resource client server may totally largely unaware insensitive actual location server may made available many client time
Two negative consequence pattern client may left hanging request reply lost server crash client demand control service server request service
A pattern design expressed term class object
The element pattern represented class
The relationship among element defined association aggregation hierarchy
The responsibility collaboration understood term behavior class interaction maong class defined association
A pattern distinct form generalization
A pattern similar genericity partial generalization detail surpressed omitted
However genericity lead least partial code pattern need expressed code
A pattern may also use hierarchical relationship aspect relationship center pattern

I understand abstraction taking something concrete making abstract
That something may either data structure procedure
For example So question abstraction different generalization
I looking answer primarily related functional programming
However parallel programming I would like learn well
The implementation selection sort using priority queue three different interface The code also available via
Worth noticing existential type
As lukstafi already pointed abstraction similar existential quantifier generalization similar universal quantifier
Observe connection fact x implies x universe rarely generalization without abstraction even overloaded function form kind abstraction sense
Portal cake
Dessert table
The symbol based artwork
A interesting question indeed
I found topic concisely state While abstraction reduces complexity hiding irrelevant detail generalization reduces complexity replacing multiple entity perform similar function single construct
Lets take old example system manages book library
A book ton property number page weight font size cover purpose library may need We abstracted real book library took property interested u context application
Generalization hand try remove detail make functionality applicable wider generic range item
Generic container good example mindset You would want write implementation rather write List applies type like Scala
Note list remove detail operation made generically applicable type
dtldarek answer really good illustration
Based code might provide clarification
Remeber I mentioned
Of course thing library one borrow I call set object even though probably even word D All item representation database business logic probably similar
Additionally might define trait common We could write logic applies point care book magazine To summarize We stored book magazine DVDs database exact representation neither feasible necessary
We went ahead said It matter whether book magazine DVD borrowed customer
It always process
Thus operation borrowing item defining thing one borrow I going use example describe generalisation abstraction I going refer article
To knowledge official source definition abstraction generalisation programming domain Wikipedia probably closest get official definition opinion I instead used article I deem credible
The article state The concept generalization OOP mean object encapsulates common state behavior category object
So example apply generalisation shape common property type shape area perimeter
Hence generalised shape
Shape specialisation
Circle represented class follows note image taken aforementioned article Similarly working domain jet aircraft could Jet generalisation would wingspan property
A specialisation Jet could FighterJet would inherit wingspan property would property unique fighter jet
NumberOfMissiles
The article defines abstraction process identifying common pattern systematic variation abstraction represents common pattern provides mean specifying variation use Richard Gabriel In domain programming An abstract class parent class allows inheritance never instantiated
Hence example given Generalization section Shape abstract In real world never calculate area perimeter generic shape must know kind geometric shape shape eg
square circle rectangle etc
area perimeter formula
However well abstract shape encapsulates common state behavior category object case object shape
Going back example I gave Jets FighterJets Jet abstract concrete instance Jet feasible one exist real world unlike shape
real world cant hold shape hold instance shape
cube
So aircraft example Jet abstract generalisation possible concrete instance jet
Not addressing credible official source example Scala Having Abstraction Generalization executing lead Abstraction Abstraction specifying framework hiding implementation level information
Concreteness built top abstraction
It give blueprint follow implementing detail
Abstraction reduces complexity hiding low level detail
Example A wire frame model car
Generalization Generalization us relationship specialization generalization class
Common structure behaviour used specializtion generalized class
At broader level understand inheritance
Why I take term inheritance relate term well
Generalization also called relationship
Example Consider exists class named Person
A student person
A faculty person
Therefore relationship student person similarly faculty person generalization
I like offer answer greatest possible audience hence I use Lingua Franca web Javascript
Let start ordinary piece imperative code In next step I introduce important abstraction programming function
Functions abstract expression As see lot implementation detail abstracted away
Abstraction mean
Another abstraction step And another one The underlying principle clear
I still dissatisfied though work I want work every data type foldable I encompass larger domain data type nameley foldable datatypes
Generalization emphasizes commonality different type rather object entity
I achieved mean dictionary passing additional argument example
Now somewhat annoying pas type dicts around throughout code
Hence Haskell folk introduced type class um abstract type dicts So Haskell generic benefit abstraction generalization
Let explain simplest manner possible
All pretty girl female
abstraction
All pretty girl put
generalization
Abstraction usually reducing complexity eliminating unnecessary detail
For example abstract class OOP parent class contains common feature child specify exact functionality
Generalization necessarily require avoid detail rather mechanism allow applying function different argument
For instance polymorphic type functional programming language allow bother argument rather focus operation function
Similarly java generic type umbrella type function

If system support single directory file stored directory called single level directory
All file get stored root directory single directory
Although limitation system multiple user number file increased system
Since file present directory must unique name
If two user choose name file unique name rule violated
This lead conflict confusion also make system unworkable
Even difficult user remember name file number file increase

In two level directory different directory given different user
Each directory related user group file
The file stored directory must unique name file stored different user directory may similar name
This structure resolve problem name collision
The advantage two level directory structure structure resolve problem conflicting file name
The disadvantage two level directory structure structure isolates user user
This isolation advantage user completely independent

In data used particularly
Using mask multiple bit etc
set either inverted vice versa single bitwise operation
To turn certain bit operation used following
Therefore make sure bit used
To leave bit unchanged used
Example Masking higher bit lower nibble bit unchanged
More often practice bit ignored masked masked rather masked masked
There way change bit using operation
Instead used
When value ed result simply original value
However ing value guaranteed return possible turn bit using
To leave bit alone use
Example Masking higher bit lower nibble bit unchanged
It possible use bitmasks easily check state individual bit regardless bit
To turning bit using bitwise done discussed value compared
If equal bit value value bit
What make convenient necessary figure value actually
Example Querying status bit So far article covered turn bit turn bit
Sometimes really matter value must made opposite currently
This achieved using operation
return bit
Therefore two corresponding bit result one result
Therefore inversion value bit done ing
If original bit return
If original bit return
Also note masking meaning affect unmasked bit like
Example Toggling bit value To write arbitrary subset bit first write subset set high bit In programming language bit field useful way pas set named boolean argument function
For example graphic API command clear screen buffer
It clear four buffer color depth accumulation stencil buffer API author could take four argument
But call would look like descriptive
Instead four defined field bit declared Then call function look like Internally function taking bitfield like use binary extract individual bit
For example implementation might look like The advantage approach function argument overhead decreased
Since minimum datum size one byte separating option separate argument would wasting seven bit per argument would occupy stack space
Instead function typically accept one integer option bit
While elegant simplest implementation solution
A simply defined compiler would allow meaningless call even
In alternative would create class encapsulate set argument glClear could accept could cleanly encapsulated library see external link example
Masks used IP address IP ACLs Access Control Lists specify permitted denied
To configure IP address interface mask start large value left side example IP address mask
Masks IP ACLs reverse example mask
This sometimes called inverse mask
When value mask broken binary result determine address bit considered processing traffic
A indicates address bit must considered exact match mask care
This table explains concept
Mask Example network address traffic processed mask network address binary mask binary Based binary mask seen first three set must match given binary network address exactly
The last set number made care
Therefore traffic begin match since last octet care
Therefore mask network address processed
Subtract normal mask order determine ACL inverse mask
In example inverse mask determined network address normal mask
normal mask inverse mask ACL equivalent The mean
The host In given image intended placed background transparent area specified binary mask
This way intended image actually two actual image unused area given value set additional correspondent image area given pixel value bit set surrounding area value bit set
In sample right black pixel bit white pixel bit
At put image screen background program first mask screen pixel bit image mask desired coordinate using operation
This preserve background pixel transparent area reset zero bit pixel obscured overlapped image
Then program render image pixel bit combining background pixel bit using operation
This way image pixel appropriately placed keeping background surrounding pixel preserved
The result perfect compound image background
This technique used painting pointing device cursor typical videogames character bullet video titling image mixing application
Although related due used purpose technique involve image pixel mixage binary masking
To create hashing function often function used large domain
To create index output function modulo taken reduce size domain match size array however often faster many processor restrict size hash table power two size use bitmask instead

I trouble understanding point Subnet Masks
I reading nice article topic left bit confused
When I first heard Subnets explained small independent network connected main internet one point
For example office building would subnet thousand computer instead wasting thousand regular IP address
However article seems subnet collection computer IP address subnet mask used describe bit one range subnetwork
Example article So point
We still save IP address I want contact Dave Bill I still send message
How subnets make life easier contribute anything
The main benefit size routing table
Instead store entry every machine network need store entry particular subnet
For example ISP might anyone sending packet outside machine subnet need know route border
Their border router fine grained view subnet probably split many subnets know router network send packet based smaller subnet belongs
Thus subnets provides level abstraction OUTSIDE
Not INSIDE seemed expected
EDIT Here simplified example
Assume large ISP network
Within large network two smaller network
To reach system either two smaller network system outside need know address border router
Once packet reach router managing router know get
Finally home router even need know address router
It blindly send packet router home ISP assuming larger router know get typically called default
Here way think
Think train station get city A B
When look map train station city A tell train take get city B
However map tell get final destination city B
However city B probably find detailed map tell get final destination within city B need access map still city A

I fairly new C programming I encountered bit masking
Can someone explain general concept function bit masking
Examples much appreciated
A mask defines bit want keep bit want clear
Masking act applying mask value
This accomplished Below example extracting subset bit value Applying mask value mean want clear first higher bit keep last lower bit
Thus extracted lower bit
The result Masking implemented using AND C get Here fairly common Extracting individual byte larger word
We define bit word first byte
We use two operator shift right
This extract four byte integer Notice could switch order operator could first mask shift
The result would use different mask Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Subnet mask used determine belongs
An IP address two component network address address
For example consider IP address
Assuming part Class B network first two number represent Class B network address second two number identify particular host network
Subnetting enables network administrator divide host part address two subnets
In case part host address reserved identify particular subnet
This easier see show IP address binary format
If network divided subnets however first bit host address reserved identifying subnet
The subnet mask network address plus bit reserved identifying subnetwork convention bit network address set though would also work bit set exactly network address
In case therefore subnet mask would
It called used identify subnet IP address belongs performing mask IP address
The result subnetwork address The subnet address therefore
An IP subnet mask calculator used automatically calculate subnets
The calculator allows input IP address choose Subnet Mask Network class variable calculate subnet network mask
Results calculation provide hexadecimal IP address wildcard mask subnet ID broadcast address subnet address range resulting subnet network

Flash user might want see creating better looking mask smooth edge
Masking familiar technique computer graphic computer science general
It basically refers method data
You set data mask applied data get new set data filtered version original data
For instance say secret number written paper want people able see digit
What done
Let see
Here number written nice orange paper Since want others able see digit erase everything except digit
Or cut paper leaving digit
But want mess paper want keep number intact example might want allow people see digit instead future
Well idea get paper put hole location digit
You put paper top paper
Here paper cutout
When put paper top digit essentially show digit
Congratulations made mask
The paper hole metaphor mask
Now example want last digit also visible cut another hole mask paper
Then reason want show digit sequentially could move around mask like making mask paper bit transparent see going behind mask Notice one thing I make mask larger cover number otherwise unwanted area might showing
Now important thing remember Let move Flash mask
Now move mask cover number digit visible
So far good although good emulation mask real Flash mask
To see Flash software mask way let see problem approach
Move mask add digit number change mask Here I added end number
Now move mask cover number digit visible
Can done
No without changing mask size
And problem approach change data representation ie image size likely need change mask
Let fix real Flash mask
Move cutout look like Right click Mask layer select Mask
What done make content Mask layer mask
The Mask layer applied content layer
You might surprised see result show opposite previous fake mask The thing remember Flash graphic editor software
So see digit disappear covered opaque area
Let edit mask conform new rule first need unlock Mask layer edited click lock symbol next layer unlock layer
Following rule fill hollow square different color matter color use
And take red area completely
Lock mask layer see result
Sure enough work
Now even add digit number mask still work
You resize stage animate mask move digit digit using motion Tween moving mask
Here thing know masking Now let see example mask useful
This result Flash user might want see creating better looking mask smooth edge

The subnet mask particular network
Which following IP address belongs network
Little bit confuse octet SM But got point bit hired octet subnetting
convert IP address mask unsigned integer AND address mask
If result subnet
By using principle Ans Means Can I think like applying principle
save time No
You ca use shortcut method
Your rule fine rule valid
For example possible common local network subnet mask
Suppose IP address local host
Your rule would suggest ca match belongs class A network whereas subnet mask look like mask class However rule lead wrong conclusion
In fact network subnet mask
It possible take large network class A network divide multiple smaller local area network separate subset address space large network

A subnet small network inside larger network
It logical grouping connected network device tend located close physical proximity local area
There plenty time large network might need smaller network inside
A simple example large company network subnets human resource accounting department
Network designer employ subnets way partition network logical segment greater ease administration
When subnets properly implemented performance improved
A single IP address large business network may accept message file outside computer must decide company hundred thousand computer office receive
Subnetting give network logical tier organization identify correct path within company
Subnetting process dividing network two subnets
An IP address number identify network ID host ID
A subnet address borrows bit host ID IP address
Subnetting largely invisible computer user also network administrator
Any office school large number computer enjoy
They include There many disadvantage subnetting
The process likely require additional router switch hub expense
Also need experienced network administrator manage network subnets
You may need set subnet computer network
Unless network administration process bit complex
It probably best hire tech professional set subnet
However want try hand check
There error
Please try
Thank signing

On PHP JSON mention word bitmask
Wikipedia defined mask
I understand either bitmask mask useful
Can one explain term using layman term jargon
In computing number internally represented binary
This mean use integer type variable actually internally represented summation zero one
As might know single bit represents one one
A concatenation eight bit represent Byte
number
I presume know number represented binary take look
In PHP number mostly Bytes long
This mean number actually us bit internal storage
But simplicity reason throughout answer I use bit number
Now imagine want create program hold state based multiple value one zero
One could store value different variable may booleans integer
use single integer variable use bit internal bit represent different true falses
An example
Here first bit reading right left true represents first variable
The false represents variable
The third true
And
This compact way storing data many usage
This bit masking come
It sound complex actually simple
Bit masking allows use operation work
You actually apply value case value state mask binary number indicates bit interest
By performing binary operation mask state one could achieve following If want set particular value true could using OR operator following bit mask Or one could select particular value state using AND operator I suggest take deeper look get familiar jargon
A good start may link
Goodluck
It number represented binary
For example let say I boolean value I want store
I could store array booleans I could store single byte bit store one booleans
At point I easily manipulate byte I set specific bit true false check whether specific bit
All operation use operator move bit position

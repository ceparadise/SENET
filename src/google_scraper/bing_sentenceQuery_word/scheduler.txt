In field transaction management system abstract model describe execution transaction running system
Often operation action ordered time performed set executed together system
If order time certain operation determined system used
Examples operation requesting read operation reading writing aborting committing requesting lock locking etc
Not transaction operation type included schedule typically selected operation type data access operation included needed reason describe certain phenomenon
Schedules schedule property fundamental concept database theory
The following example schedule In example horizontal axis represents different transaction schedule The vertical axis represents time order operation
Schedule D consists three transaction
The schedule describes action transaction seen
First Reads Writes object X Commits
Then Reads Writes object Y Commits finally Reads Writes object Z Commits
This example schedule sequential overlap time action three transaction sequential transaction interleaved time
Representing schedule D table rather list convenience identifying transaction operation glance
This notation used throughout article
A common way technical literature representing schedule list Usually purpose reasoning concurrency control database operation modeled occurring point time without duration
When satisfactory start end possibly point event specified rarely
Real executed operation always duration specified respective time occurrence event within exact time beginning completion concurrency control reasoning usually precedence time whole operation without looking quite complex detail operation matter operation another operation
Furthermore many case relationship two specific operation matter specified specified pair operation
In general operation transaction schedule interleave transaction executed concurrently time order operation transaction remain unchanged implied transaction program
Since always time order operation transaction matter need specified schedule general operation rather order pair determined list operation
Also general case transaction may consist several process properly represented partial order operation rather total order
Thus general schedule partial order operation containing partial order transaction
two operation represented operation existence pair mean always schedule general case ordered pair
Such set schedule represented DAG operation node cycle allowed since cycle mean first operation cycle another second operation cycle contradicts perception
In many case graphical representation graph used demonstrate schedule
Since list operation table notation used article always represents total order operation schedule total order represented list always represented DAG
The transaction executed see example serial schedule one transaction start running transaction ended
A schedule equivalent outcome serial schedule property
In schedule E order action transaction executed D end E give result Two action said conflict conflicting pair The following set action conflicting While following set action The schedule said following two condition satisfied A schedule said schedule one serial schedule
Another definition schedule graph committed transaction considered acyclic graph defined include also uncommitted transaction cycle involving uncommitted transaction may occur without conflict serializability violation
Which serial schedule
A schedule said obeys CO also schedule property
This mean order time transaction commitment event compatible precedence partial order respective transaction induced schedule acyclic precedence graph serializability graph conflict graph
This implies also
The CO property especially effective achieving distributed system
discovered obviously mentioned
Its correct definition appears however description related technique theory partial inaccurate misleading
For extensive coverage commitment ordering source see
Two schedule said following condition satisfied A schedule said serial schedule
Note definition schedule
Notice example example discussion time
There however schedule schedule transaction performing The example since serial schedule
Since determining whether schedule little practical interest
Transactions commit transaction whose change read commit
These schedule recoverable
F recoverable commits make value read correct
Then commit
In aborted abort value A read incorrect
In case database left consistent state
If transaction abort transaction commits relied unrecoverable schedule
In example G unrecoverable read value A written committed
later aborted therefore value read wrong since committed schedule unrecoverable
Also named cascadeless
Avoids single transaction abort lead series transaction rollback
A strategy prevent cascading abort disallow transaction reading uncommitted change another transaction schedule
The following example one discussion recoverable In example although recoverable avoid cascading abort
It seen abort aborted order maintain correctness schedule already read uncommitted value written
The following recoverable schedule avoids cascading abort
Note however update A always lost since aborted
Note Schedule would serializable would committed
Cascading abort avoidance sufficient necessary schedule recoverable
A schedule strict strictness property two transaction write operation precedes operation either read write commit abort event also precedes conflicting operation
Any strict schedule cascadeless converse
Strictness allows efficient recovery database failure
The following expression illustrate hierarachical containment relationship class The illustrates clause graphically
In practice general purpose database system employ recoverable primarily strict schedule

In method work specified mean assigned resource complete work
The work may virtual computation element data turn scheduled onto hardware resource
A scheduler carry scheduling activity
Schedulers often implemented keep computer resource busy allow multiple user share system resource effectively achieve target
Scheduling fundamental computation intrinsic part computer system concept scheduling make possible single CPU
A scheduler may aim one many goal example maximizing total amount work completed per time unit minimizing time work becoming enabled first point begin execution resource minimizing time work becoming enabled finished case batch activity system responds hand first output user case interactive activity maximizing equal CPU time process generally appropriate time according priority workload process
In practice goal often conflict
throughput versus latency thus scheduler implement suitable compromise
Preference measured one concern mentioned depending upon user need objective
In environment industry example scheduler also must ensure process meet crucial keeping system stable
Scheduled task also distributed remote device across network administrative back end
The scheduler operating system module selects next job admitted system next process run
Operating system may feature three distinct scheduler type also known admission scheduler scheduler
The name suggest relative frequency function performed
The process scheduler part operating system decides process run certain point time
It usually ability pause running process move back running queue start new process scheduler known otherwise
The decides job process admitted ready queue main memory attempt made execute program admission set currently executing process either authorized delayed scheduler
Thus scheduler dictate process run system degree concurrency supported one time whether many process executed concurrently split process handled
The scheduler responsible controlling degree multiprogramming
In general process described either
An process one spends time spends computation
A process contrast generates request infrequently using time computation
It important scheduler selects good process mix process
If process ready queue almost always empty scheduler little
On hand process waiting queue almost always empty device go unused system unbalanced
The system best performance thus combination process
In modern operating system used make sure process get enough CPU time finish task
scheduling also important system system
For example interacting process often required prevent blocking due waiting
In case software typically used assist function addition underlying admission scheduling support operating system
The temporarily remove process main memory place secondary memory vice versa commonly referred swapping swapping also incorrectly paging
The scheduler may decide swap process active time process low priority process frequently process taking large amount memory order free main memory process swapping process back later memory available process unblocked longer waiting resource
Stallings Stallings In many system today support mapping virtual address space secondary storage swap file scheduler may actually perform role scheduler treating binary swapped process upon execution
In way segment binary required swapped demand lazy loaded
Stallings The also known decides ready process executed allocated CPU clock interrupt operating another form
Thus scheduler make scheduling decision much frequently scheduler scheduling decision minimum made every time slice short
This scheduler implying capable forcibly removing process CPU decides allocate CPU another process also known voluntary case scheduler unable force process CPU
A preemptive scheduler relies upon invokes run implement scheduling function
Another component involved function dispatcher module give control CPU process selected scheduler
It receives control kernel mode result interrupt system call
The function dispatcher involve following The dispatcher fast possible since invoked every process switch
During context switch processor virtually idle fraction time thus unnecessary context switch avoided
The time take dispatcher stop one process start another known
Scheduling discipline algorithm used distributing resource among party simultaneously asynchronously request
Scheduling discipline used handle packet traffic well share among disk drive printer embedded system etc
The main purpose scheduling algorithm minimize ensure fairness amongst party utilizing resource
Scheduling deal problem deciding outstanding request allocated resource
There many different scheduling algorithm
In section introduce several
In notion used alternative queuing data packet
The simplest scheduling algorithm scheduling algorithm scheduling
If differentiated guaranteed offered opposed communication may utilized
In advanced packet radio wireless network Downlink Packet Access cellular system may used take advantage
If channel condition favourable may increased
In even advanced system scheduling combined assigning component user best utilize
also known FCFS simplest scheduling algorithm
FIFO simply queue process order arrive ready queue
This commonly used example illustrated section
Earliest deadline first EDF dynamic scheduling algorithm used operating system place process priority queue
Whenever scheduling event occurs task finish new task released etc
queue searched process closest deadline next scheduled execution
Similar SJF
With strategy scheduler arranges process least estimated processing time remaining next queue
This requires advanced knowledge estimation time required process complete
The operating system assigns fixed priority rank every process scheduler arranges process ready queue order priority
process get interrupted incoming process
The scheduler assigns fixed time unit per process cycle
If process completes within get terminated otherwise rescheduled giving chance process
This used situation process easily divided different group
For example common division made foreground interactive process background batch process
These two type process different requirement may different scheduling need
It useful shared memory problem
A scheduler always try keep scheduled resource busy submitted job ready scheduled
In contrast conserving scheduler scheduler case may leave scheduled resource idle despite presence job ready scheduled
There several scheduling problem goal decide job go station time total minimized A common method embedded system schedule job manually
This example done fashion
Sometimes kernel divided three part Manual scheduling preemptive interrupt level
Exact method scheduling job often proprietary
When designing operating system programmer must consider scheduling algorithm perform best use system going see
There universal best scheduling algorithm many operating system use extended combination scheduling algorithm
For example us combination preemptive scheduling first first algorithm
In system thread dynamically increase decrease priority depending serviced already waiting extensively
Every priority level represented queue among thread among one
In sense response time short thread short critical system thread get completed quickly
Since thread use one time unit queue starvation problem longer thread
The algorithm used may simple process given equal time instance m usually m m cycling list
So process A executes m process B process C back process A
More advanced algorithm take account process priority importance process
This allows process use time process
The kernel always us whatever resource need ensure proper functioning system said infinite priority
In symmetric multiprocessing system considered increase overall system performance even may cause process run slowly
This generally improves performance reducing
IBM available three different scheduler
The difference variant often considered three different operating system Later virtual storage version MVS added feature scheduler schedule processor resource according elaborate scheme defined installation
Very early Microsoft Windows system feature scheduler
used scheduler meaning interrupt program
It relied program end tell OS need processor could move another process
This usually called cooperative multitasking
Windows introduced rudimentary preemptive scheduler however legacy support opted let bit application run without preemption
operating system use multilevel feedback queue
priority level defined priority normal priority priority soft priority requiring privilege assign
reserved Operating System
Users select priority assign running application Task Manager application thread management APIs
The kernel may change priority level thread depending CPU usage whether interactive
accepts responds input human raising priority interactive bounded process lowering CPU bound process increase responsiveness interactive application
The scheduler modified use modern processor keep track exactly many CPU cycle thread executed rather using interrupt routine
Vista also us priority scheduler queue disk defragmenters program interfere foreground operation
Mac OS us cooperative scheduling thread one process control multiple cooperative thread also provides preemptive scheduling multiprocessing task
The kernel schedule multiprocessing task using preemptive scheduling algorithm
All Process Manager process run within special multiprocessing task called blue task
Those process scheduled cooperatively using algorithm process yield control processor another process explicitly calling
Each process copy schedule process thread cooperatively thread yield control processor another thread calling
macOS us multilevel feedback queue four priority band thread normal system high priority kernel mode
Threads scheduled preemptively macOS also support cooperatively scheduled thread implementation Thread Manager
In AIX Version three possible value thread scheduling policy Threads primarily interest application currently consist several asynchronous process
These application might impose lighter load system converted multithreaded structure
AIX implement following scheduling policy FIFO round robin fair round robin
The FIFO policy three different implementation FIFO
The round robin policy named AIX fair round robin called
In priority level ranging used reserved task considered task level
For task time quantum switching process approximately m nice task approximately m
The scheduler ran ready process letting highest priority process go first run time slice placed expired queue
When active queue empty expired queue become active queue vice versa
However enterprise replaced scheduler backport maintained Linux Kernel series Linux kernel used distribution
In version kernel used developed many kernel developer Linux development
For many kernel time frame developed patch set improved interactivity scheduler even replaced scheduler
Con Kolivas work significantly implementation named Rotating Staircase Deadline inspired Ingo Molnár develop replacement earlier crediting Kolivas announcement
CFS first implementation fair queuing widely used operating system
The CFS us classic scheduling algorithm called originally invented
Fair queuing previously applied CPU scheduling name
The fair queuing CFS scheduler scheduling complexity O N N number task
Choosing task done constant time reinserting task run requires O log N operation implemented
The BFS also created Con Kolivas alternative CFS
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
reserved interrupt top half kernel user thread user thread idle user thread
Also like Linux us active queue setup also idle queue
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
reserved thread default policy user thread entered kernel thread user thread policy
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
Priorities reserved thread system thread thread low priority interrupt
Unlike Linux process done using time quantum given new priority put back queue
Solaris introduced two new scheduling class namely fixed priority class fair share class
The thread fixed priority priority range class priority dynamically adjusted
The fair scheduling class us CPU prioritize thread scheduling decision
CPU share indicate entitlement CPU resource
They allocated set process collectively known project

You start googling scheduling algorithm check Timeslicing inherent scheduling system practice AFAIK
I disagree InSciTek Jeff implication following scheduling That task priority rotation allowed run reach resource blocking condition yeilding next task rotation
I see could considered
This actually preemptive scheduling
However possible scheduling algorithm element preemptive scheduling VxWorks scheduling preemption enabled disabled default
The way enable scheduling provide value
I agree statement Therefore timeslicing based scheduling implies scheduling scheduling require equal time based timeslicing
You right require equal time
Preemption muck
And actually VxWorks task preempted scheduling task get control execute rest time allocated
Edit directed InSciTek Jeff I comment privilege Yes I referring task disabling although I obviously express well
You preempted ha
second comment
I hope debate salient point believe scheduling exist without time slicing
Or mean equal time based time slicing
I disagree former agree latter
I eager learn
Thanks
directed Jeff exist without timeslicing
That exactly happens VxWorks kernelTimeSlice disabled zero
I disagree statement
See section heading Scheduling
scheduling us time slicing achieve fair allocation CPU task priority
Each task group task priority executes defined interval time slice
scheduling enabled calling kernelTimeSlice take parameter time slice interval
If scheduling enabled preemption enabled executing task system tick handler increment task count
Timeslicing inherent scheduling
Otherwise relying task give CPU control scheduling intended solve
The answer even Wikipedia article describe scheduling inherently include periodic timeslicing
While common I believe scheduling timeslicing exactly thing
Certainly timeslicing make sense schedling implied rotating task however scheduling without timeslicing
That task priority rotation allowed run reach resource block condition next task rotation run
In word equal priority task exist reschedling point time
The idea actually realized specifically case Wind River VxWorks kernel
Within priority scheme task priority run round robin timeslice without specifically enabling feature kernel
The reason flexibility avoid overhead timeslicing task already known run block within well bounded time
Therefore timeslicing based scheduling implies scheduling scheduling require equal time based timeslicing
An opinion
It seems intertwining two mechanism one
Assuming OP original assertion In multitasking operating system context A round robin scheduler always schedule next item circular queue
How scheduler regains control perform scheduling separate unrelated
I disagree prevalent method yield waiting resource noted others
If I mistaken first Mac utilize used voluntary yield yield waiting resource year old brain cell wrong sometimes
Round robin simple scheduling algorithm time divided evenly among job without priority
For example process running process allowed run unit time another process allowed run
Round robin typically easy implement OS
Actaully getting confused Preemptive scheduling Round robin

Paul Krzyzanowski February If look process notice spends time executing instruction computing make request example read write data file get input user
After executes instruction wait
The period computation request called
Interactive process spend time waiting generally experience short CPU burst
A text editor example interactive process short CPU burst
process conversely spend time running instruction le time
They exhibit long CPU burst
A video transcoder example process long CPU burst
Even though read writes data spends time processing data
Most interactive process fact spend vast bulk existence nothing waiting data
As I write Mac I process running user account
This includes browser window word processor spreadsheet several shell window Photoshop iTunes various monitor utility
Most time process collectively using le CPU
This surprising since program waiting user input network message sleeping waking periodically check state
Consider GHz processor
It executes approximately million instruction per second even count hyperthreaded processor
It run billion instruction ten second might take skim web page click link billion instruction half second might take hit next key typing
The big idea increasing overall system throughput realization could keep several program memory switch processor run another process process wait operation
This
The next big idea realizing could process let another process run quickly enough give illusion many process running time
This
Most system large number process short CPU burst interspersed request small number process long CPU burst
To provide good performance may preempt running process let another one run
The also known operating system keep list process ready run blocked another blocking system request semaphore
The entry list pointer process control block store information state process
When request process complete process move state state get placed run queue
The component operating system responsible deciding whether currently running process continue running process run next
There four event may occur scheduler need step make decision The current process go state issue request operating system request satisfied immediately
The current process terminates
A timer interrupt cause scheduler run decide process run allotted interval time time move state
An operation complete process requested process move state
The scheduler may decide preempt process move process state
A scheduler scheduler ability get invoked interrupt move process state let another process run
The last two event list may cause happen
If scheduler take CPU away process scheduler
Old operating system Microsoft Windows Apple MacOS prior OS X example cooperative scheduler
Older batch processing system scheduler process ran termination process would allowed run
The decision scheduler make concerning sequence length time process may run called
These decision easy one scheduler limited amount information process ready run
A good scheduling algorithm It clear goal contradictory
For example minimizing overhead mean job run longer thus hurting interactive performance
Enforcing priority mean process always favored one causing indefinite postponement
These factor make scheduling task perfect algorithm
To make matter even complex scheduler know much behavior process certainly idea process future
As saw earlier process perform lot operation use little CPU time example web browser shell editor
They spend much time blocked state little burst computation
The overall performance constrained speed device
spend time computing example program circuit simulator
Their execution time largely determined speed CPU amount CPU time get
To help scheduler monitor process amount CPU time use programmable interval timer interrupt processor periodically typically time per second
This timer programmed operating system initializes
At interrupt operating system scheduler get run decide whether currently running process allowed continue running whether suspended another ready process allowed run
This mechanism enables preemptive
Preemptive scheduling allows scheduler control response time taking CPU away process decided running long order let another process run
It incurs overhead nonpreemptive scheduling since deal overhead context switching process instead allowing process run completion run next operation system call
However allows higher degree concurrency better interactive performance
The scheduling algorithm task figuring whether process switched another process process get run next
The component scheduler handle mechanism actually getting process run processor
This requires loading saved context selected process stored process control block comprises set register stack pointer flag status word pointer memory mapping typically pointer page table
Once context loaded dispatcher switch user mode via operation cause process execute location saved stack time program stopped running either via interrupt system call
In following section explore scheduling algorithm
Let first introduce term
Also known start time time task scheduled run actually get start running CPU
If look process series CPU burst start time applies CPU burst
It time CPU burst start run
Possibly straightforward approach scheduling process maintain FIFO run queue
New process go end queue
When scheduler need run process pick process head queue
This scheduler
If process block enters state scheduler pick process head queue
When complete waiting blocked process ready run get put end queue
With scheduling process long CPU burst hold process increasing turnaround time
Moreover hurt overall throughput since process state may complete CPU bound process still running
Now device used effectively
To increase throughput would great scheduler instead could briefly run bound process could run briefly request wait complete
Because CPU bound process get preempted hurt interactive performance interactive process get scheduled CPU bound one completed
FIFO scheduling simple implement
It also intuitively fair first one line get run first
The greatest drawback scheduling preemptive
Because suitable interactive job
Another drawback process delay job behind
Round robin scheduling preemptive version scheduling
Processes dispatched sequence process allowed run limited amount time
This time interval known
If process complete get blocked operation within time slice time slice expires process preempted
This preempted process placed back run queue must wait process already queue cycle CPU
If process get blocked due operation time slice expires course enters blocked operation
Once operation completes placed end run queue wait turn
A big advantage round robin scheduling scheduler dramatically improves average response time
By limiting task certain amount time operating system ensure cycle ready task giving one chance run
With round robin scheduling interactive performance depends length quantum number process run queue
A long quantum make algorithm behave much like first come first served scheduling since likely process block complete time slice
A small quantum let system cycle process quickly
This wonderful interactive process
Unfortunately overhead context switching frequently increase percentage system time used context switching rather real work
Advantage Round robin scheduling fair every process get equal share CPU
It easy implement know number process run queue know response time process
Disadvantage Giving every process equal share CPU always good idea
For instance highly interactive process get scheduled frequently process
A short quantum good allows many process circulate processor quickly getting brief chance run
This way highly interactive job usually use quantum wait long get CPU hence improving interactive performance
On hand short quantum bad operating system must perform context switch whenever process get preempted
This overhead anything CPU executing user code essentially overhead
A short quantum implies many context switch per unit time taking CPU away performing useful work work behalf process
The overhead associated context switch expressed length context switch time
An increase increase efficiency reduces average response time
As example suppose ten process ready run m m
Process head run queue list process state get run immediately
Process run Process quantum expires m context switch take place m start run m
Likewise process run another We compute amount time process delayed compare delay small quantum m long quantum We see quantum m ten process process end queue wait almost second get chance run
This much slow interactive task
When quantum reduced m last process wait le second get CPU
The downside quantum small context switch overhead
This mean wasting third CPU switching process
With quantum m context switch overhead
The scheduling algorithm preemptive version older algorithm known scheduling
Shortest job first scheduling run process completion running next one
The queue job sorted estimated job length short program get run first held long one
This minimizes average response time
Here extreme example
It three user submit job deck punched card operator
Two job estimated run minute third job third user estimate take hour run program
With shortest job first approach operator run job first let computer spend time job
With shortest remaining time first algorithm take account fact process run series CPU burst process may leave state need wait quantum expired
The algorithm sort run queue process anticipated CPU burst time picking shortest burst time
Doing optimize average response time process
Let consider example five process run queue
If process FIFO manner see CPU burst add pick favorite time unit example
The mean run time process however mean run time run time
In example mean run time
If reorder process queue estimated CPU burst time still overall total process take amount time run mean run time change
It
We reduced average run time process
The biggest problem sorting process way trying optimize schedule using data even
We know CPU burst time process next run
It might immediately request might continue running minute expiration time slice
The best guess try predict next CPU burst time assuming related past CPU burst process
All interactive process follow following sequence operation compute compute compute Suppose CPU burst compute period measured T
The next compute period measured T
The common approach estimate length next CPU burst using previous CPU burst process
We examine one function although variation theme
Let measured time burst predicted size CPU burst weighing factor
Define default system average burst time
The estimate next CPU burst period The weighing factor adjusted much weigh past history versus considering last observation
If last observation CPU burst period count
If last observation much weight historical weight
As get smaller historical weight count recent weight
Here example
The blue bar represent actual CPU burst time
The red bar represent estimated value
With weighting value see red bar strongly influenced previous actual value factor older value
Now let see happens set
This ignores history look previous CPU burst
We see red bar current estimate exactly value previous blue bar latest actual CPU burst
For final example let set
Here last measured value count estimated CPU burst dictated history
We see immediate change CPU burst le impact estimate compared graph
Note estimate still remain relatively high despite rapid plunge actual CPU burst value
This scheduling optimal always produce lowest mean response time
Processes short CPU burst given priority hence run quickly scheduled frequently
process hurt long mean waiting time
In fact process always available run one may never get scheduled
The situation process never get scheduled run called
Another problem algorithm effectiveness meeting scheduling criterion relies ability estimate length next CPU burst
Round robin scheduling assumes process equally important
This generally case
We would sometimes like see long process get lower priority interactive process
These process turn get lower priority job critical operating system
In addition different user may different status
A system administrator process may rank student
These goal led introduction
The idea process assigned priority number
Of process ready run one highest priority get run next general agreement across operating system whether high number represents high low priority system tend use smaller number high priority Microsoft system tend use higher number high priority
With priority scheduler scheduler simply pick highest priority process run
If system us preemptive scheduling process preempted whenever higher priority process available run queue
Priorities may
determined system using factor time limit process memory requirement anticipated CPU ratio factor
assigned administrator
Priorities may also
A process keep priority entire life process
A process priority changed scheduler course execution
The scheduler would achieve scheduling goal
For example scheduler may decide decrease process priority give chance job run
If process bound spending time waiting scheduler may give higher priority get run queue quickly schedule another operation
Static dynamic priority coexist
A scheduler would know process static priority priority adjusted throughout course execution
Ignoring dynamic priority priority scheduling algorithm straightforward process priority number assigned scheduler simply pick process highest priority
priority scheduling provides good mechanism relative importance process may precisely defined
If high priority process use lot CPU time lower priority process may starve postponed indefinitely leading
Another problem priority scheduling deciding process get priority level assigned
One approach problem indefinite postponement use dynamic priority
At expiration quantum scheduler decrease priority current running process thereby penalizing taking much CPU time
Eventually priority fall next highest process process allowed run
Another approach scheduler keep track low priority process get chance run increase priority eventually priority high enough process get scheduled run
Once run quantum priority brought back previous low level
This periodic boosting process priority ensure get chance run called
A simple way implement aging simply increase process priority get readjusted execute
What happens several process get assigned priority
This realistic possibility since picking unique priority level possibly hundred thousand process system may feasible
We group process assign separate run queue class
This allows u categorize separate system process interactive process interactive process background process
The scheduler pick queue class least one process
In sense behaves like priority scheduler
Each queue may use different scheduling algorithm desired
scheduling per priority level common
As long process ready high priority queue scheduler let run time slice
Only process available run priority level scheduler look lower level
Alternatively high priority level might implement scheduling approach ensure critical task get processing need
The scheduler may also choose different quantum priority level
For example common give process longer quantum
They get run often since low priority queue scheduler let run longer
Linux hand opposite
It give longer quantum process assumption important likely interactive usually block long using time slice
One problem multilevel queue process need assigned suitable priority queue
If process assigned queue optimal either process overall throughput
queue generally used scheduling discipline separate broad class process kernel thread interactive background process
Specific scheduler within class determine process get run within class
Most operating system including Windows Linux OS X support form multilevel queue scheduling class
A variation multilevel queue allow scheduler adjust priority use process execution order move one queue another based recent behavior process
The goal automatically place process priority level based CPU burst behavior
process end higher priority queue process end low priority queue
A multilevel feedback queue us two basic rule A new process get placed highest priority queue
If process finish quantum block stay priority level round robin otherwise move next lower priority level With approach process long CPU burst use entire time slice get preempted get placed queue
A highly interactive process use quantum remain high priority level
Although strictly necessary algorithm successive queue may given longer quantum
This allows process remain queue corresponds longest CPU burst
One problem multilevel feedback queue
If lot interactive process new process frequently created always task available queue process queue never get scheduled
A related problem interactive process may end low priority level
If process ever period becomes trickle low priority level forever doomed remain
An example game need spend considerable CPU time initializing becomes interactive spending time waiting user input
Both problem solved
As saw earlier periodically increase priority process ensure scheduled run
A simple approach periodically bring process highest priority queue
An advantage multilevel feedback queue algorithm designed adjust priority process whenever run process quickly trickle back low priority level interactive process remain high level
If programmer know scheduler work want write software ensure process remains high priority level write code force system block operation sleep millisecond quantum expires
That way process rewarded using quantum even repeatedly us large chunk
A solution approach modify way scheduler decides demote priority process
Instead simply checking whether process us time slice keep track total time process spent running larger time interval several time slice
Each priority queue maximum CPU time allotment associated
If process us allotment interval process punished moved lower priority level
feedback queue good separating process category based need CPU
They favor bound process letting run often
Versions scheduling policy increase quantum lower priority level also favor CPU bound process giving larger chunk CPU time allowed run
The priority scheme one controlled system rather administrator user
A process deemed important necessarily important happens lot
This scheduler also drawback process become CPU bound process become get scheduled well
Moreover process danger starving system many interactive process
Both problem dealt applying process aging
Another drawback ability programmer keep priority process high performing bogus operation periodically
Again solution measuring CPU use larger time interval punishing process use CPU
With also known goal allow process granted proportional share CPU specific percentage
Conceptually lottery scheduling work allocating specific number ticket process
The ticket process higher chance scheduled
For example suppose ticket total three process run
We would like schedule process twice frequently process
To assign twice many ticket
With ticket numbered range might assign The scheduler pick random number range
That number becomes winning ticket process holding ticket get run
When time slice block sheduler pick another ticket process get run
Over time process run random distribution one weighted ticket allocation
The benefit algorithm process given proportional share CPU
The difficulty determining ticket distribution particularly environment process come go get blocked
This useful algorithm scheduling useful environment process may need allocated share CPUs running multiple virtual machine server
Our discussion thus far assumed environment single process get run time
Other ready process wait scheduler switch context give chance run
With multiple CPUs multiple core one CPU hyperthreaded processor thread execution scheduled time
The scheduling algorithm apply scheduler simply allows one process running state one time
The environment consider common symmetric multiprocessing SMP one processor access memory device
Each processor running process may time invoke system call terminate interrupted timer interrupt
The scheduler executes processor decides process context switched run
It common operating system maintain one run queue per processor
This allows one processor manipulate queue context switching without worry delay queue locked another processor
Processors designed cache memory hold region memory process accessed
This avoids time delay going external memory bus access memory provides huge boost performance
As see forthcoming discussion memory management processor also contain translation lookaside buffer TLB store recent virtual physical address translation
This also speed memory access dramatically
When scheduler reschedules process onto processor chance cached memory TLB line still present
This allows process run faster since make le reference main memory
If scheduler reschedules process onto different processor part process present processor cache program start slowly populates cache
aspect scheduling multiprocessor system scheduler keep track processor process ran previously attempt reschedule process onto processor
There two form processor affinity
ensures process always get scheduled onto processor
approach
A scheduler attempt schedule process onto CPU case may move process onto different processor
The reason even though may initial performance penalty start process another CPU probably better CPU sit idle process run
The scheduler try CPUs make sure sufficient number task run queue
There two approach load balancing among processor operating system check load number process run queue processor periodically
If imbalance process moved one processor onto another
scheduler find process run queue processor
In case raid another processor run queue transfer process onto queue something run
It common combine push pull migration Linux example
The real world simple deciding whether run task processor
Many system multiple processor preferable others rescheduling ready task
The category process include What realization task migrated another processor migrating processor preferable others
For example scheduling task different core chip preferable scheduling onto core different chip
Linux introduces concept handle
Scheduling domain allow system organize processor hierarchy processor grouped desirable migration group lowest layer hyperthreaded CPUs core least desirable migration group highest layer hierarchy migrating across processor different circuit board NUMA system
A scheduling domain constains one CPU group
Each CPU group treated one entity domain
A domain treat domain group
For example two hyperthreaded CPUs sharing core placed one group two subgroup one CPU
All group make domain represents entire processor
Each CPU runqueue structure associated
In addition structure needed keep track ready process balanced tree set queue structure keep track scheduling data including statistic CPU load
Each scheduling domain balancing policy associated defines balancing rule specific level hierarchy
This policy answer question How often attempt made balance load across group domain
How far load domain get unbalanced balancing across group needed
How long group domain sit idle
Linux performs active load balancing periodically
The scheduler move scheduling domain hierarchy check group along way
If group deemed balance based policy rule task moved one CPU run queue another rebalance domain
Linux support modular scheduling system accommodate different scheduler
A defines common set function define behavior scheduler add task remove task choose next task tor run
Multiple scheduler run concurrently
Each task system belongs one scheduling class
A task belong one two scheduling class implement CFS completely fair share scheduler general purpose multilevel queue scheduler dynamically adjusts priority level based much virtual runtime task used period time
Tasks spend time running using CPU given lower priority spend spend le time running
implement simple multilevel scheduler task
To pick task run scheduler iterates list scheduling class find class highest priority runnable task

For following job The would using FCFS algorithm What would
You need determine time job completed
With scheduler simple calculate job start soon processor becomes free take exactly burst time complete
You already calculated start end time calculate wait time use obtain turnaround time
For example A arrives time
The processor free start time end time
Then processor run B wait unit finish time turnaround time
The answer book seems totaling completion time without regard arrival time
This something I recognize
turnaround time Completion time give average As already said Tournaround time TAT time submission completion
If look task A arrives time submission time take timeunits finish
mean TAT A let look task B arrives time wait A finish
A finish B start working finish
Now subtract arrival time minus finishing time TAT
Now C arrival time working time burst finishing Tat Now D arrival time working time burst finishing Tat Now E arrival time working time burst finishing Tat result tada
EXECUTION AROUND TIME AND THEN THE EXECUTION ADDS TO THE NEXT EXECUTION TO THE ALREADY EXISTING TIME TO SUBTRACT THE ARRIVAL TIME
THEN ADD ALL THE TURNAROUND TIME AND THE DIVIDE THERE SUM TOTAL BY THERE TOTAL NUMBER By posting answer agree

If process ready state CPU OS must choose one run next
The part OS make choice scheduler
It us scheduling algorithm choose
If OS support kernel level thread thread process scheduled
Here going talk process scheduling mostly
As CPUs got powerful scheduling become le importance
However scheduling algorithm got complex
First let talk scheduling needed When CPU becomes free like process terminates
It also needed new process becomes ready
Process execution usually burst execution IO waiting
If CPU burst really long process might wait wait wait yougetthepoint
This need dealt
Example time
We got process call A B
A CPU burst time arbitrary time unit
B CPU burst time
Let try letting A go first Note mean process ready mean running
Now B go first Now work average turnaround time
When A went first average turnaround time When B went first When A first When B first So lower B went first
This simplest scheduling algorithm
The first process enter ready state get CPU first blocked finished hold CPU
FCFS requires single queue ready process
So process becomes ready go back queue
When CPU becomes free execute process front queue
You remember need stop process long CPU burst hogging CPU long
With scheduling process get keep CPU end switch blocked state
With preemptive scheduling process maximum time run
If end time still running get interrupted scheduler chooses another process run
These fixed amount time called either
They normally last millisecond
Let example earlier preemptive scheduling added
The time slice
First A B Now B A This actually diagram B A without preemptive scheduling
Therefore average turnaround time still average wait time still
A B A B Basically lot process ready state CPU given process turn
This called
This simplest algorithm time sharing It pretty much FCFS time slice added
It important fair
We also need consider following criterion Every time process switched CPU time taken switching aka context switching
If use small time slice cost context switch higher
For example use time slice context switch CPU time context switching real work
However make time slice big seem though using FCFS
In example shorter process first gave better result
When process become available simultaneously better shortest job first
This preemptive version SJF
Every time new process ready state arrives look CPU burst time
If le time needed complete current process move current process ready state schedule new one instead
The problem process long CPU time always wait newer shorter process keep arriving
Also impossible predict long process take know keep getting moved CPU
Using round robin assumes process equal importance
But might higher others
What gave higher time slice higher priority process ran first
There lot option priority scheduling important avoid starvation low priority process left waiting CPU forever Static priority priority externally defined
Dynamic one internally defined system order achieve certain goal
For example system may boost priority IO bound process
Both type may used
What instead queue process ready state multiple queue one different priority
It could done way There lot algorithm
system may need use different type algorithm example earliest deadline first Stuff I may glossed available I super cool I computer science unrelated coolness Fill detail click icon log You commenting using account

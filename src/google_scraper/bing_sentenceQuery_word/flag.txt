Flag Definition A variable quantity take one two value
It used indicate one two outcome used control two thing done
Search Flag UK US Search Flag rest Computing Students

A data structure used
It consists number adjacent computer memory location allocated hold sequence stored single bit group bit within set addressed
A bit field commonly used represent known fixed
The meaning individual bit within field determined programmer example first bit bit field located field sometimes used determine state particular attribute associated bit field
Within logic device collection bit field called flag commonly used control indicate intermediate state outcome particular operation
Microprocessors typically composed flag used indicate various condition example
The flag read used decide subsequent operation processing conditional
For example Jump Equal instruction result jump Z zero flag set previous operation
A bit field distinguished latter used store large set bit indexed integer often wider integral type supported language
Bit field hand typically fit within machine denotation bit independent numerical index
Bit field used reduce memory consumption program requires number integer variable always low value
For example many system storing integer value requires two byte memory sometimes value stored actually need one two bit
Having number tiny variable share bit field allows efficient packaging data memory
In C native bit field created using unsigned int signed int
In case programmer declare structure bit field label determines width several subfields
Adjacently declared bit field type packed compiler reduced number word compared memory used declared separately
For language lacking native bitfields programmer want strict control resulting bit representation possible manually manipulate bit within larger word type
In case programmer set test change bit field using combination
Declaring bit field The layout bit field C
For behavior remains predictable across compiler may preferable emulate bit field primitive bit operator A simple example bitfield included design processor
One field held seven piece information Another example code used flag word pas status information another process
For example program monitor status eight burglar alarm switch could set bit exit code passing along another process information switch closed open
A subset flag flag field may extracted
In addition large number language due operator use performing evaluates exponentiation also support use operator combination operator determine value one bit
Suppose decimal returned within want check flag bit
The flag interest literal one
binary binary evaluates original mean flag bit set alternatively set operation would evaluated
Thus check th bit variable perform operation Writing reading toggling bit flag done using OR AND NOT operation operation performed quickly processor
To set bit status byte mask byte
Any bit set mask byte status byte set result
To toggle bit status byte mask byte
This set bit cleared clear bit set

n A mark signal particular condition status
A flag like either
The flag said turned
A special mark indicating piece unusual
For example might contain indicate record consists unusual probably incorrect data
v To mark indicate particular occurred object marked unusual way

Some CPUs flag register ARM others MIPS
What advantage CMP instruction update flag register followed branch instruction instead using zero register conditional branch check sign overflow etc
In modern register renaming implementation cost flag flag pretty similar
The main difference I think flag indicate characteristic value Is value negative
Is value zero
Does value even odd parity
represent event occurred previous operation add instruction carry overflow
This led addition architecture
On architecture carry flag special instruction includes carry flag previous add instruction
This make simulating arithmetic relatively inexpensive many architecture flag register
On flip side testing register zero actually surprisingly expensive
To test register zero need perform NOR operation requires O N level logic calculate
On architecture flag register extra logic calculation end ALU stage cause clock run slower force ALU two cycle operation
For reason I think architecture like SPARC two version arithmetic operation one set flag one
But MIPS save anything
They moved problem somewhere else
On MIPS instruction
This mean branch instruction must actually ALU stage including something like bitwise operation followed reduce single bit determining way branch go
The DEC Alpha architecture tried split difference using trick
DEC Alpha flag register also instruction
Instead branch instruction look state single general purpose register
There etc
The trick give every general purpose register extra bit tell whether bit zero
This make like flag register branch instruction look single bit already calculated make decision back figuring calculate extra zero indicator bit normal ALU cycle
And still ca arithmetic looking carry flag previous operation
Having test instruction set flag way reduce register pressure register starved architecture
If enough register modify one ignore result
The trick register input value encoding trick convenient enough register fixing one better increasing number instruction
It convenient use target well reduces number false dependency
Encoding
If encode condition jump jump operand two compared jump target two like immediate value one like big possible jump often encoding format target use many bit possible
Or drop possibility
Using flag give opportunity set
It comparison operation set flag whatever want
With caveat operation set flag careful ensure last operation set flag one want
If flag able test number condition often multiplied number instruction able set flag If using flag end many conditional jump thing test thing allow test easily carry overflow instance
Testing flag easy done quickly
The complex test effect cycle time pipeline structure pipelined
That especially true simpler implementation get high end processor using trick book effect pretty minimal
Having flag mean lot instruction multiple result natural result modified flag
And POV multiple result bad keep track association
When one set flag introduce dependency unneeded flag used handle way another
Again especially true simpler implementation get high end processor using trick book additional difficulty dwarfed rest processor
On machine instruction used part addition sequence need accept bit worth operand compute bit sum
The specification identify operand bit come specification say lower bit result go add one extra operand upper bit result
Being allowed specify part instruction extra operand come extra result bit go would moderately useful would generally useful justify extra field opcode
Having fixed location handle carry flag little bit awkward perspective lot cheaper additional operand field much practical way trying handle arithmetic
If one trying design instruction set allow arithmetic instruction limited two operand one destination operand one could implement add four instruction set would carry zero otherwise compute compute compute going beyond would require three instruction additional word
Having carry flag available supplemental source destination reduces cost one instruction per word
Note btw instruction bit control whether instruction update flag register may facilitate execution since instruction use modify flag bit must maintain sequence relative instruction neither may freely rearranged
Given sequence execution unit could fairly easily recognize third instruction could execute without wait data read second instruction would possible execution unit could ensure time anything tried use flag zero flag would hold value established third instruction carry flag would hold value second
Simple answer quick cheap memory operation requires absolutely internal bus usage except instruction
It used stack bool stack process bit memory

I see variable named source code work code
What mean
What dirty flag
Generally used indicate data changed need eventually written external destination
It written immediate adjacent data may also get changed writing bulk data generally efficient writing individual value
There deeper issue rather What mean
context code I think really asking appropriate term generally intended
potentially confusing misleading
It suggest many new programmer corrupt erroneous form data
The work implies something wrong data need purged removed
Something dirty undesirable unclean unpleasant
If mean form touched form amended change yet written server rather
That I think question programming community need address
Dirty could mean number thing need provide context
But general sense dirty flag used indicate whether something touched modified
For instance see usage dirty bit context memory management Dirty often used context caching caching architectural caching
In general two kind caching mechanism write write back
We use WT WB short
mean write done cache backing store
By saying cache backing store example stand main memory disk respectively context database
In contrast initially writing done cache
The write backing store postponed cache block containing new content
dirty value
When implementing WB cache set dirty bit indicate whether cache block contains dirty value

rate reliably transmitted
Following term channel capacity given highest information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
The notion channel capacity central development modern wireline wireless communication system advent novel mechanism resulted achieving performance close limit promised channel capacity
Let random variable representing input output channel respectively
Let function given inherent fixed property communication channel
Then choice completely determines due identity turn induces
The defined taken possible choice
If used define communication channel symbol graph vertex two codewords may confused symbol position equal adjacent
The computational complexity finding Shannon capacity channel remains open upper bounded another important graph invariant
The state ε transmission le channel capacity encoding decoding scheme transmitting data rate whose error probability le ε sufficiently large block length
Also rate greater channel capacity probability error receiver go one block length go infinity
An application channel capacity concept AWGN channel Hz measured taken base per second used assuming signal noise power measured watt volt ratio expressed power ratio dB since figure often cited dB conversion may needed
For example dB power ratio
This section focus scenario
For channel capacity system multiple antenna see article
If average received power W noise AWGN channel capacity received ratio SNR
This result known
When SNR large SNR dB capacity logarithmic power approximately linear bandwidth
This called
When SNR small SNR dB capacity linear power insensitive bandwidth
This called
The regime regime illustrated figure
The capacity channel given power allocation gain subchannel chosen meet power constraint
In coherence time greater latency requirement definite capacity maximum rate reliable communication supported channel depends random channel gain unknown transmitter
If transmitter encodes data rate probability decoding error probability made arbitrarily small case system said outage
With probability channel deep fade capacity channel strict sense zero
However possible determine largest value outage probability le
This value known capacity
In latency requirement greater coherence time codeword length span many coherence period one average many independent channel fade coding large number coherence time interval
Thus possible achieve reliable rate communication meaningful speak value capacity channel

I preparing presentation work using documentation provided supplier claim made GPON network capacity
Instantly looked odd I know advanced version InfiniBand go
I could find evidence supported supplier claim turning throughput GPON
The colleague given documentation I working said supplier claimed speed independent device network limited Optical Network Units ONUs endpoint device
That seems bit ridiculous considering data optical cable pulse light
Light travel vacuum surely speed network close way speed electromagnetic wave propagation wire I never heard manufacturer claim cable support speed
I brought supplier rep derisively let know capacity throughput
I aware lot people term interchangeable technical standpoint throughput amount data sent network specified amount time capacity
It would seem like capacity optical fibre flash light likely hold
NB question science behind computer data network I belongs despite reference particular hardware
The easiest way think situation say thing network capacity
To ear term capacity make sense data rest storage medium throughput data motion network data motion
I sure people used phrase network capacity mean something specific appear salesperson using way I suggest accept particular example sale literature appears kinda meaningless move
Not mention clever use make claim almost unfalsifiable
Capacity similar many term overloaded word
In example bring seems meaning equivalent throughput maximal amount information
transfer per time unit
However term used interchangeably ear capacity feel theoretical limit throughput feel practical limit
As capacity fiber channel due coding error technical limitation lead maximal throughput YOUR data
A different explanation may used setting one capacity link measured relative term ratio multiplied predefined maximal rate information transfer
This notation useful computing flow network

I struggling find calculate channel capacity binary symmetric channel given alpha mean error p p r I found course C r
omega alpha So I However I stuck calculate omega binary entropy mean error
We never seen solve exercise course help would appreciated
Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
I fairly confused question terminology
In case BSC channel error probability p channel X x case p x case known capacity channel p H binary entropy function H x x
That BSC capacity
This per channel instantiation multiply r get seems want

Thank opportunity help question
Data rate bandwidth noise error rate four item related channel capacity influence
Data rate rate descript data communication bit per second bps
Bandwidth kind constrain transmitted signal
It always occur constrain transmitter nature medium
It expressed Hertz
Noise unwanted electromagnetic energy signal transmits transmitter receiver
Error rate mean error transmit reception opposite situation
We know thing equal doubling bandwidth double data rate
Thus bandwidth influence data rate
And higher data rate unwanted noise get
If data increased bit become noise affect bit
So given noise level higher data rate occur higher error rate
And description I think bandwidth important item influence three item

Learn text image sound converted binary processed computer image sound compressed create smaller file
Images also need converted order computer process seen screen
Digital image made
Each pixel image made binary number
If say black white simple black white picture created using binary
To create picture grid set square coloured black white
But grid created size grid need known
This data called computer need metadata know size image
If metadata image created mean picture pixel across pixel
This example show image created way The system described far fine black white image image need use colour well
Instead using using four possible number allow image use four colour
In binary represented using two per pixel While still large range colour adding another binary digit double number colour available The number bit used store pixel called
Images colour need pixel store available colour
This mean image use lot colour stored larger file
Image quality affected image
The resolution image way describing tightly packed pixel
In image pixel larger fewer needed fill space
This result image look blocky
An image high resolution pixel look lot better zoom stretch
The downside pixel file size bigger

Images either vector bitmap
Bitmap image made small part called pixel
Vector image made using coordinate geometry
Images compressed reduce file size
Image file usually also contain

Want watch later
If introduced HTML probably know HTML tag
A special word angle bracket make readable way organize thing web page document
Here example HTML tag So tag
They usually come opening closing pair like one shown example insert tag tag
A lot like regular HTML tag except word mean need closing tag unless using XHTML
The thing HTML tag define contain actual data site whereas meta tag defines something data call typically
Imagine Christmas want keep track present bought everybody want write package
You could maintain inventory tag package
Well kind meta tag like
It bit information web page meant organizing need without visible receiver
Like Metadata like text hidden web page user ca see though still
Why
Web page use meta tag search engine robot web crawler automatic thing scan web page gather critical information needed find organize
Here common example useful meta tag inserted within open closed marker head section Notice meta tag come open closed pair
The meta information simply contained within one open angle bracket beginning one closed angle bracket end
Refer green arrow image
As see meta tag always us left side equal sign listing name label right side listing associated value
In example meta tag paired term meta tag paired word
It easy way associate label something
This particular meta tag list keywords associated web page
Now search engine scan page find keywords lesson even people visiting page ca see word
So somebody search lesson good chance see page listed search result
Nifty huh
Would like see example meta tag
We looked one keywords also meta tag web page site last page version among others
All meta tag go header head section body body section
Here example three mentioned As see within head section meta name paired content author name case Sue
The meta information site description revision detail come right followed closing tag
We also tricky thing meta tag
We tell web page somewhere else handy As see head section used meta tag set three second
After three second user browser redirect URL specified
We even use meta tag keep track user visit web page save computer
That way user visit page pick right left Get FREE access day create account
When user visit page meta tag set cookie user name using simplicity expire certain future date
We mention super common tag technically meta tag
Meta tag optional whereas tag considered required according World Wide Web Consortium make sure kind standard
But bear mind standard guideline page follow although good idea try
The obvious example special tag tag located within head section
Here
Notice closing tag
That
You learned need know start using meta tag
Shall quickly review learned today
HTML us tag group information meta tag special kind tag list information page
This information want share want everybody see
Regular tag usually come open closed pair head meta tag unless using XHTML another lesson
Meta tag use associate label bit information
Some kind meta tag site site web page information
Some neat trick meta tag include site visitor adding
That pretty much
With meta tag like Christmas every day hidden tag every package

information provides information data
Three distinct type metadata exist
Metadata traditionally used library converted catalog data digital database
In digital format becoming prevalent way storing data information metadata also used describe digital data using
There different metadata standard different discipline collection etc
Describing data increase usefulness
For example may include metadata specifying software language page written HTML tool used create subject page find information subject
This metadata automatically improve reader experience make easier user find web page online
A may include metadata providing information musician singer songwriter whose work appears disc
A principal purpose metadata help user find relevant information discover resource
Metadata also help organize electronic resource provide digital identification support archiving preservation resource
Metadata assist user resource discovery allowing resource found relevant criterion identifying resource bringing similar resource together distinguishing dissimilar resource giving location information
Metadata telecommunication activity including traffic widely collected various national governmental organization
This data used purpose used mass
In many country metadata relating email telephone call web page video traffic IP connection cell phone location routinely stored government organization
For example may include metadata describes large picture color depth image resolution image created shutter speed data
A text document metadata may contain information long document author document written short summary document
Metadata within web page also contain description page content well key word linked content
These link often called Metatags used primary factor determining order web search late
The reliance metatags web search decreased late keyword stuffing
Metatags largely misused trick search engine thinking website relevance search really
Metadata stored managed often called
However without context point reference might impossible identify metadata looking
For example database containing several number digit long could result calculation list number plug equation without context number perceived data
But given context database log book collection number may identified information refers book information within book
The term metadata coined Philip Bagley book Extension Programming Language Concepts clear us term ISO traditional sense structural metadata
data container data rather alternate sense content individual instance data content metacontent type data usually found library catalogue
Since field information management information science information technology librarianship widely adopted term
In field word defined data data
While generally accepted definition various discipline adopted specific explanation us term
While metadata application manifold covering large variety field specialized model specify type metadata
Singley distinguish two distinct class metadata guide metadata
describes structure database object table column key index
help human find specific item usually expressed set keywords natural language
According metadata divided similar category technical metadata business metadata
corresponds internal metadata corresponds external metadata
Kimball add third category
On hand NISO distinguishes among three type metadata descriptive structural administrative
typically used discovery identification information search locate object title author subject keywords publisher
describes component object organized
An example structural metadata would page ordered form chapter book
Finally give information help manage source
Administrative metadata refers technical information including file type file created
Two administrative metadata right management metadata preservation metadata
explains intellectual property right contains information preserve save resource
An additional type metadata beginning developed
new concept library however advance universal design raised profile
Projects like GPII identified lack common terminology model describe need preference user information fit need major gap providing universal access solution

Those type information accessibility metadata
incorporated several accessibility property based IMS Global Access All Information Model Data Element Specification
The Wiki page list several property value
While effort describe standardize varied accessibility need information seeker beginning become robust adoption established metadata schema developed
For example Dublin Core DC audience MARC reading level could used identify resource suitable user dyslexia DC Format could used identify resource available braille audio large print format work done
Metadata metacontent correctly vocabulary used assemble metadata metacontent statement typically structured according standardized concept using metadata scheme including
Tools used apply standardization metadata
Structural metadata commonality also paramount importance development
Metadata metacontent syntax refers rule created structure field element metadata metacontent
A single metadata scheme may expressed number different markup programming language requires different syntax
For example Dublin Core may expressed plain text
A common example guide metacontent bibliographic classification subject
There always implied statement classification object
To classify object example Dewey class number Topology
book number spine implied statement book subject heading
This triple importantly triple
The first two element triple class attribute piece structural metadata defined semantic
The third element value preferably controlled vocabulary reference master data
The combination metadata master data element result statement metacontent statement
metacontent metadata master data
All element thought vocabulary
Both metadata master data vocabulary assembled metacontent statement
There many source vocabulary meta master data UML EDIFACT XSD SKOS Pantone Linnaean Binomial Nomenclature etc
Using controlled vocabulary component metacontent statement whether indexing finding endorsed If indexer searcher guided choose term concept relevant document retrieved
This particularly relevant considering search engine internet Google
The process index page match text string using complex algorithm intelligence inferencing occurring illusion thereof
Metadata schema hierarchical nature relationship exist metadata element element nested relationship exist element
An example hierarchical metadata schema schema metadata element may belong parent metadata element
Metadata schema also linear element completely discrete element classified according one dimension
An example linear metadata schema schema one dimensional
Metadata schema often two dimensional planar element completely discrete element classified according two orthogonal dimension
In case metadata schema exceed planar depiction type required enable display view metadata according chosen aspect serve special view
Hypermapping frequently applies layering geographical geological information overlay
The degree data metadata structured referred
Granularity refers much detail provided
Metadata high granularity allows deeper detailed structured information enables greater level International standard apply metadata
Much work accomplished national international standard community especially American National Standards Institute International Organization Standardization reach consensus standardizing metadata registry
The core metadata registry standard Metadata Registries MDR framework standard described
A new edition Part final stage publication early
It revised align current edition Part extends MDR support registration Concept Systems
see
This standard specifies schema recording meaning technical structure data unambiguous usage human computer
standard refers metadata information object data data data
In information object data Data Elements Value Domains reusable semantic representational information object describe meaning technical detail data item
This standard also prescribes detail metadata registry registering administering information object within Metadata Registry
Part also provision describing compound structure derivation data element example calculation collection one data element form derived data
While standard describes originally data element registry purpose support describing registering metadata content independently particular application lending description discovered reused human computer developing new application database analysis data collected accordance registered metadata content
This standard become general basis kind metadata registry reusing extending registration administration portion standard
The Geospatial community tradition specialized standard particularly building tradition catalogue
Formal metadata usually essential geospatial data common approach applicable
The metadata term set vocabulary term used describe resource purpose discovery
The original set classic metadata term known Dublin Core Metadata Element Set endorsed following standard document Although standard also mentioned section approach semantic markup seek existing tag convey metadata
Microformat follows XHTML HTML standard standard
One advocate microformats characterized problem alternative approach Metadata may written file identify owns copyright contact information brand model camera created file along exposure information shutter speed etc
descriptive information keywords photo making file image searchable computer Internet
Some metadata created camera input photographer software downloading computer
Most digital camera write metadata model number shutter speed enable edit functionality available Nikon DSLRs since new Canon camera since Pentax DSLRs since Pentax
Metadata used make organizing easier use
Filters used analyze specific set photograph create selection criterion like rating capture time
Photographic Metadata Standards governed organization develop following standard
They include limited Information time origin destination phone call electronic message instant message mode telecommunication opposed message content another form metadata
Bulk collection metadata intelligence agency proven controversial disclosure Intelligence agency NSA keeping online metadata million internet user year regardless whether person interest agency
Metadata particularly useful video information content transcript conversation text description scene directly understandable computer efficient search content desirable
There two source video metadata derived operational gathered metadata information content produced type equipment software date location metadata improve search engine visibility discoverability audience engagement providing advertising opportunity video publisher
In today society professional video editing software access metadata
Avid MetaSync Adobe Bridge two prime example
Metadata created either automated information processing manual work
Elementary metadata captured computer include information object created created last updated file size file extension
In context refers following Data virtualization emerged new software technology complete virtualization stack enterprise
Metadata used data virtualization server enterprise infrastructure component alongside database application server
Metadata server saved persistent repository describe various enterprise system application
Structural metadata commonality also important support data virtualization
Standardization work large impact effort build metadata system statistical community
Several metadata standard described importance statistical agency discussed
Applications standard Census Bureau Environmental Protection Agency Bureau Labor Statistics Statistics Canada many others described
Emphasis impact metadata registry statistical agency
Metadata used various way mean cataloging item library digital analog format
Such data help classify aggregate identify locate particular book DVD magazine object library might hold collection
Until many library catalogue used inch card file drawer display book title author subject matter abbreviated string indicated physical location book within library shelf
The employed library classification library material subject early example metadata usage
Beginning many library replaced paper file card computer database
These computer database make much easier faster user keyword search
Another form older metadata collection use US Census Bureau known Long Form
The Long Form asks question used create demographic data find pattern distribution
employ metadata commonly part
Metadata obtained resource book periodical DVDs web page digital image
This data stored integrated library management system using metadata standard
The purpose direct patron physical electronic location item area seek well provide description question
More recent specialized instance library metadata include establishment including repository digital image library
While often based library principle focus use especially providing metadata mean follow traditional common cataloging approach
Given custom nature included material metadata field often specially created
taxonomic classification field location field keywords copyright statement
Standard file information file size format usually automatically included
Library operation decade key topic effort toward
Standards metadata digital library include schema
Leading library world give hint metadata standard strategy
Metadata museum context information trained cultural documentation specialist museum create index structure describe identify otherwise specify work art architecture cultural object image
Descriptive metadata commonly used museum context object identification resource recovery purpose
Metadata developed applied within collecting institution museum order Many museum cultural heritage center recognize given diversity art work cultural object single model standard suffices describe catalogue cultural work
For example sculpted Indigenous artifact could classified artwork archaeological artifact Indigenous heritage item
The early stage standardization archiving description cataloging within museum community began late development standard CDWA Spectrum CRM
These standard use markup language machine processing publication implementation

Most collecting institution museum use categorize cultural work image
Relational database metadata work document describe complex relationship amongst cultural object work art well object place people artistic movement
Relational database structure also beneficial within collecting institution museum allow archivist make clear distinction cultural object image unclear distinction could lead confusing inaccurate search
An object materiality function purpose well size measurement height width weight storage requirement environment focus museum collection influence descriptive depth data attributed object cultural documentarians
The established institutional cataloging practice goal expertise cultural documentarians database structure also influence information ascribed cultural object way cultural object categorized
Additionally museum often employ standardized commercial collection management software prescribes limit way archivist describe artwork cultural object
As well collecting institution museum use describe cultural object artwork collection
reputable within museum community recommended CCO standard
Museums encouraged use controlled vocabulary contextual relevant collection enhance functionality digital information system
Controlled Vocabularies beneficial within database provide high level consistency improving resource retrieval
Metadata structure including controlled vocabulary reflect system created
Often process cultural object described categorized metadata museum reflect perspective maker community
Metadata instrumental creation digital information system archive within museum made easier museum publish digital content online
This enabled audience might access cultural object due geographic economic barrier access
In museum adopted archival standard created intricate database discussion museum database come museum archival library science community
Collection Management Systems CMS tool local shared system
scholar note many benefit interoperability museum database collection also acknowledging difficulty achieving interoperability
Problems involving metadata becoming widespread
Courts looked various question involving metadata including metadata party
Although Federal Rules Civil Procedure specified rule electronic document subsequent case law elaborated requirement party reveal metadata
In October ruled metadata record
Document metadata proven particularly important legal environment litigation requested metadata include sensitive information detrimental certain party court
Using clean redact document mitigate risk unwittingly sending sensitive data
This process partially see protects law firm potentially damaging leaking sensitive data
In Australia need strengthen national security resulted introduction new metadata storage law
This new law mean security policing agency allowed access two year individual metadata aim making easier stop terrorist attack serious crime happening

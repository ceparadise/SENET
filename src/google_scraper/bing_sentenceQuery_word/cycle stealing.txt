Learn something new every day email Cycle stealing action computer process directly access get resource needed complete process
This normally occurs computer used CPU take advantage downtime run needed process
When process need resource generally take quite bit time get system considerably shortens search
While system proven useful way generally lead system degradation cause part computer become incapable reaching CPU
These error fact CPUs typically perform similar task without problem mean cycle stealing commonly used
Desktop computer sometimes laptop often kept day even people directly using
While many people use computer often use computer hour straight
This result downtime system used cycle stealing occur computer ability
This stealing process often take much computer resource would lead poor speed person accessing program time
When process need CPU often go somewhat long chain event
The process begin getting bus protocol held last process get resource
After CPU go clock cycle release memory go back bus process
In cycle stealing process skip go directly clock cycle CPU
Completing long process user away many benefit cycle stealing system proved ineffective widespread usage
This constant use CPU lead system degradation
Slower processing one smaller problem inability certain memory channel connect CPU larger problem
Beyond failure cycle stealing another reason system commonly used
Some CPUs able divide power different bus little reason function newer computer available
Computers also used workday business usually want computer day save electricity much time process directly take resource CPU
One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In cycle stealing mode CPU idle data transfer peripheral device idle cycle shifting bus control
Because I unable understand line
The DMA module transferring character rate character per second

The DMA therefore steal every cycle
Now I think line make sense assume CPU blocked cycle DMA transfer
Please anyone help I wrong I missing something
The CPU stay idle
It give control data Bus DMA memory cycle
DMA transfer data cycle consistent transfer rate
Meanwhile CPU perform operation involve memory bus mean cache memory register
In scenario presented assuming instruction take cycle complete every instruction wait DMA complete operation

We encounter cycle stealing context Direct Memory Access DMA
Either DMA controller use data bus CPU need may force CPU temporarily suspend operation
The latter technique called cycle stealing
Note cycle stealing done specific break point instruction cycle

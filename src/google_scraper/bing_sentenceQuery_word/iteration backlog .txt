An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Iteration programming mean repeating step
This often called loop
Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step This make designing algorithm quicker simpler need include lot unnecessary step

I always impression Sprint Backlog part Product Backlog impossible add anything Sprint Backlog without affecting Product Backlog However according one comment backlog completely different artifact We using electronic Scrum board would possible add thing like item Retrospective Sprint backlog avoid messing Product backlog
The Product Owner owns Product Backlog prioritizes behalf stakeholder
The property Team sole arbiter content
The Sprint Backlog contains user story popped top Product Backlog Sprint Planning
However Sprint Backlog usually contains many thing Product Backlog The Sprint Goal story accepted current Sprint set Spring Planning task occasionally story Sprint Backlog updated modified Team whatever way see fit Team artifact manage support Sprint Goal
While story accepted Sprint Backlog Sprint Planning generally fixed team finish early encouraged pull additional work Product Backlog believe fit current Sprint without compromising Sprint Goal
In addition sometimes additional knowledge information come light Sprint Team Product Owner cooperatively remove story Sprint help Team meet current Sprint Goal
In addition user story starting point conversation stakeholder Product Owner done proxy adding deleting task Sprint Backlog story worked quite common
Part art Scrum differentiating refinement come reducing cone uncertainty Sprint change story jeopardize Sprint Goal
Generally Sprint Backlog item decomposition Product Backlog item supporting task glue together story current Sprint
Again art differentiating task Team need create Sprint Backlog support Sprint Goal versus story need placed Product Backlog
As example story requires seed database may need add task Sprint Backlog install new database server
Usually task would added Sprint Planning task may become obvious later Sprint
In case perfectly acceptable add task Sprint Backlog Team story beyond properly belong Product Backlog
For example setting database architecture story prioritized Product Owner prerequisite story Product Backlog
These type story generally added Backlog Grooming occasionally Sprint Planning treated like story Product Backlog
W ould possible add thing like item Retrospective Sprint backlog avoid messing Product backlog
It depends
If Sprint Retrospective lead process change task Team course thing added one backlog
Tasks internal process belong Sprint Backlog consume time resource outside individual story estimate belong Product Backlog
Do afraid messing Product Backlog
The Product Backlog inviolate unchangeable document
A healthy Scrum process encourage ongoing conversation Product Owner Team encourage adding infrastructure story Product Backlog cost benefit visible project organization
You completely incorrect impression Sprint Backlog
The Product Backlog tool used product owner keep track feature stakeholder would like see implemented product whereas Sprint Backlog subset Product Backlog representing current active Sprint iteration
From A product backlog list desired product feature weather plan implement
Anyone add anything Product Backlog time
However product owner prioritizes
So I add feature request add quote day feature product product owner could well put bottom stack meaning really intend feature added
The Sprint backlog list backlog item completed current iteration
The Sprint Backlog hand represents current Sprint iteration Sprint begin one adding removing anything Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog put together team case clear team selecting item top Product Backlog
If something Product Backlog Sprint Backlog
If someone later want add feature Y list high priority item still go Product Backlog important enough feature product owner move top Product Backlog likely selected next Sprint iteration
The hierarchical relationship Product backlog sprint backlog caused iteration configuration timeline making sprint iteration child release iteration
Each timeline one Backlog iteration would normally associated Product Backlog
I ca think advantage making parent iteration
By associating timeline defined Backlog iteration get special status
Adding iteration hierarchy probably crufts thing layer navigate picking iteration example
It may also cause issue display plan may see Product Backlog purpose may make harder work

We using Team System since TFS initially created Team Project product used MSF process template eventually tweaked slightly added field work item type
Roll forward present day run TFS VS
Taking account past experience community feedback move single Team Project Scrum use area separate product team
The following link make good reading approach A typical layout plan applying area would along line Conceptually pretty happy logical environment
According would team follows Client A Team Client B Team We figured team big make administration manageable want define team per product since physically team per client oversee product client
Is mistake OK
Asuming team configuration OK correct map area team
For team Client A Team specify area Client A area owned team
What default area ok set root Client A area default team
As iteration layout plan something similar like This seems trickier get iteration right especially come TFS showing backlog
Specifically TFS Scrum Iteration setup seems I selecting check box leaf level iteration planning subsequent development
So extending example might Client A Team available start work new Product B next week assume week sprint
Would select check box Sprint Sprint Release
Am I correctly
Team Backlog Iteration selection This might problematic due concept team per client team per product maybe I understand wrong
In TFS Areas setup specify iterationis Backlog iteration team
My problem PBI Product Backlog Items product specific wish mix PBIs another product
So I unable understand yet impact select area Client A Backlog iteration team instead perhaps Product B
I think I confusing would sensible choice
The question stem lack understanding impact selection iteration area team backlog iteration default area TFS team defined
Some issue I setup TFS correctly identity product backlog sprint backlog team
I know whether one team project multiple area product generally recommended complicating issue
TFS Web Access website For given team WORK work item Shared Queries predefined query folder called Current Sprint Blocked Tasks Sprint Backlog etc seems query hardcoded Root automatically discover current sprint given date defined iteration
If best practice maintaining query
Do know quality TFS Scrum specific training tutorial might help address question give guidance successful Scrum TFS setup
I hope found use post I would also recommend take look
Here best effort answer question Question We figured team big make administration manageable want define team per product since physically team per client oversee product client
Is mistake OK
This fine allow grow team
If team member work across multiple Clients may run prioritisation context switching issue minimise pushing team level single unified backlog separate sub team still focusing client work product work
I would indeed recommend approach layout
Question Assuming team configuration OK correct map area team
For team Client A Team specify area Client A area owned team
What default area ok set root Client A area default team
That indeed correct result work item created team selected default
Many organisation also create parent master backlog misc item created ordered divided appropriate team backlog Greg Boer Product Owner TFS Agile Planning Tools blogged post
You layout iteration indeed looking good long Teams cross boundary client start getting difficultly mapping Areas Iterations Teams
If think may need single Team group team map one client may need something like While still dynamic would enable scenario
I would however still retain source control structure filter
It simply compartmentalisation planning process nessesarily spill part ALM Solution
Question This seems trickier get iteration right especially come TFS showing backlog
Specifically TFS Scrum Iteration setup seems I selecting check box leaf level iteration planning subsequent development
So extending example might Client A Team available start work new Product B next week assume week sprint
Would select check box Sprint Sprint Release
Am I correctly
You really looking Sprints actionable backlog part Scrum process
I would recommend sequentially numbering sprint consecutively UI get confused Sprint also tick Sprint called Sprint
It also nice keep tally experience level current team
But fundamentally correct technical process involved result achieve
Question Team Backlog Iteration selection This might problematic due concept team per client team per product maybe I understand wrong
In TFS Areas setup specify iteration Backlog iteration team
My problem PBI Product Backlog Items product specific wish mix PBIs another product
So I unable understand yet impact select area Client A Backlog iteration team instead perhaps Product B
I think I confusing would sensible choice
You confusing person entering something backlog team need change default product want change
At least default getting correct Team easy thing either person entering item Product Owner Team Member category correctly
Anything area specify Team Default default included item see
You default Area team see top level technic used Greg Master Backlog
I would however suggest want maintain setting visibility transparency within team
I know whether one team project multiple area product generally recommended complicating issue
It
Some organisation prefer add list work item like template use team designation configured Agile Planning Tools configuration default
That way need Team designation Area Iteration hitting
I recommendation either way without information organisation configured
Question TFS Web Access website For given team WORK work item Shared Queries predefined query folder called Current Sprint Blocked Tasks Sprint Backlog etc seems query hardcoded Root automatically discover current sprint given date defined iteration
If best practice maintaining query
Option Each Sprint spend minute take change query Option Create tool Option Have additional iteration node within Release move currently active iteration node
Then set query point A
Then quicker change nested iteration query work
You need change Current per Release
Do know quality TFS Scrum specific training tutorial might help address question give guidance successful Scrum TFS setup
I would recommend Professional Scrum Developer training engaging ALM Consultant
Related question thing regarding TFS structuring project team MrHinsh following blog post using TFS Teams allocating Area
It without caution though

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I reading book Software Requirements Karl Wiegers
And sentence Project team build product incrementally following agile development process also need understand requirement goin increment
What Increment Incrementally mean
In context increment iteration refer making relatively small change program rebuilding redeploying
One core idea agile want aim frequent rapid iteration
In agile typically want program buildable shippable time
It may terribly useful always want thing actually build ship right away people start testing giving feedback opposed waterfall approach one really try whole thing finished
Then add feature one time though one may take anywhere day couple week maybe even month
In many place release made end sprint
period week associated short list task team aim get done time
An increment context small piece functionality
To build incrementally mean completing potentially releasing work small bit time opposed one large release
Iteration refers small cycle work go able release incrementally
They related interchangeable term
I read title usually someone say build software incrementally referring delivering functionality iteration
There different approach lot mean starting developing minimum set delivering customer responding functionality
Repeat project competition
The idea type approach small burst work reevaluating make sure still moving best direction
This allows development team respond change better
I like idea incrementally building something adding part iterative way building part feedback loop

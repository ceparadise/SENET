A new computer program generate infinite amount original music
We different melodic pattern different rhythm different instrument combination every kind emotion
Computers used making music decade
Today indispensable element rap electronica many kind popular music
They imitate instrument generate drum loop mix match element like sample top new material
However kind computerized music require human programmer tell computer exactly
In respect computer really like conventional instrument
In contrast Molina computer program called Inmamusys short Intelligent Multiagent Music System actually put music together
Although human programmer loaded Inmamusys kind information music theory computer need programmer create new tune
It spontaneously noodle around within guideline given resulting music person claim created
Inmamusys composition likely win Grammys score hit
Without human artist behind ca convey specific point view deeply felt emotion
Instead sound like pleasant background music might hear store hold telephone
In fact type setting Inmamusys created
You see even though really pay attention music hear situation company using background music pay royalty composer
For fee purchase software Molina system could generate infinite amount background music free clear royalty potentially saving big buck
Of course human musician may reason worry Inmamusys since musician get surprisingly large chunk income Muzak version radio hit background music compose order
On hand Molina suggests software could help human composer get stuck writing new song perhaps providing random hint song could go next
If inspiration pay musician could use without fear getting sued virtual collaborator

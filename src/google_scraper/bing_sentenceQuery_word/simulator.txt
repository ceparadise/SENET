reproduce behavior system using
Computer simulation become useful tool mathematical modeling many natural system human system
Simulation system represented running system model
It used explore gain new insight new estimate performance system complex
Computer simulation either small running almost instantly small device program run hour day group computer
The scale event simulated computer simulation far exceeded anything possible perhaps even imaginable using traditional mathematical modeling
Over year ago simulation one force invading another involved modeling tank truck vehicle simulated terrain around using multiple supercomputer High Performance Computer Modernization Program
Other example include model material deformation model complex organelle living organism complete simulation life cycle project Switzerland begun May create first computer simulation entire human brain right molecular level
Because computational cost simulation used perform inference
A algorithm equation used capture behavior system modeled
By contrast computer simulation actual running program contains equation algorithm
Simulation therefore process running model
Thus one would build simulation instead one would build model either run model equivalently run simulation
Computer simulation developed rapid growth computer following first deployment model process
It simulation using
Computer simulation often used adjunct substitute modeling system simple possible
There many type computer simulation common feature attempt generate sample representative scenario model complete enumeration possible state model would prohibitive impossible
The external data requirement simulation model vary widely
For input might number example simulation waveform AC electricity wire others might require terabyte information weather climate model
Input source also vary widely Lastly time data available varies Because variety diverse simulation system many common element large number specialized simulation language
The may sometimes called year proposed
There
Systems accept data external source must careful knowing receiving
While easy computer read value text binary file much harder knowing compared value
Often expressed error bar minimum maximum deviation value range within true value expected lie
Because digital computer mathematics perfect rounding truncation error multiply error useful perform error analysis confirm value output simulation still usefully accurate
Even small error original data accumulate substantial error later simulation
While computer analysis subject GIGO restriction especially true digital simulation
Indeed observation inherent cumulative error digital system main catalyst development
Computer model classified according several independent pair attribute including Another way categorizing model look underlying data structure
For simulation two main class Equations define relationship element modeled system attempt find state system equilibrium
Such model often used simulating physical system simpler modeling case dynamic simulation attempted
Formerly output data computer simulation sometimes presented table matrix showing data affected numerous change simulation
The use matrix format related traditional use matrix concept
However psychologist others noted human could quickly perceive trend looking graph even generated data displayed CGI animation
Although observer could necessarily read number quote math formula observing moving weather chart might able predict event see rain headed way much faster scanning table
Such intense graphical display transcended world number formula sometimes also led output lacked coordinate grid omitted timestamps straying far numeric data display
Today model tend balance view moving cloud map us numeric coordinate numeric timestamps event
Similarly CGI computer simulation simulate might shrink change extended period medical treatment presenting passage time spinning view visible human head tumor change
Other application CGI computer simulation developed graphically display large amount data motion change occur simulation run
Generic example type computer simulation science derived underlying mathematical description Specific example computer simulation follow Notable sometimes controversial computer simulation used science include used Thomas Ray

design simulation developed
Special care taken handle event situation simulation equation valid changed
The open project started develop reusable library simulation together complete graphical environment generates code based library
Computer simulation used wide variety practical context The reliability trust people put computer simulation depends simulation therefore crucial importance development computer simulation
Another important aspect computer simulation reproducibility result meaning simulation model provide different answer execution
Although might seem obvious special point attention random number actually number
An exception reproducibility simulation flight simulation
Here human part simulation thus influence outcome way hard impossible reproduce exactly
manufacturer make use computer simulation test safety feature new design
By building copy car physic simulation environment save hundred thousand dollar would otherwise required build test unique prototype
Engineers step simulation millisecond time determine exact stress put upon section prototype
used display result computer simulation
used experience simulation
In case animation may also useful faster even slower mode
For example faster animation useful visualizing buildup queue simulation human evacuating building
Furthermore simulation result often aggregated static image using various way
In debugging simulating program execution test rather executing natively detect far error hardware detect time log useful debugging information instruction trace memory alteration instruction count
This technique also detect similar hard detect error well produce performance information data
Although sometimes ignored computer simulation important perform ensure accuracy result properly understood
For example probabilistic risk analysis factor determining success oilfield exploration program involves combining sample variety statistical distribution using
If instance one key parameter net ratio stratum known one significant figure result simulation might precise one significant figure although might misleadingly presented four significant figure
The following three step used produce accurate simulation model calibration verification validation
Computer simulation good portraying comparing theoretical scenario order accurately model actual case study match actually happening today
A base model created calibrated match area studied
The calibrated model verified ensure model operating expected based input
Once model verified final step validate model comparing output historical data study area
This done using statistical technique ensuring adequate value
Unless technique employed simulation model created produce inaccurate result useful prediction tool
Model calibration achieved adjusting available parameter order adjust model operates simulates process
For example traffic simulation typical parameter include distance sensitivity discharge headway lost time
These parameter influence driver behavior long take driver change lane much distance driver leaf car car front quickly driver start accelerate intersection
Adjusting parameter direct effect amount traffic volume traverse modeled roadway network making driver le aggressive
These example calibration parameter match characteristic observed field study location
Most traffic model typical default value may need adjusted better match driver behavior specific location studied
Model verification achieved obtaining output data model comparing expected input data
For example traffic simulation traffic volume verified ensure actual volume throughput model reasonably close traffic volume input model
Ten percent typical threshold used traffic simulation determine output volume reasonably close input volume
Simulation model handle model input different way traffic enters network example may may reach desired destination
Additionally traffic want enter network may able congestion exists
This model verification important part modeling process
The final step validate model comparing result expected based historical data study area
Ideally model produce similar result happened historically
This typically verified nothing quoting statistic fit
This statistic measure fraction variability accounted model
A high value necessarily mean model fit data well
Another tool used validate model graphical residual analysis
If model output value drastically differ historical value probably mean error model
Before using model base produce additional model important verify different scenario ensure one accurate
If output reasonably match historic value validation process model reviewed updated produce result line expectation
It iterative process help produce realistic model
Validating traffic simulation model requires comparing traffic estimated model observed traffic roadway transit system
Initial comparison trip interchange quadrant sector large area interest
The next step compare traffic estimated model traffic count including transit ridership crossing contrived barrier study area
These typically called screenlines cutlines cordon line may imaginary actual physical barrier
Cordon line surround particular area city central business district major activity center
Transit ridership estimate commonly validated comparing actual patronage crossing cordon line around central business district
Three source error cause weak correlation calibration input error model error parameter error
In general input error parameter error adjusted easily user
Model error however caused methodology used model may easy fix
Simulation model typically built using several different modeling theory produce conflicting result
Some model generalized others detailed
If model error occurs result may necessary adjust model methodology make result consistent
In order produce good model used produce realistic result necessary step need taken order ensure simulation model functioning properly
Simulation model used tool verify engineering theory valid calibrated properly
Once satisfactory estimate parameter model obtained model must checked assure adequately perform intended function
The validation process establishes credibility model demonstrating ability replicate actual traffic pattern
The importance model validation underscore need careful planning thoroughness accuracy input data collection program purpose
Efforts made ensure collected data consistent expected value
For example traffic analysis typical traffic engineer perform site visit verify traffic count become familiar traffic pattern area
The resulting model forecast better data used model estimation validation

Computer simulation pioneered scientific tool meteorology nuclear physic period directly following World War II since become indispensable growing number discipline
The list science make extensive use computer simulation grown include astrophysics particle physic material science engineering fluid mechanic climate science evolutionary biology ecology economics decision theory medicine sociology epidemiology many others
There even discipline chaos theory complexity theory whose existence emerged alongside development computational model study
After slow start philosopher science begun devote attention role computer simulation science
Several area philosophical interest computer simulation emerged What structure epistemology computer simulation
What relationship computer simulation experiment
Does computer simulation raise issue philosophy science fully covered recent work model generally
What computer simulation teach u emergence
About structure scientific theory
About role fiction scientific modeling
No single definition computer simulation appropriate
In first place term used narrow broad sense
In second place one might want understand term one point view
In narrowest sense computer simulation program run computer us method explore approximate behavior mathematical model
Usually model system although system question might imaginary hypothetical one
Such computer program
One run program computer computer simulation system
The algorithm take input specification state value variable time It calculates system state time
From value characterizing second state calculates system state time
When run computer algorithm thus produce numerical picture evolution system state conceptualized model
This sequence value model variable saved large collection data often viewed computer screen using method visualization
Often certainly always method visualization designed output scientific simulation appears measuring system interest
Sometimes method computer simulation used model interest contains continuous differential equation specify continuous rate change time solved principle perhaps practice
This underwrites spirit following definition given Paul Humphreys method exploring property mathematical model analytic method available
But even narrow definition one read carefully taken suggest simulation used analytically unsolvable equation model
Computer simulation often used either original model contains discrete directly implemented algorithm suitable original model consists something better described
In former case equation discretized turning equation describe continuous rate change discrete equation emphasized although common speak simulation solving equation discretization best find something approximates solution continuous equation desired degree accuracy
Finally speaking computer simulation narrowest sense speaking particular implementation algorithm particular digital computer written particular language using particular compiler etc
There case different result obtained result variation particular
More broadly think computer simulation comprehensive method studying system
In broader sense term refers entire process
This process includes choosing model finding way implementing model form run computer calculating output algorithm visualizing studying resultant data
The method includes entire make inference target system one try well procedure used sanction inference
This le definition computer simulation Winsberg
Successful simulation study compute number
They make use variety technique draw inference number
Simulations make creative use calculational technique motivated
As unlike simple computation carried computer result simulation automatically reliable
Much effort expertise go deciding simulation result reliable When philosopher science write computer simulation make claim epistemological methodological property computer simulation usually mean term understood broad sense computer simulation study
Both definition take computer simulation fundamentally using computer solve approximately solve mathematical equation model meant represent real hypothetical
Another approach try define simulation independently notion computer simulation define computer simulation compositionally simulation carried programmed digital computer
On approach simulation system believed hoped dynamical behavior similar enough system former studied learn latter
For example study object believe sufficiently dynamically similar basin fluid u learn basin fluid studying provides simulation basin fluid
This line definition simulation find Hartmann something imitates one process another process
In definition term process refers solely object system whose state change time
Hughes objected Hartmann definition ruled simulation imitate structure rather dynamic
Humphreys revised definition simulation accord remark Hartmann Hughes follows Note Humphreys defining computer simulation simulation generally spirit defining compositional term
It noted Humphreys definition make simulation success term seems unfortunate
A better definition would one like one last section included word like believed hoped address issue
In philosophical discussion computer simulation useful concept one defined
The exception explicitly goal discussion understand computer simulation example simulation generally see section
Examples simulation computer simulation include famous physical model San Francisco Bay Huggins Schultz
This working hydraulic scale model San Francisco Bay Joaquin River Delta System built Army Corps engineer study possible engineering intervention Bay
Another nice example discussed extensively Dardashti et al
forthcoming use acoustic dumb hole made condensate study behavior Black Holes
Physicist Bill Unruh noted certain fluid something akin black hole would arise region fluid moving fast wave would move faster speed sound something order escape Unruh
Such region would effect sonic event horizon
Unruh called physical setup dumb hole dumb mute proposed could studied order learn thing know black hole
For time proposal viewed nothing clever idea physicist recently come realize using condensate actually build study dumb hole laboratory
It clear think setup simulation dumb hole simulates black hole
Instead finding computer program simulate black hole physicist find fluid dynamical setup believe good model model fundamental mathematical similarity model system interest
They observe behavior fluid setup laboratory order make inference black hole
The point definition simulation section try understand sense computer simulation sort activity specie genus
We might better situation understand simulation sense happens run computer overlap simulation sense
We come back section
Barberousse et al
however critical analogy
They point computer simulation work way Unruh simulation work
It case computer material object target system follow differential equation
A good reference simulation computer simulation Trenholme
Two type computer simulation often distinguished
Computer Simulations type used three different general sort purpose prediction pointwise understanding exploratory heuristic purpose
simulation commonly used physical science science governing theory guide construction mathematical model based differential equation
I use term equation based refer simulation based kind global equation associate physical opposed rule evolution discussed next section
Equation based simulation either n many discrete body set differential equation governing interaction set equation governing time evolution continuous medium field
An example former simulation galaxy formation gravitational interaction finite collection discrete body discretized time space
An example latter simulation fluid meteorological system like severe storm
Here system treated continuous field representing distribution relevant variable space discritized space updated discrete interval time
simulation common social behavioral science though also find discipline artificial life epidemiology ecology discipline networked interaction many individual studied
simulation similar simulation represent behavior discrete individual
But unlike simulation global differential equation govern motion individual
Rather simulation behavior individual dictated local rule To give one example famous groundbreaking simulation Thomas Schelling model The agent simulation individual lived chessboard
The individual divided two group society
two different race boy girl smoker etc
Each square board represented house one person per house
An individual happy certain percent neighbor group
Happy agent stay unhappy agent move free location
Schelling found board quickly evolved strongly segregated location pattern agent happiness rule specified segregation heavily favored
Surprisingly however also found initially integrated board tipped full segregation even agent happiness rule expressed mild preference neighbor type
In section discussed model based particle method based field method
But simulation model hybrid different kind modeling method
Multiscale simulation model particular couple together modeling element different scale description
A good example would model simulates dynamic bulk matter treating material field undergoing stress strain relatively coarse level description zoom particular region material important small scale effect taking place model smaller region relatively modeling method
Such method might rely molecular dynamic quantum mechanic description matter offered treating material field
Multiscale simulation method broken serial multiscale parallel multiscale method
The traditional method serial modeling
The idea choose region simulate lower level description summarize result set parameter digestible higher level model pas part algorithm calculating higher level
Serial multiscale method effective different scale strongly coupled together
When different scale interact strongly produce observed behavior required approach simulates region simultaneously
This called parallel multiscale modeling
Parallel multiscale modeling foundation nearly ubiquitous simulation method called modeling
modelingrefers representation important physical process occur adequately resolved grid size particular simulation
Remember many simulation discretize continuous equation relatively arbitrary finite grid In study turbulence fluid example common practical strategy calculation account missing fall inside grid cell
This done adding motion characterizes transport dissipation energy feature occurs small scale captured grid
In climate science kindred discipline modeling called This refers method replacing complex physically represented simple mathematical description
This opposed flow calculated grid level accordance basic theory
It called parameterization various needed drive highly approximative algorithm compute value
Examples parameterization climate simulation include descent rate raindrop rate atmospheric radiative transfer rate cloud formation
For example average cloudiness km grid box cleanly related average humidity box
Nonetheless average humidity increase average cloudiness also could parameter linking average cloudiness average humidity inside grid box
Even though parameterizations cloud formation sophisticated basic idea well illustrated example
The use modeling method simulation important consequence understanding structure epistemology simulation
This discussed greater detail section
modelling method contrasted another kind parallel multiscale model algorithm theoretically principled motivated theory different level description
In example simulation bulk matter mentioned example algorithm driving smaller level description built
The algorithm driving smaller level actually theoretically principled higher level sense physic fundamental quantum mechanic molecular dynamic continuum mechanic
These kind multiscale model word cobble together resource theory different level description
So provide interesting example provoke thinking intertheoretic relationship challenge view inconsistent set law model
In scientific literature another large class computer simulation called Monte Carlo MC Simulations
MC simulation computer algorithm use randomness calculate property mathematical model randomness algorithm feature target model
A nice example use random algorithm calculate value π
If draw unit square piece paper inscribe circle randomly drop collection object inside square proportion object land circle would roughly equal
A computer simulation simulated procedure like would called MC simulation calculating π
Many philosopher science deviated ordinary scientific language shied away thinking MC simulation genuine simulation
Weirich offer following reasoning The Monte Carlo approach mimetic purpose It imitates deterministic system order serve surrogate investigated stead order offer alternative computation deterministic system property
This show MC simulation fit definition aptly
On hand divide philosopher ordinary language perhaps squared noting MC simulation simulate imaginary process might used calculating something relevant studying process
Suppose I modeling planetary orbit calculation I need know value π
If I MC simulation mentioned last paragraph I simulating process randomly dropping object square I modeling planetary orbit
This sense MC simulation simulation simulation system used study
However Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources point MC simulation viz
use MC technique solve stochastic dynamical equation referring physical system fact simulation system study
There three general category purpose computer simulation put
Simulations used heuristic purpose purpose predicting data generating understanding data already
Under category heuristic model simulation subdivided used communicate knowledge others used represent information
When Watson Crick played tin plate wire latter first former showed result others
When army corp built model San Francisco Bay convince voting population particular intervention dangerous using kind heuristic purpose
Computer simulation used kind explore feature possible representational structure communicate knowledge others
For example computer simulation natural process bacterial reproduction tectonic shifting chemical reaction evolution used classroom setting help student visualize hidden structure phenomenon process impractical impossible costly illustrate wet laboratory setting
Another broad class purpose computer simulation put telling u expect system real world behave particular set circumstance
Loosely speaking computer simulation used prediction
We use model predict future retrodict past use make precise prediction loose general one
With regard relative precision prediction make simulation slightly finegrained taxonomy
There Point prediction Where planet Mars October
b Qualitative global systemic prediction Is orbit planet stable
What scaling law emerges kind system
What fractal dimension attractor system kind
c Range prediction It likely global mean surface temperature increase degree C year highly likely sea level rise least two foot implausible thermohaline shut next year
Finally simulation used understand system behavior
If already data telling u system behaves use computer simulation answer question event could possibly occurred event actually occur
When thinking topic next section epistemology computer simulation also keep mind procedure needed sanction result simulation often depend large part kind purpose purpose simulation put
As computer simulation method gained importance discipline issue trustworthiness generating new knowledge grown especially simulation expected counted epistemic peer experiment traditional analytic theoretical method
The relevant question always whether result particular computer simulation accurate enough intended purpose
If simulation used weather predict variable interested degree accuracy sufficient meet need consumer
If simulation atmosphere Midwestern plain used structure severe thunderstorm confidence structure one play explanatory role account storm sometimes split two sometimes form depicted accurately enough support confidence explanation
If simulation used engineering design prediction made simulation reliable enough sanction particular choice design parameter sanction belief particular design airplane wing function
Assuming answer question sometimes yes
kind inference least sometimes justified central philosophical question justifies
More generally claim simulation good enough intended purpose evaluated
These central question epistemology computer simulation EOCS
Given confirmation theory one traditional topic philosophy science might seem obvious latter would resource begin approach question
Winsberg however argued come topic related credentialing knowledge claim philosophy science traditionally concerned justification theory application
Most simulation hand extent make use theory tends make use theory
EOCS word rarely testing basic theory may go simulation often establishing credibility hypothesis part result application theory
Winsberg argued unlike epistemological issue take center stage traditional confirmation theory adequate EOCS must meet three condition
In particular must take account fact knowledge produced computer simulation result inference

EOCS must reflect fact large number case accepted scientific theory starting point construction computer simulation model play important role justification inference simulation result conclusion target system
The word downward meant signal fact unlike scientific inference traditionally interested philosopher move observation instance theory inference drawn part high theory particular feature phenomenon

EOCS must take account simulation result nevertheless typically depend theory many model ingredient resource well including parameterizations discussed numerical solution method mathematical trick approximation idealization outright fiction ad hoc assumption function library compiler computer hardware perhaps importantly blood sweat tear much trial error

EOCS must take account autonomy knowledge produced simulation sense knowledge produced simulation sanctioned entirely comparison observation
Simulations usually employed study phenomenon data sparse
In circumstance simulation meant replace experiment observation source data world relevant experiment observation reach principled practical ethical reason
Parker forthcoming made point usefulness condition somewhat compromised fact overly focused simulation physical science discipline simulation
This seems correct
In social behavioral science discipline simulation see norm model built absence established quantitative theory EOCS probably ought characterized term
For instance social scientist use simulation pursue methodology social phenomenon example observed pattern like segregation explained accounted generating similar looking phenomenon simulation Epstein Axtell Epstein
But raise sort epistemological question
What exactly accomplished kind knowledge acquired observed social phenomenon le reproduced simulation
Does count explanation phenomenon
A possible explanation
see
It also fair say Parker forthcoming condition outlined pay insufficient attention various differing purpose simulation used discussed
If using simulation make detailed quantitative prediction future behavior target system epistemology inference might require stringent standard involved inference made general qualitative behavior whole class system
Indeed also fair say much work could done classifying kind purpose computer simulation put constraint purpose place structure epistemology
Frigg Reiss argued none three condition new computer simulation
They argued ordinary paper pencil modeling incorporate feature
Indeed argued computer simulation could possibly raise new epistemological issue epistemological issue could cleanly divided question appropriateness model underlying simulation issue identical epistemological issue arise ordinary modeling question correctness solution model equation delivered simulation mathematical question one related epistemology science
On first point Winsberg replied simultaneous confluence three feature new simulation
We return second point section Some work EOCS developed analogy computer simulation order draw recent work epistemology experiment particularly work Allan Franklin
see entry
In work epistemology experiment Alan Franklin identified number strategy experimenter use increase rational confidence result
Weissart Parker argued various form analogy strategy number strategy available simulationists sanction result
The detailed analysis relationship found Parker also us analogy highlight weakness current approach simulation model evaluation
Winsberg also make use Ian Hacking work philosophy experiment
One central insight experiment captured slogan experiment life
Hacking intended convey two thing slogan
The first reaction unstable picture science come example Kuhn
Hacking suggests experimental result remain stable even face dramatic change part science
The second related point intended convey experiment organic develop change yet retain certain development make u talk repeating replicating experiment
Some technique simulationists use construct model get credentialed much way Hacking say instrument experimental procedure method credential develop extended period time become deeply
In Hacking language technique set assumption simulationists use become
Perhaps better expression would carry credential
This provides response problem posed understanding simulation could viable epistemology despite motley autonomous nature inference
Drawing inspiration another philosopher experiment Mayo Parker suggests remedy shortcoming current approach simulation model evaluation
In work Parker suggests Mayo approach understanding traditional make use notion severe test shed light epistemology simulation
The central question epistemology simulation perspective becomes What warrant taking computer simulation severe test hypothesis natural world
That warrant concluding simulation would unlikely give result fact gave hypothesis interest false
Parker belief much pass simulation model evaluation lack rigor structure Drawing explicitly upon Mayo work argues epistemology simulation ought instead offering account canonical error arise well strategy probing presence
Practitioners simulation particularly engineering context weapon testing climate science tend conceptualize EOCS term
said process determining whether output simulation approximates true solution differential equation original model
hand said process determining whether chosen model good enough representation system purpose simulation
The literature verification validation engineer scientist enormous beginning receive attention philosopher
Verification divided solution verification code verification
The former verifies output approximates true solution differential equation original model
The latter verifies code written carry intended algorithm
Code verification mostly ignored philosopher science probably seen problem computer science empirical mistake
Part solution verification consists comparing computed output analytic solution called benchmark solution
Though method course help make case result computer simulation since simulation often used precisely analytic solution unavailable region solution space interest
Other indirect technique available important probably checking see whether rate computed output converges stable solution time spatial resolution discretization grid get finer
The principal strategy validation involves comparing model output observable data
Again course strategy limited case simulation run observable data sparse
But complex strategy employed including comparing output subsystem simulation relevant experiment Parker forthcoming Oberkampf Roy
The concept verification validation drawn criticism philosopher
Oreskes et al
article mostly critical terminology arguing validity particular property applies logical argument hence term applied model might lead overconfidence
Winsberg argued conceptual division verification validation misleading taken suggest one set method show solved equation right another set method show got right equation
He also argued misleading think epistemology simulation cleanly divided empirical part verification mathematical computer science part validation
But misleading idea often follows discussion verification validation
We find work practitioner philosopher
Here standard line practictioner Roy Verification deal mathematics address correctness numerical solution given model
Validation hand deal physic address appropriateness model reproducing experimental data
Verification thought solving chosen equation correctly validation choosing correct equation first place Roy
Some philosopher put distinction work argument philosophical novelty simulation
We first raised issue section Frigg Reiss argued simulation could epistemologically novel feature since contained two distinct component component identical epistemology ordinary modeling component entirely mathematical
We distinguish two different notion reliability answering two different question
First solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful purely mathematical question fall within class problem mentioned
So nothing new philosophical point view question indeed one number crunching
Second computational model basis simulation represent target system correctly
That simulation result externally valid
This serious question one independent ﬁrst problem one equally arises connection model involve intractable mathematics ordinary experiment Frigg Reiss
But verification validation strictly speaking cleanly separable
That method validation much weak establish validity simulation
And model equation chosen simulation straightforward sense right equation model equation would choose ideal world
We good reason think word model equation enjoy better empirical support abstract
The equation choose often reflect compromise think best describes phenomenon computational tractability
So equation chosen rarely well validated
If want understand simulation result taken credible look epistemology simulation integrated whole cleanly divided verification would look inadequate task
So one point verification validation separable activity
But point two independent entity onto activity directed model chosen discretized method discretizing
Once one recognizes equation solved sometimes chosen cancel discretization error etc
Lenhard nice example involving Arakawa operator later distinction get harder maintain
So success achieved simulation kind piecemeal adjustment model method calculation
And case hard even know mean say simulation separately verified validated
No one argued V V useful distinction rather scientist overinflate pragmatically useful distinction clean methodological dictate misrepresents messiness practice
Collaterally Frigg Reiss argument absence epistemological novelty simulation fails reason
It purely mathematical question whether solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful
At least respect question answered pragmatic matter entirely using mathematical method
And hence issue arise ordinary modeling
Working scientist sometimes describe simulation study experimental term
The connection simulation experiment probably go back far von Neumann advocating early use computer physic noted many difficult experiment conducted merely determine fact ought principle derivable theory
Once von Neumann vision became reality experiment began replaced simulation became somewhat natural view version experiment
A representative passage found popular book simulation The idea silico experiment becomes even plausible simulation study designed learn happens system result various possible intervention What would happen global climate amount carbon added atmosphere
What happen airplane wing subjected strain
How would traffic pattern change onramp added location
Philosophers consequently begun consider sense computer simulation like experiment sense differ
A number view emerged literature centered around defending criticizing two thesis
Computer simulation study literally instance experiment

The identity thesis would true good reason weak version best reason stronger version reason strongest version necessary condition believe simulation provide warrant belief hypothesis support
A consequence strongest version identity thesis true reason believe simulation confer warrant believing hypothesis
The central idea behind epistemological dependence thesis experiment canonical entity play central role warranting belief scientific hypothesis therefore degree ought think simulation also play role warranting belief depends extent identified kind experiment
One find philosopher arguing identity thesis early Humphreys Hughes
And least implicit support stronger version epistemological dependence thesis Hughes
The earliest explicit argument favor epistemological dependence thesis however Norton Suppe
According Norton Suppe simulation warrant belief precisely literally experiment
They detailed story tell sense experiment supposed work
According Norton Suppe valid simulation one certain formal relation call realization hold base model modeled physical system computer running algorithm
When proper condition met simulation used instrument probing detecting real world phenomenon
Empirical data real phenomenon produced condition experimental control
One problem story formal condition set much strict
It unlikely many real example computer simulation meet strict standard
Simulation almost always far idealizing approximating enterprise
So simulation experiment probably way Norton Suppe imagined
More generally identity thesis drawn fire quarter
Gilbert Troitzsch argued major difference experiment one controlling actual object interest example chemistry experiment chemical investigation simulation one experimenting model rather phenomenon Gilbert Troitzsch
But seem right
Many Guala Morgan Parker Winsberg pointed problem claim
If Gilbert Troitzsch mean simulationists manipulate model sense abstract object claim difficult manipulate abstract entity
If hand simply mean point fact physical object simulationists digital actual object interest clear differs ordinary experiment
It false real experiment always manipulate exactly target interest
In fact real experiment simulation complex relationship manipulated investigation one hand system target investigation
In case experiment simulation therefore take argument substance establish external validity investigation establish learned system manipulated applicable system interest
Mendel example manipulated pea plant interested learning phenomenon heritability generally
The idea biology make idea perspicuous
We experiment interested understanding organism general use gene control development genealogy
We experiment provides useful model mutation genetic inheritance
But idea limited biology
Galileo experimented inclined plane interested object fall would behave absence interfering inclined plane experiment even actually instantiate
Of course view experiment uncontested
It true quite often experimentalists infer something system distinct system interfere
However clear whether inference proper part original experiment
Peschard mount criticism along line hence seen defender Gilbert Troitzsch
Peschard argues fundamental assumption experimentation simulation manipulated system standing target confused
It confuses Peshard argues experiment She argues epistemic motivation experiment might quite proper epistemic target experiment worm
In simulation according Peschard however epistemic target never digital computer
Thus simulation distinct experiment according epistemic target opposed merely epistemic motivation distinct object manipulated
Other opponent identity thesis include Giere Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources
It clear adjudicate dispute seems revolve primarily around difference emphasis
One emphasize experiment simulation following Gilbert Troitzsch Peschard insisting experiment teach u first epistemic target secondarily allow inference behavior system
experiment worm teach u first instance worm secondarily allow u make inference genetic control generally
This would make conceptually different computer simulation thought teach u first instance behavior computer second instance storm galaxy whatever
Or one emphasize opposite way
One emphasize degree experimental target always chosen surrogate really interest
Morrison probably forceful defender emphasizing aspect similarity experiment simulation
She argues experimental practice indeed measurement practice involve kind modeling practice simulation
In case pace Peschard nothing debate maybe appeal ordinary language use scientist always compelling kind prevent u saying epistemic target storm simulation computer storm merely epistemic motivation studying computer
Be may many philosopher simulation including discussed section chosen latter way drawing attention way message lurking behind Gilbert Troitzch quoted claim paint overly simplistic picture experiment
It seem overly simplistic paint picture according experiment get world whereas situation
And picture one seems get Gilber Troitzsch quotation
Peschard sophisticated picture involving distinction epistemic target epistemic motivation go long way towards smoothing concern without pushing u territory thinking simulation experiment regard
Still despite rejecting Gilbert characterization difference simulation experiment Guala Morgan reject identity thesis
Drawing work Simon Guala argues simulation differ fundamentally experiment object manipulation experiment bear material similarity target interest simulation similarity object target merely formal
Interestingly Morgan accepts argument identity thesis seems hold version
She argues word difference experiment simulation identified Guala implies simulation epistemologically inferior real experiment intrinsically le power warrant belief hypothesis real world experiment
A defense epistemic power simulation Morgan argument could come form defense identity thesis form rejection epistemological dependency thesis
On former front seem two problem Guala argument identity thesis
The first notion material similarity weak second notion mere formal similarity vague required work
Consider example fact uncommon engineering science use simulation method study behavior system fabricated silicon
The engineer want learn property different design possibility silicon device develops computational model device run simulation behavior digital computer
There deep material similarity material cause work central processor computer silicon device studied
On Gaula line reasoning mark example real experiment seems wrong
The peculiarity example illustrate problem rather starkly problem fact quite general two system bear material similarity difference
On flip side idea existence formal similarity two material entity could mark anything interesting conceptually confused
Given two sufficiently complex entity many way formally identical mention similar
There also way formally completely different
Now speak loosely say two thing bear formal similarity really mean best formal representation two entity formal similarity
In case appear good ground rejecting Gilbert Troitzsch Morgan Guala ground distinguishing experiment simulation
Returning defense epistemic power simulation also ground rejecting epistemological dependence thesis
As Parker point experiment simulation relevant similarity computer simulation target system matter
When relevant background knowledge place simulation provide reliable knowledge system experiment
A computer simulation solar system based sophisticated model celestial dynamic produce better representation planet orbit experiment
Paul Humphreys argued computer simulation profound implication understanding structure theory argues reveal inadequacy semantic syntactic view scientific theory
This claim drawn sharp fire Roman Frigg Julian Reiss
Frigg Reiss argue whether model admits analytic solution bearing relates world
They use example double pendulum show
Whether pendulum inner fulcrum held fixed fact determine whether relevant model analytically solvable bearing semantics element model
From conclude semantics model relates world unaffected whether model analytically solvable
This responsive however charitable reading Humphreys pointing
The syntactic semantic view theory account abstract scientific representation relate world
More particularly story relation particular model world rather relation world role model played relation
They also story lot say philosophically interesting action come scientific theorizing
The syntactic view suggested scientific practice could adequately rationally reconstructed thinking theory axiomatic system importantly logical deduction useful regulative ideal thinking inference theory world drawn
The syntactic view also omission made fairly clear modeling played anything role science
This feature syntactic view theory Frederick Suppe one ardent critic often railed
Theories nothing model theory could compared world without important role modeling play
The semantic view theory hand emphasize important role model also urged theory entity
It urged philosopher distracted contingency particular form linguistic expression theory might found say particular textbook
Computer simulation however seem illustrate theme misguided
It profoundly wrong think logical deduction right tool rationally reconstructing process theory application
Computer simulation show method theory application vastly outstrip inferential power logical deduction
The space solution example available via logical deduction theory fluid microscopic compared space application explored via computer simulation
On flip side computer simulation seem reveal Humphreys urged syntax matter
It wrong turn suggest semantic view particular linguistic form scientific theory expressed philosophically uninteresting
The syntax theory expression deep effect inference drawn kind idealization work well etc
Humphreys put point follows specific syntactic representation used often crucial solvability theory equation Humphreys
The theory fluid used emphasize point whether express theory Eulerian Lagrangian form deeply affect practice calculate affect idealization approximation calculational technique effective reliable circumstance
So epistemology computer simulation need sensitive particular syntactic formulation theory well particular formulation credentialed
Hence seem right emphasize Humphreys computer simulation revealed inadequacy syntactic semantic theory
Paul Humphreys Mark Bedau argued philosopher interested topic emergence learn great deal looking computer simulation
Philosophers interested topic consult entry contribution philosopher discussed
The connection emergence simulation perhaps best articulated Bedau
Bedau argued conception emergence must meet twin hallmark explaining whole depends part whole independent part
He argues philosopher often focus call strong emergence posit brute downward causation irreducible principle
But argues mistake
He focus instead call weak emergence reducibility whole part
Systems produce emergent property mere mechanism mechanism complex many independently interacting part
As result way figure exactly happen given specific set initial boundary condition except crawl causal web
It connection computer simulation arises
Weakly emergent property characteristic complex system nature
And also characteristic complex computer simulation way predict except let run
Weak emergence explains according Bedau computer simulation play central role science complex system
The best way understand predict real complex system behave simulate crawling web see happens
Models course involve idealization
But argued kind idealization play especially prominent role kind modeling involved computer simulation point deserve title This section discus attempt define fiction explore role computer simulation
There two different line thinking role fiction science
According one model fiction
This line thinking motivated considering role example ideal pendulum science
Scientists argued often make claim sort entity ideal pendulum period proportional length nowhere found real world hence must fictional entity
This line argument fictional entity science connect special way computer interested topic consult entry scientific representation forthcoming
Another line thinking fiction concerned question sort representation science ought regarded fictional
Here concern much ontology scientific model entity representational character various postulated model entity
Here Winsberg argued fiction special connection computer simulation
Or rather computer simulation contain element best typify might call fictional representation science even representation uniquely present simulation
He note first conception make representation contradicts reality fiction correspond ordinary use term rough map fiction
He proposes alternative definition nonfiction offered good enough guide part world fiction
But definition need refined
Take fable grasshopper ant
Although fable offer lesson world still fiction useful guide way world general sense rather specific guide way part world prima facie representational target singing grasshopper toiling ant
Nonfictions hand point certain part world guide part world
These kind fictional component model paradigmatically exemplified certain computer simulation
Two example silogen atom artificial Silogen atom appear certain nanomechanical model crack specie kind multiscale model blend quantum mechanic molecular mechanic mentioned section
The silogen containing model crack propagation silicon work describing crack using quantum mechanic region immediately surrounding crack using classical molecular dynamic
To bring together modeling framework two region boundary get treated contains silogen atom mixture property silicon hydrogen
Silogen atom fiction
They offered even good enough description atom prima facie representational target
But used overall model hoped get thing right
Thus overall model fiction one component
Artificial viscosity similar sort example
Fluids abrupt shock difficult model computational grid abrupt shock hide inside single grid cell resolved algorithm
Artificial viscosity technique pretend fluid highly shock shock becomes le abrupt blur several grid cell
Getting viscosity hence thickness shock wrong help get overall model work well Again overall model fluid fiction reliable enough guide behavior fluid
But component called artificial viscosity used reliably model shock
It incorporated larger modeling framework make larger framework reliable This account drawn two sort criticism
Toon argued definition fiction narrow
He give example historical fiction like argues fiction despite fact offered good enough guide people place event certain respect entitled take
Toon presumably support broader conception role fiction science according play particularly prominent heightened role computer simulation
Gordon Purves forthcoming argues example fiction computational model example imaginary crack elsewhere meet strict requirement discussed
Unlike Toon however also want delineate fictional modeling element one
His principal criticism criterion fictionhood term social norm Purves argues ought able settle whether piece modeling fiction absence norm
Thus want find intrinsic characterization scientific fiction
His proposal take constitutive model fiction fail characteristic Laymon called piecewise improvability PI
PI characteristic many model idealization say model becomes accurate
But silogen atom get accurate simulation silicon crack
But Purves take failure PI constitutive fiction rather merely symptomatic

VIDEOPLACE could analyze process user action real world translate interaction system virtual object various preprogrammed way
Different mode interaction name like finger painting digital drawing suggest aesthetic dimension system
VIDEOPLACE differed several aspect training research simulation
In particular system reversed emphasis user perceiving computer generated world computer perceiving user action converting action object space within virtual world
With emphasis shifted responsiveness interaction Krueger found representation became le important interaction participant rapidity response image form sensory input
The ability manipulate virtual object see central presentation compelling virtual significance data glove emergence VR commerce popular
Data glove relay user hand finger movement VR system translates wearer gesture manipulation virtual object
The first data glove developed project funded called Sayre Glove one team member
In Thomas Zimmerman invented first optical glove Gary Grimes constructed Digital Data Entry Glove first glove sufficient flexibility inertial sensor monitor hand position variety application providing keyboard input data entry
Zimmerman glove would greatest impact
He thinking year constructing interface device musician based common practice playing air guitar particular glove capable tracking hand finger movement could used control instrument electronic synthesizer
He patented optical device used fibre one year Grimes patented computer interface device
By Zimmerman working Atari Research Center Sunnyvale California along Scott Fisher Brenda Laurel VR researcher would active beyond
Jaron Lanier another researcher Atari shared Zimmerman interest
Beginning worked together improving design data glove left Atari start VPL Research first commercial product VPL DataGlove
By Fisher also left Atari join NASA Ames Research Center Moffett Field California founding director Virtual Environment Workstation VIEW project
The VIEW project put together package objective summarized previous work artificial environment ranging creation multisensory immersive virtual environment workstation telepresence teleoperation application
Influenced range prior project included Sensorama flight simulator arcade ride surprised expense air force Darth Vader helmet Fisher group focused building personal simulation environment
While objective NASA develop telerobotics automated space station future planetary exploration group also considered use entertainment scientific educational purpose
The VIEW workstation called Virtual Visual Environment Display completed established standard suite VR technology included stereoscopic display head tracker speech recognition imagery data glove audio technology
The brought market October year appeared cover
VPL also spawned system called DataSuit display called EyePhone shared VR system two people called Reality Built Two
VPL declared June Virtual Reality On day VPL Autodesk publicly demonstrated first commercial VR system
The Autodesk VR CAD system based VPL technology scaled operation
The marketing splash introduced Lanier new term realization cyberspace concept introduced writer
Lanier dreadlocked chief executive officer VPL became public celebrity new VR industry announcement Autodesk VPL let loose torrent enthusiasm speculation marketing hype
Soon seemed VR everywhere PowerGlove HMD movie Nintendo VirtualBoy game system television series
Numerous VR company founded early energy unleashed VPL Autodesk marketing campaign dissipated
The VR configuration took shape span project leading Sutherland data glove multimodal sensory input broad appeal quickly enthusiast predicted
Instead visible successfully marketed product entertainment system rather personal VR system
These VR arcade simulator designed team game movie simulation theme park industry combined attribute video game amusement park ride highly immersive storytelling
Perhaps important early project Disneyland Star Tours immersive flight simulator ride based movie series designed collaboration producer Industrial Light Magic
long built themed ride utilizing advanced technology animatronic Pirates Caribbean attraction originally installed Disneyland
Star Tours utilized simulated motion technology mixing technique learned Hollywood film military flight simulator strong story line architectural element shaped viewer experience moment entered waiting line attraction
After opening Star Tours Walt Disney Imagineering embarked series project apply interactive technology immersive environment ride system including used DisneyQuest indoor interactive theme park virtual world
In Virtual World Entertainment opened first emporium Chicago
Modeled loosely military system networked training simulator centre put player individual pod essentially cockpit served immersive interactive console narrative competitive game experience
All vehicle represented game controlled player pod linked network set simultaneous multiplayer experience
The player immersion virtual world competition resulted combination element including carefully constructed story line physical arcade space pod networked virtual environment
During centre constructed city around world franchise also expanded home book toy television
While Disney Virtual World Entertainment project instance VR entertainment important project included Iwerks Entertainment Turbo Tour Turboride motion simulator theatre first installed producer Gameworks arcade first opened joint project Dreamworks SKG many individual VR arcade ride beginning Sega Arcade gyroscope flight simulator released finally Visions Reality VR arcade spectacular failure contributed bursting investment bubble VR venture
virtual reality world participant called resident avatar move graphical environment
Residents socialize participate group activity create trade virtual product virtual real service
Second Life currency Linden Dollar fantasy
The term coined refer interaction virtual world
game virtual reality spill physical world
The case popular electronic game several million player one example
Property acquired game sold online although secondary economy discouraged Blizzard Entertainment During computer game designer exploited graphic faster microprocessor networking handheld wireless game device Internet develop new genre video console personal computer networked environment
These included shooter game environment device processing storing displaying information
meant person computation term almost universally refers automated electronic machinery

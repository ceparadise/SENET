The assessment standard provide criterion judge progress toward science education vision scientific literacy
The standard describe quality assessment practice used teacher state federal agency measure student achievement opportunity provided student learn science
By identifying essential characteristic exemplary assessment practice standard serve guide developing assessment task practice policy
These standard applied equally assessment student teacher program summative formative assessment practice classroom assessment well external assessment
This chapter begin introduction describes component assessment process contemporary view measurement theory practice
This introduction followed assessment standard discussion way teacher use assessment characteristic assessment conducted district state national level
The chapter close two sample assessment task one probe student understanding natural world another probe ability inquire
In vision described assessment primary feedback mechanism science education system
For example assessment data provide student feedback well meeting expectation teacher parent teacher feedback well student learning district feedback effectiveness teacher program policy maker feedback well policy working
Feedback lead change science education system stimulating change policy guiding teacher professional development encouraging student improve understanding science
The assessment process effective tool communicating expectation science education system concerned science education
Assessment practice policy provide operational definition important
For example use extended inquiry assessment task signal student learn teacher teach resource allocated
Assessment systematic multistep process involving collection interpretation educational data
The four component assessment process detailed
As science educator changing way think good science education educational measurement specialist acknowledging change well
Recognition importance assessment contemporary educational reform catalyzed research development implementation new method data collection along new way judging data quality
These change measurement theory practice reflected assessment standard
In new view assessment learning two side coin
The method used collect educational data define measurable term teacher teach student learn
And student engage assessment exercise learn
This view assessment place greater confidence result assessment procedure sample assortment variable using diverse method rather traditional sampling one variable single method
Thus aspect science inquire scientific understanding natural world understanding nature utility measured using multiple method performance portfolio well conventional test
The assessment standard include increased emphasis measurement Figure
Components Assssment Process The four component combined numerous way
For example teacher use student achievement data plan modify teaching practice business leader use per caput educational expenditure locate business
The variety us user method data contributes complexity importance assessment process
opportunity learn
Student achievement interpreted light quality program experienced
Another important shift toward assessment
This movement call exercise closely approximate intended outcome science education
Authentic assessment exercise require student apply scientific knowledge reasoning situation similar encounter world outside classroom well situation approximate scientist work
Another conceptual shift within educational measurement area significant implication science assessment involves validity
Validity must concerned technical quality educational data also social educational consequence data interpretation
An important assumption underlying assessment standard state local district develop mechanism measure student achievement specified content standard measure opportunity learning science specified program system standard
If principle assessment standard followed information resulting new mode assessment applied locally common meaning value term national standard despite use different assessment procedure instrument different locale
This contrast traditional view educational measurement allows comparison based parallel form test
Assessments deliberately designed
Assessments explicitly stated purpose
The relationship decision data clear
Assessment procedure internally consistent
The essential characteristic assessment process used collect interpret data consistent purpose assessment
That match purpose process achieved thoughtful planning available public review
Educational data profoundly influence life student well people institution responsible science education
People must use result assessment make decision take action well affected decision action deserve assurance assessment carefully conceptualized
Evidence careful conceptualization found written plan assessment contain Statements purpose assessment serve
Descriptions substance technical quality data collected
Specifications number student school data obtained
Descriptions method
Descriptions method data interpretation
Descriptions decision made including make decision procedure
Conducting assessment activity
Routine assessment classroom place considerable demand time intellectual resource teacher student
assessment conducted district state federal government require tremendous human fiscal expenditure
Such resource expended assurance decision action follow increase scientific literacy assurance made purpose assessment clear
Assessments test assumption relationship among educational variable
For example purpose decide school district management system continued assessment data might collected student achievement
This choice assessment would based following assumed relationship management system give teacher responsibility selecting science program teacher incentive implement effectively program select effective implementation improves science achievement
The relationship decision made data collected specified
For assessment internally consistent component must consistent others
A link inference must established reasonable alternative explanation eliminated
For example district management example relationship management system student achievement adequately tested student achievement variable measured
The extent management system increased teacher responsibility led change science program could influence science achievement must also measured
Achievement data collected focus science content important student learn
data collected focus powerful indicator
Equal attention must given assessment opportunity learn assessment student achievement
The content standard define science student come understand
They portray outcome science education rich varied encompassing The ability inquire
Knowing understanding scientific fact concept principle law theory
Standards The Physical Science Content Standard includes understanding motion force
One supporting idea motion object described change position time
Students respond question frame reference extended written response diagram
This individual extended response exercise embedded teaching
The teacher us information activity improve lesson
Students written response
Teacher observation
A class studying motion object
One student describing idea motion force point book desk say right book moving
A second student interrupt Oh yes
The book desk desk floor floor part building building sitting Earth Earth rotating axis revolving around Sun whole solar system moving Milky Way
The second student sits back smile face
All discussion cease
signal time pose following question class
Imagine insect spider lily pad floating stream
The spider walking around edge lily pad
The insect sitting middle pad watching spider
How would insect describe motion
How would insect describe spider motion
How would bird sitting edge stream describe motion insect spider
After setting class work discussing question teacher walk around room listening discussion
asks student write answer question posed suggests student use diagram part response
The school principal observing class asked explain followed original lesson plan
explained girl made similar statement class twice
realized girl disruptive making legitimate point member class grasping
So decided continuing discussion motion force would fruitful class developed better concept frame reference
Her question designed help student realize motion described term point reference
The insect middle lily pad would describe motion motion spider term reference frame lily pad
In contrast bird watching edge stream would describe motion lily pad passenger term reference frame namely ground standing
Someone ground observing bird would say bird motion observer moon would different answer
The ability reason scientifically
The ability use science make personal decision take position societal issue
The ability communicate effectively science
This assessment standard highlight complexity content standard addressing importance collecting data aspect student science achievement
Educational measurement theory practice well developed primarily measure student knowledge subject matter therefore many educator policy analyst confidence instrument designed measure student command information science instrument designed measure student understanding natural world ability inquire
Many current science achievement test measure inert isolated bit active rich
Assessment process include outcome student achievement must probe extent organization student knowledge
Rather checking whether student memorized certain item information assessment need probe student understanding reasoning utilization knowledge
Assessment learning closely related outcome assessed teacher student likely redefine expectation learning science outcome assessed
The system program teaching professional development standard portray condition must exist throughout science education system student opportunity learn science
At classroom level powerful indicator opportunity learn teacher professional knowledge including content knowledge pedagogical knowledge understanding student extent content teaching professional development assessment coordinated time available teacher teach student learn science availability resource student inquiry quality educational material available
The teaching program standard define greater detail indicator opportunity learn
Some indicator opportunity learn origin federal state district level discussed greater detail system standard
Other powerful indicator opportunity learn beyond classroom include educational expenditure state science requirement graduation federal allocation fund state
Compelling indicator opportunity learn continually identified way collect data designed
Measuring indicator present many technical theoretical economic social challenge challenge obviate responsibility moving forward implementing assessing opportunity learn
The assessment standard call commitment resource necessary research development related assessing opportunity learn
That commitment includes development technical skill ass opportunity learn among science education professional including teacher supervisor administrator curriculum developer
Students held accountable achievement unless given adequate opportunity learn science
Therefore achievement opportunity learn science must assessed equally
The feature claimed measured actually measured
Assessment task authentic
An individual student performance similar two task claim measure aspect student achievement
Students adequate opportunity demonstrate achievement
Assessment task method presenting provide data sufficiently stable lead decision used different time
Standard C address degree data collected warrant decision action based
The quality decision appropriateness resulting action limited quality data
The serious consequence student teacher greater confidence making decision must technical quality data
Confidence gauged quality assessment process consistency measurement alternative assessment process
Judgments confidence based several different indicator discussed
The content form assessment task must congruent supposed measured
This validity
For instance assessment claim measure student ability frame question conducting scientific inquiry design inquiry address question format would appropriate task
Requiring student pose question design inquiry address would appropriate task
However purpose assessment task measure student knowledge characteristic distinguish group mineral format might suitable well efficient
When student engaged assessment task similar form task engage life outside classroom similar activity scientist great confidence attached data collected
Such assessment task authentic
Classroom assessment take many form including observation student performance instructional activity interview formal performance task portfolio investigative project written report multiple choice essay examination
The relationship form assessment task goal science education obvious others
For instance student ability obtain evaluate scientific information might measured using test identify source scientific information toxic waste
An alternative authentic method ask student locate information develop annotated bibliography judgment scientific quality information
This one aspect reliability
Suppose purpose assessment measure student ability pose appropriate question
A student might asked pose question situation set physical science
The student performance task consistent performance task set context life science assuming student equal opportunity learn physical life science
For decision maker confidence assessment data need assurance student opportunity demonstrate full understanding ability
Assessment task must developmentally appropriate must set context familiar student must require reading skill vocabulary inappropriate student grade level must free bias possible
This another aspect reliability especially important assessment change performance group interest
Only stable measure valid inference change group performance made
Although confidence indicator discussed focus student achievement data analogous set confidence indicator generated opportunity learn
For instance teacher quality indicator opportunity learn
Authenticity obtained teacher quality measured systematic observation teaching performance qualified observer
Confidence measure achieved number observation large enough teacher exhibit full range teaching knowledge skill
Consistency performance also established repeated observation
method take many form
Each advantage disadvantage
The choice among usually constrained tradeoff type quality amount information gained time resource requires
However serve intended purpose choice assessment form consistent one want measure infer
It critical data method collection yield information confidence level consistent consequence use
Public confidence educational data use related technical quality
This public confidence influenced extent technical quality considered educator policy maker skill communicate public
Assessment task must reviewed use stereotype assumption reflect perspective experience particular group language might offensive particular group feature might distract student intended task
assessment must use statistical technique identify potential bias among subgroup
Assessment task must appropriately modified accommodate need student physical disability learning disability limited English proficiency
Assessment task must set variety context engaging student different interest experience must assume perspective experience particular gender racial ethnic group
A premise student access quality science education expected achieve scientific literacy defined content standard
It follows process used ass student achievement must fair student
This ethical requirement also measurement requirement
If assessment result closely related gender ethnicity preparation received science understanding ability assessed validity assessment process questionable
Those plan implement science assessment must pay deliberate attention issue fairness
The concern fairness reflected procedure used develop assessment task content language assessment task process student assessed analysis assessment result
Statistical technique require sex different racial ethnic background included development assessment
Bias determined certainty combination statistical evidence expert judgment
For instance exercise ass understanding inertia using flywheel result differential performance female male judgment exercise biased might plausible based assumption male female different experience flywheel
Whether assessment large scale teacher conducted principle fairness requires method allow student physical disability learning disability limited English proficiency demonstrate full extent science knowledge skill
The requirement assessment exercise authentic thus context increase likelihood task degree bias population student
Some context appeal male others female
If however assessment employ variety task collection equally unfair
This one way deleterious effect bias avoided
When making inference assessment data student achievement opportunity learn science explicit reference need made assumption inference based
Even assessment well planned quality resulting data high interpretation empirical evidence result quite different conclusion
Making inference involves looking empirical data lens theory personal belief personal experience
Making objective inference extremely difficult partly individual always aware assumption
Consequently confidence validity inference requires explicit reference assumption inference based
For example science achievement assessment sample student certain population high several conclusion possible
Students population might highly motivated excellent instruction student population might greater opportunity learn science test might biased way favor student
Little confidence placed conclusion without clear statement assumption developed line reasoning evidence conclusion
The level confidence conclusion raised conducting assessment well trained process making inference educational assessment data
Even general public well professional demand open understandable description inference made
Teachers best position put assessment data powerful use
In vision science education described teacher use assessment data many way
Some way teacher might use data presented section
Teachers collect information student understanding almost continuously make adjustment teaching basis interpretation information
They observe critical incident classroom formulate hypothesis cause incident question student test hypothesis interpret student response adjust teaching plan
Teachers use assessment data plan curriculum
Some data teacher collected data come external source
The data used select content activity example incorporated course study module unit lesson
Teachers use assessment data make judgment The developmental appropriateness science content
Student interest content
The effectiveness activity producing desired learning outcome
The effectiveness selected example
The understanding ability student must benefit selected activity example
Planning assessment integral instruction
Assessments embedded curriculum serve least three purpose determine student initial understanding ability monitor student progress collect information grade student achievement
Assessment task used purpose reflect student expected learn elicit full extent student understanding set variety context practical aesthetic heuristic value meaning outside classroom
assessment task also provide important clue student important learn
Students need opportunity evaluate reflect scientific understanding ability
Before student need understand goal learning science
The ability understanding essential tool learning
Through student clarify idea supposed learn
They begin internalize expectation learn science
Developing skill ongoing process throughout student school career becoming increasingly sophisticated student progress
Conversations among teacher student assessment task teacher evaluation performance provide student necessary information ass work
In concert opportunity apply individual work work peer information contributes development student skill
By developing skill student become able take responsibility learning
Teachers communicated assessment practice standard performance criterion evaluation student student able Select piece work provide evidence understanding scientific concept principle ability conduct scientific inquiry
Explain orally writing illustration work sample provides evidence understanding
Critique sample work using teacher standard criterion quality
Critique work student constructive way
Involving student assessment process increase responsibility teacher
Teachers science representative scientific community classroom represent culture way thinking might quite unfamiliar student
As representative teacher expected model reflection fostering learning environment student review others work offer suggestion challenge mistake investigative process faulty reasoning poorly supported conclusion
A teacher formal informal evaluation student work exemplify scientific practice making judgment
The standard judging significance soundness creativity work professional scientific work complex arbitrary
In work classroom learning investigation teacher represent standard practice scientific community
When teacher treat student serious learner serve coach rather judge student come understand apply standard good scientific practice
An essential responsibility teacher report student progress achievement student colleague parent policy maker
Progress report provide information The teacher performance standard criterion evaluation
A student progress marking period marking period form year year
A student progress mastering science curriculum
A student achievement measured criterion
Each issue requires different kind information different mode assessment
Especially challenging teacher communicating parent policy maker new method gathering information gaining acceptance school
Parents policy maker need reassured newer method good better used school
Thus developing plan assessment strategy compile evidence student achievement teacher demonstrate alternative form data collection method interpreting valid reliable familiar test
The purported objectivity test highly valued newer mode assessment portfolio performance essay rely apparently subjective scoring method le trusted people professional educator
Overcoming lack trust requires teacher use assessment plan monitoring student progress grading
Clearly relating assessment task product student work valued goal science education integral assessment plan
Equally important plan explicit criterion judging quality student work policy maker parent understand
Master teacher engage practical inquiry teaching identify condition promote student learning understand certain practice effective
The teacher researcher engages assessment activity similar scientific inquiry collecting data answer question effective teaching practice
Engaging classroom research mean teacher develop assessment plan involve collecting data student opportunity learn well achievement
Science assessment conducted district state national authority serve similar purpose distinguished primarily number student teacher school data collected
Assessments may conducted authority external classroom purpose Formulating policy
Monitoring effect policy
Enforcing compliance policy
Demonstrating accountability
Making comparison
Monitoring progress toward goal
In addition purpose assessment conducted school district make judgment effectiveness specific program school teacher report taxpayer district accomplishment
The high cost external assessment influence science teaching practice demand careful planning implementation
assessment include teacher planning implementation
In addition data collected analyzed sample size well rationalized sample representative population interest
This section discus characteristic assessment
Far often educational data collected analyzed used make decision take action
assessment planner able describe data plan collect used improve science education
The development interpretation externally designed assessment monitoring educational system include active participation teacher
Teachers experience student make indispensable participant design development interpretation assessment prepared beyond classroom
Their involvement help ensure congruence classroom practice science education external assessment practice
Whether district state national level teacher science need work others make contribution assessment process educational researcher educational measurement specialist curriculum specialist educational policy analyst
The size sample data collected depends purpose assessment number student teacher school district state assessment plan address
If instance state conduct assessment learn student science achievement comparison student another state sufficient obtain data scientifically defined sample student state
If however purpose assessment give credit individual student science course data must collected every student
For assessment even district level information collected way minimize time demand individual student
For many accountability purpose sampling design employed different representative sample student receiving different set task
This permit many different dimension science education system monitored
Policy maker taxpayer make valid inference student achievement opportunity learn across nation state district without requiring extensive time commitment every student sample
To illustrate assessment standard two example provided
The content standard stated term understanding ability therefore first example understanding natural world
This example requires body scientific knowledge competence reason information make prediction develop explanation act scientifically rational way
The example focus prediction justifying prediction
The second example ability inquire also requires body scientific information competence reason conceptualize plan perform investigation
These assessment task content standard correspondence
The content standard call scientific understanding natural world
Such understanding requires knowing concept principle law theory physical life earth science well idea common across natural science
That understanding includes capacity reason knowledge
Discerning student know student reason possible without communication either verbal representational third essential component understanding
Inferences student understanding based analysis performance science classroom work product
Types performance include making class public presentation discussing science matter peer teacher conducting laboratory work
Products student work include examina tions journal note written report diagram data set physical mathematical model collection natural object
Communication fundamental performance assessment
Understanding take different perspective displayed different level sophistication
A physicist understanding respiration might quite different chemist cell biologist understanding respiration quite different physician
The physicist chemist biologist physician highly sophisticated understanding respiration
They bring many scientific principle bear concept
However likely give greater emphasis concept special significance particular discipline
A physicist emphasis might energetics little emphasis organism respiration take place
The physician hand might emphasize respiration specifically applies human
The context application also contributes difference perspective
The cell biologist understanding might focus mechanism respiration occurs cell physician understanding might focus human respiratory disorder physical pathological cause
An ordinary citizen understanding respiration much le sophisticated practicing scientist
However even citizen understanding different perspective reflecting difference experience exposure science
Legitimate difference perspective sophistication understanding also evident student scientific understanding natural world
A challenge teacher others responsible assessing understanding decide variability translated judgment degree individual student group understand natural world
The example follows illustrates explanation natural world rich source information student understand
Because explanation central scientific enterprise eliciting analyzing explanation useful way assessing science achievement
The example illustrates thoughtfully designed assessment exercise requiring explanation provide student opportunity demonstrate full range scientific understanding
Exercises sort designed learn whether student know particular fact concept rather tap depth breadth student understanding
Exercises sort difficult design challenge score
The example follows illustrates challenge
The assessment task begin prompt includes description task direction
The prompt read Many attribute make jar good exercise assessing understanding
The situation plant closed jar described student verbally diagram actual material thus eliminating reading barrier student response
The situation understood student age minimizing student prior knowledge situation factor ability respond
The explanation prediction developed many different level complexity qualitative quantitative
It based experience theory us idea physical life earth science well idea thus allowing student demonstrate full range understanding science various level study science
The process scoring explanation requires development scoring rubric
The rubric standard performance defined population
Typically scoring rubric developed teacher student target population
The performance standard developed consensus process called social moderation
The step designing scoring rubric involve defining performance standard scientifically literate adult deciding element standard appropriate student target population
The draft performance standard refined subsequent use student performance work
Finally student performance respect rubric differentiated
Performances rated satisfactory exemplary inadequate
Differences opinion rubric judgment quality student response moderated group teacher consensus reached rubric
Because target population identified rubric need function community develop section define rubric
Rather step developing rubric described
Developing scoring rubric begin description performance standard scientifically literate adult
That performance standard developed rubric development team
Members team write individual response exercise reflect belief scientifically literate adult respond
They also seek response adult
Based individual response team negotiates team response serf initial standard
The team standard analyzed component response
In exercise component prediction information used justify prediction reasoning used justify prediction quality communication
Examples prediction scientifically literate adult long plant live jar might include insufficient information make prediction plant live indefinitely insect disease might kill plant
Whatever prediction justified
For example assertion made information provided prompt insufficient make prediction explanation describe information needed make prediction information would used
Scientifically literate adult rely range knowledge justify prediction
The standard response developed team teacher include concept physical life earth science well unifying concept science
All applicable making justifying prediction life plant jar difference emphasis one person would expected use
Some concept evaporation condensation energy including heat light chemical energy conversion energy transmission chemical interaction catalysis conservation mass dynamic equilibrium physical science
Other concept life science plant physiology plant growth photosynthesis respiration plant disease plant insect interaction
Still concept earth science soil type composition atmosphere water cycle solar energy mineral cycle
Finally unifying concept might used predict justify prediction plant jar
Those might include closed open isolated system physical model pattern change conservation equilibrium
The knowledge required predict life plant jar limited single concept
A deeper understanding phenomenon could implied justification includes knowledge chemical specie energy
Keeping track energy C H O sugar CO carbon dioxide H O water O oxygen mineral requires knowing change undergo jar equilibrium among zone jar soil atmosphere
The jar content form closed system respect matter open system respect energy
The analysis life expectancy plant jar also requires knowing matter jar change form mass remains constant
In addition knowing gas atmosphere mineral soil become part plant important explanation
A deeper understanding science might inferred prediction justification included knowledge physical chemistry photosynthesis respiration
Photosynthesis process radiant energy visible light converted chemical bond energy form special carrier molecule ATP turn used store chemical bond energy carbohydrate
The process begin light absorption chlorophyll pigment give plant green color
In photosynthesis light energy used drive reaction Respiration process energy released chemical compound react oxygen
In respiration sugar broken produce useful chemical energy plant reaction Photosynthesis respiration complementary process photosynthesis result storage energy respiration release
Photosynthesis remove CO atmosphere respiration add CO atmosphere
A justification prediction life plant jar might include knowledge dynamic equilibrium
Equilibrium exists liquid vapor state water
The liquid water evaporates continuously
In closed container constant temperature rate condensation equal rate evaporation
The water state dynamic equilibrium
Another attribute justification relates assumption
The justification explicit assumption underlie even contain speculation concerning implication making alternative assumption
Finally justification prediction plant jar demonstrates reasoning characterized succession statement follow one another logically without gap statement statement
The assessment exercise appropriate prompt understanding plant grade level
Development scoring rubric student different grade level requires consideration science experience developmental level student
For instance justification student elementary school could expected based primarily experience plant
Student justification would contain little scientific terminology
A student might respond exercise following way Expectations justification constructed student grade different
These contain generalized knowledge use sophisticated language scientific concept light heat oxygen carbon dioxide energy photosynthesis
By grade level sophistication much higher
Ideally grader would see plant jar physical model Earth ecosystem view photosynthesis respiration complementary process
Setting performance standard population student depends population developmental level experience science
Considerations made using student response developing rubric illustrated discussing two justification constructed student completed biology
Student E constructed exemplary justification prediction plant jar
Student S constructed le satisfactory response completely missed point
O incomplete vaporization
This would shut root hair pressure plant allows water nutrient reach leaf
All plant live long day downhill
Judging quality information contained justification requires consensus information contained using certain standard compare information information rubric
Standards might applied include scientific accuracy information justification appropriateness knowledge student age experience sophistication knowledge appropriateness application knowledge situation
Foremost judgment quality information contained justification take account accuracy information student used crafting response
Student S justification contains misinformation water cycle dynamic equilibrium closed system
The statement inference made moisture soil likely start evaporate almost immediately
This leave soil dry air humid
Since closed container water restored soil condensation
The student statement soil container dry air humid suggests lack knowledge equilibrium closed system
In contrast Student S misinformation Student E justification contains information neither unusually sophisticated viewed content biology text erroneous
Judgments appropriateness information difficult make
A person familiar biology course student took might assert information student response sophisticated taught course
In case content biology course used standard rating quality response
Alternatively standard rating appropriateness information might scientific idea content standard
Student E response rated higher Student S basis quality information
Student S justification provides information student know provides evidence making inference structure student knowledge
For example student consider complementary relationship photosynthesis respiration crafting justification
Perhaps student know respiration process complementary
Alternatively two concept may stored memory way facilitate bringing bear exercise
Testing plausibility inference student knowledge structure would require conversation student
To learn student know respiration one simply ask
If student know apply making prediction evidence respiration understood context life process plant
Student E response well structured consistent prediction
The statement form connected progression
The prediction tentative justification indicates tentative due lack information prompt student uncertainty quantitative detail condition photosynthesis respiration occur
The student explicit certain assumption instance relationship mineral soil plant growth
The question student pose justification interpreted evidence alternative assumption considered
In contrast Student S prediction stated unwarranted assurance justified without consideration anything availability sufficient water
Furthermore justification proceed sequential way proceeding general principle empirical evidence justification prediction
Student S response highlight important point justifies separating scoring information scoring reasoning
A student compose justification using incorrect information
For instance student posed following justification reasoning would adequate even conclusion soil dry correct
The reasoning would rated higher student communicated Developing scoring rubric moderation requires highly informed teacher experienced process
Even teacher adequately prepared moderation process take time
The content standard call knowledge understanding
Considerable resource must therefore devoted preparing teacher others science education system design rate assessment require student display understanding described
The second assessment example focus inquiry
The content standard call understanding scientific inquiry developing ability inquire
As understanding natural world understanding inquiry contingent knowing concept principle law theory physical life earth science
Inquiry also requires reasoning capability skill manipulating laboratory field equipment
As understanding natural world inference student ability inquire understanding process based analysis performance science classroom work product
The example follows describes twelfth grade student participation extended inquiry
The exercise serf two purpose
It provides teacher information well student met inquiry standard
Equally important serf capstone experience school science program
The extended inquiry introduced early school year
It involves student working individual small group investigating question choice
Throughout school science program student encouraged identify question interest amenable investigation
These question recorded student research notebook
Early senior year high school student prepare draft statement question propose investigate discus question reasonable one
Those draft circulated member class
Students prepare written review classmate proposal commenting quality research question rationale investigating
Students revise research question based peer feedback
Finally student present defend revised question class
The teacher encourages require student work together research group two four student
After presenting research question class student form research group come agreement question investigate begin developing preliminary plan conducting investigation
Each individual group required keep extensive record group work especially documenting evolution final research question several question originally proposed
As plan investigation evolve research question sharpened modified meet practical constraint time resource available class
Each student maintains journal note process
When group satisfied plan progressed point work begin plan presented classmate
Written copy plan distributed written review followed class seminar discus research plan
On basis peer feedback group revise research plan recognizing plan implemented require still revision
Each student class responsible reviewing research plan every group including written critique recommendation modifying plan
During phase extended investigation student engage iterative process involving assembling testing apparatus designing testing form data collection developing testing data collection schedule collecting organizing interpreting data
Based note individual group prepares written report describing research
That report also includes data collected preliminary analysis
Based peer feedback group modify procedure continue data collection
When group convinced method working data reasonably consistent analyze data draw conclusion
After seminar research group present data analysis conclusion group prepares first draft research report
This draft circulated classmate preparation individual critique
This feedback used group prepare final report
While class engaged extended investigation teacher observes student performance student make presentation class interacts peer us computer laboratory apparatus
In addition teacher product individual student work well group work including draft research question critique student work individual student research notebook
Those observation student performance work product rich source data teacher make inference student understanding scientific idea nature scientific inquiry
For instance context planning inquiry student pose question investigation
Their justification question scientific one provide evidence infer extent quality understanding nature science understanding natural world understanding life physical earth science well quality extent scientific knowledge capacity reason scientifically
Evidence quality student ability reason scientifically come rationale student research question line reasoning used progress pattern collected data conclusion
In first instance student distills research question understanding scientific idea associated natural phenomenon
In second instance student generates scientific information based data
In either case quality reasoning inferred well connected chain reasoning explicit student assumption made extent speculation implication made alternative assumption made
The writing speaking requirement extended investigation provide ample evidence assessing ability student communicate scientific idea
The envision change throughout system
The assessment standard encompass following change emphasis Assessing easily measured Assessing highly valued Assessing discrete knowledge Assessing rich knowledge Assessing scientific knowledge Assessing scientific understanding reasoning Assessing learn student know Assessing learn student understand Assessing achievement Assessing achievement opportunity learn End term assessment teacher Students engaged ongoing assessment work others Development external assessment measurement expert alone Teachers involved development external assessment Baron

Avenue Edouard Belin Toulouse France This paper try address problem defining effectiveness interaction term useful meeting human need directly term task outcome interaction quality
The problem effectiveness generally considered objective standpoint assessment considers nominal outcome interaction rather subjective qualitity interaction standpoint participant
This lead case meeting room produce highly effective result better faster decision le commitment participant
The problem understanding effectiveness particularly acute domain aviation high social cost failure
The concept effectiveness long difficult problem interaction community even always addressed directly
The Handbook Interaction even index effectiveness efficiency
Some aspect interaction relatively easier model
For example extensive literature efficiency pointing captured Fitts Law see
But activitives reasonable approach effectiveness difficult come
For interaction typical measure effectiveness task outcome
But approach fundamental limitation particularly quality interaction issue
measure poor choice task use interface little effect task completion rate
Likewise interaction interface flight system produce produce extremely low effective error rate task outcome poor measure effectiveness
For example research improving flight interface used crew aircraft paradoxically hindered happy fact flight result incident accident
Thus current approach effectiveness direct measure effectiveness unhelpful better percent crew land plane safely b time completion generally consequence factor interface weather control
Current approach measurement effectiveness thus tend indirect measure element associated effectiveness rather effectiveness
In aircraft interface domain example cockpit management attitude questionnaire CMAQ valuable assessed attitude linked output factor like performance
Similarly aircrew coordination scale measured crew behavior later related causally mishap although different skill found important different crew task
There two major flaw approach
First usually depend expert rating performance rather direct empirical measurement
Second measure process input instead process output indirect b unhelpful trying determine input
In particular present problem effectiveness measure presumably used evaluate new procedure interface characterized indirect input factor validity relationship input output may simply function procedure interface formed basis study
We may end maximizing possibly ineffective input instead output effectiveness
In word methodological limitation end possibly misleading designer interface thus producing potentially result field strong public interest operation commercial aircraft b potentially unpleasant aversive interaction user
Subject measure effectiveness quesionnaires also suspect
First clear user necessarily good judge effectiveness interaction may rely indirect index
Second measure considered
For example interface video game might considered effective found involving sense compelling user attention interest
This would poor measure flight interface however crew plenty thing need attend
In summary problem faced current approach measurement human effectiveness direct measure unhelpful almost task outcome successful indirect measure usually rely judgment vulnerable weak relationship input output subjective measure unreliable
Given need develop validate methodology measurement human effectiveness research challenge find effectiveness measure practical theoretically enough reliable extensible
These problem particularly acute domain cockpit environment
I suggest useful research agenda would involve development methodological model
In particular I begin proposition effectiveness measurement technique ought The path achieving goal obvious part due risk reward
It expected research direct measure present higher risk higher potential relative research indirect measure familiar clearly easier execute
Consequently funding agency may seek pursue approach looking direct indirect measure view producing result pursuing active chance result
Looking specifically possible methodology developing direct measure effectiveness particular cockpit environment I suggest might possible decompose flight task smaller piece whole flight intermediate result
This would involve conducting reachable state
I expect produce measurable error rate outcome
In particular error detection correction rate relatively high particularly task positive outcome
I also expect practice incidence minor unreported error almost always corrected high could used successfully overall measure
In word maybe notion task redefined smaller scale everyday phenomenon interaction detected
If case taken step toward useful definition quality interaction

The study conducted randomized controlled crossover trial among general practice Capital Region Denmark
The intervention consisted sending computer reminder ComRem practice adhering guideline recommendation split testing hemoglobin glucose
Practices randomly allocated two group
During first period one group received ComRem intervention together general implementation activity GIA group received GIA
For second period intervention switched two group
Outcomes measured split test procedure adherence
A total practice randomly allocated early intervention group practice late intervention group control group first period
In first intervention period mean number split test performed group receiving ComRem group increased eight possible test mean number split test increased group targeted GIA p
After crossover similar effect reminder observed
Furthermore development outcome measure time showed strong effect computer reminder beyond intervention period
There significant effect computer reminder adherence quality assessment scheme testing
Thus computer reminder seem useful supporting implementation relatively simple procedure quality safety

The test GP characteristic account clustering GPs practice
Within last ten year several systematic review assessed effect computer reminder regard changing provider behavior
The recent Cochrane review find effect computer reminder small moderate due variation different type reminder intervention result review concludes needed identify type reminder work
On background purpose randomized controlled trial RCT ass effectiveness ComRem improving adherence quality assessment scheme POCTs
The study took place Capital Region Denmark
A detailed description study protocol presented elsewhere
A total practice total GPs eligible study area total population million
Only general practice conducting least five POCTs either hemoglobin practice conduct POCT International Normalised Ratio INR baseline period included study
The reason excluding practice conducted INR practice included another RCT effect computer reminder versus postal reminder
The practice identified via database Laboratory Capital Region
Because intervention part formal implementation activity sanctioned Capital Region Laboratory sample study included relevant practice irrespective wish participate
The quality assessment guideline recommend split test procedure practice month POCT type
In split test procedure POCT result compared result blood sample patient analyzed Laboratory
The quotient two result ideally quotient lay within interval hemoglobin glucose acceptable
The result analysis sent general practice
If practice respond case unacceptable deviation sending new split test Laboratory asks practice
If result still deviate much Laboratory contact practice help locate problem
In Laboratory generally stepped implementation activity concerning external quality assessment POCT general practice
First importance performing split test emphasized annual facilitator visit practice well three laboratory newsletter
Second technical change introduced made easier practice order split test particularly April ordering procedure fully digitalized
During intervention period facilitator informed allocation status clinic prior visit
In Danish healthcare sector common standard secure electronic communication MedCom healthcare provider use decade
Within MedCom general practice allocated unique location number electronic communication fed GPs electronic patient journal system
When electronic journal system accessed GP appointed staff system show communication must opened approved
Hence computer reminder study neither postal reminder traditional
Practices randomly allocated two group stratified practice characteristic group versus single handed geographic location
The randomization done mean random number using SAS version
The randomization performed data manager Research Unit General Practice without knowledge individual practice identification
The allocation procedure concealed project group conducted independent organization Danish College General Practitioners
At enrolment project group delivered practice code information regarding stratification college designated staff conducted allocation returned information project group
During first period one allocated group Early ComRem received ComRem intervention together GIA group Late ComRem received GIA
For second period ComRem intervention switched two group practice would receive ComRem overall study period
This crossover chosen order accommodate scientific interest control group receive intervention wish Laboratory Capital Region practice received reminder intervention point study period order increase overall adherence
At time crossover design provided u opportunity measure legacy effect intervention
To determine power study used estimate mean number one hemoglobin glucose split test based laboratory data
Given standard deviation power effect estimated practice included study
We expected dropout rate negligible
Possible reason drop retirement practice stopped using POCT equipment
The comparison outcome first intervention period estimate relative effectiveness ComRem versus GIA
The comparison second intervention period intervention switched group estimate relative effectiveness legacy effect ComRem direct effect ComRem
The comparison third period ComRem intervention discontinued group estimate relative effectiveness legacy effect ComRem legacy effect ComRem
Total number split test procedure corresponding POCT analysis performed practice period
In given month split test procedure performed practice conducted POCT analysis hemoglobin glucose
Thus maximum number possible split test procedure single analysis period four type analysis maximum number eight
A reminder sent type analysis missing
Therefore four month period study practice could received maximum four reminder
Whether required split test performed within given period
This defined high level procedural quality assessment guideline Laboratory
Whether split test procedure performed practice within given period
Data number POCT test conducted practice retrieved Capital administrative database information GPs reimbursement claim POCT test stored
Data number performed split test procedure retrieved Laboratory database
This dataset contain information immediately relatable specific patient split test performed artificial identification code
Data number reminder also obtained Laboratory
The Capital Region database provided information participating practice corresponding GPs

pertaining test difference Early ComRem Late ComRem Baseline period test difference Early ComRem Late ComRem beyond difference found baseline period three period
In first intervention period mean number split test performed group receiving ComRem group increased factor three baseline end first
In group targeted GIA primary outcome measure increased factor
Compared GIA without ComRem GIA plus ComRem significantly effective promoting adherence guideline number split test performed confidence interval p time higher Early ComRem group Late ComRem group beyond could expected difference group baseline
For secondary outcome pattern similar practice Early ComRem group performing least one recommended split test intervention baseline late ComRem group
In second intervention period intervention switched split test adherence group receiving ComRem increased level similar group received ComRem first intervention period
Also result practice received ComRem first period show significant legacy effect ComRem adherence close previous period
In third period ComRem intervention discontinued group effect ComRem decreased group adherence term primary outcome still significantly higher group compared baseline period
The result demonstrate significant effect computer reminder outcome measure
Furthermore development outcome measure various period study show strong legacy effect computer reminder
However computer reminder proved quite effective nudging practice towards higher degree adherence quality assessment guideline reminder ineffective regard minority practice
Thus respectively practice performing recommended split test group received ComRem intervention
The increase adherence quality standard observed late ComRem group first period study may ascribed general strengthening implementation activity previously mentioned
This study several methodological strength
First outcome measure highly valid independent subjective perception study population
Second selection bias study population avoided inclusion study based voluntary participation
Third dropout rate intervention period low
Furthermore setting ComRem seems feasible intervention easily converted permanent method supporting implementation external quality assessment
Thus reminder employed study constitute relatively simple technology compared advanced computerized decision support system
However technical infrastructure required sending automatically generated reminder straight GPs electronic patient journal obviously put certain limit immediate transferability intervention beyond particular setting
Also could argued solely measuring process adherence represents limitation mean know whether actual quality test improved along increased adherence procedural standard
This point another limitation namely quantitative data tell u specific action taken practice wish step adherence receive reminder going correct use testing equipment recalibrating equipment changing role responsibility practice
While Cochrane review focused reminder appearing computer screen patient encounter objective improving patient care process outcome many study centred prescription objective reminder study change provider behaviour regard managing laboratory test
Thus study deal behavioural adherence regard relatively simple procedure split testing likely effect ComRem reduced employed support implementation complex recommendation
Using electronic reminder support quality assurance new phenomenon Danish general practice
Hence certain may present study
It possible effect electronic reminder may decrease become widely used giving rise situation several different reminder compete attention health professional
It mentioned possible financial consequence stated reminder probably taken seriously doctor previously informed probably aware restriction payment yet applied response
While previous study reported small moderate effect computer reminder result study suggest electronic reminder quite effective tool changing professional behavior regard quality assurance medical equipment
Future research could explore electronic reminder perceived health professional whether perceived helpful disturbing concurrent operation different electronic reminder may affect effectiveness specific circumstance amplify reduce effectiveness electronic reminder
In term practical implication result study encouraged Laboratory make computer reminder part routine implementation move attests feasibility computer reminder setting
Furthermore continuation study Laboratory may attempt identify technical organizational change employed practice improved adherence intervention
Such knowledge could used assist practice adopting systematic approach quality assurance POCT
Finally general level noted increased technical possibility employing electronic reminder place responsibility policy maker quality assurance actor coordinate prioritize use electronic reminder order avoid overflow reminder clinic level
This study used blood sample retraceable specific patient order conduct split test
Patient identity kept hidden artificial identification code used practice

As outlined previous chapter simulation game increase student motivation science learning deepen understanding important science concept improve science process skill advance important learning goal
However rapid development simulation game science learning outpaced grounding theory research learning assessment
This chapter focus assessment learning outcome simulation game potential ass support student science learning
The first section us lens contemporary assessment theory identify weakness assessment student learning resulting interaction simulation game well weakness science assessment generally
The next section focus opportunity offered simulation enhanced assessment science learning
The third section discus similar opportunity enhanced assessment offered game
The fourth section describes social technical challenge using simulation game ass science learning research development needed address challenge
The final section present conclusion
The past two decade seen rapid advance cognitive measurement science increased awareness complementary strength understanding appraising student learning
National Research Council report conceptualized implication integration advance assessment form assessment This symbol represents critical idea assessment highly principled process reasoning evidence one attempt infer student know response carefully constructed selected set task performance
One corner triangle represents cognition theory data student learn second corner represents observation task student might perform demonstrate learning third corner represents interpretation method used draw inference observation
The study committee emphasized three element triangle must closely interrelated assessment valid informative
Mislevy et al
extended model framework known design ECD
This framework relates learning goal specified model student cognition evidence model specifying student response performance would represent desired learning outcome task model specific type question task designed elicit behavior performance identified evidence model Messick
The assessment triangle ECD framework used variety way including evaluation quality validity particular assessment used appraise student learning research instructional purpose guide design new assessment
Examples application described
Quellmalz Timms Schneider used ECD see framework evaluate assessment practice used recent research science simulation
The author reviewed article investigated use simulation grade included report measured learning outcome drawing study Scalise et al

The author found assessment included research student learning outcome rarely reflected integrated element framework
The study tended describe detail learning outcome targeted simulation student model task designed provide evidence related model task evidence model approach used interpret evidence reach conclusion student performance interpretation component assessment triangle
The lack attention desired learning outcome led lack alignment assessment task used capability simulation
Simulations often engage student science process virtual environment presenting interactive task yield rich stream data
Although data could provide evidence science process skill science learning goal difficult measure via conventional item test data rarely used assessment purpose
Instead study used paper pencil test measure one science learning understanding
The lack description desired learning goal task related goal made impossible evaluate depth conceptual understanding nature science process skill measured study simulation Quellmalz Timms Schneider
In addition limited description assessment item data item task quality made impossible evaluate technical quality assessment item validity drawing inference efficacy simulation enhance student learning
Finally study always describe assessment result could used researcher teacher potential user user group result might appropriate
When Quellmalz Timms Schneider applied ECD framework evaluate assessment student outcome recent study game concluded research effectively ass learning outcome playing game still infancy
As case simulation study often failed specify desired learning outcome assessment task item designed measure outcome
Furthermore game developer researcher rarely tapped capacity technology embed assessment learning game play
In education system driven standard external assessment simulation game unlikely widely used capacity advance science learning goal demonstrated via assessment result
Such result turn require alternate form evidence improved assessment method
At time improved assessment method draw capability simulation game measure important student learning outcome potential address major weakness current science assessment discussed
Most science assessment program operated state school district largely incapable measuring multiple science learning goal simulation game support
The state administer summative assessment measure student science achievement
These assessment reflect current state science standard frequently give greater weight conceptual understanding learning goal typically include long list science topic student expected master year Duschl National Research Council
Although science standard majority state also address science process understanding nature science always explicitly describe performance associated meeting learning goal making difficult align assessment element standard National Research Council

Although state school district use summative assessment evaluate overall level student science achievement teacher use formative assessment provide diagnostic A National Research Council committee currently developing framework new science standard focus smaller number big idea science
feedback instruction teaching learning adapted meet student need
In state school district different type level science assessment designed administered separately
Often well aligned linked closely curriculum instruction advance science learning goal specified state science standard
As result multiple form level assessment result yield conflicting incomplete information student science learning National Research Council
Despite repeated call improvement National Research Council science assessment slow change
Simulations game offer new possibility improvement assessment critical form knowledge skill deemed important target science learning National Research Council
As science learning assessment stand benefit tapping possibility offered simulation game

Students playing game take note navigate virtual world trying identify cause disease
Researchers scored note using rubric place student note one five category representing progressively higher level science content knowledge inquiry skill McQuiggan Robison Lester
For example student whose note included hypothesis problem performed better posttests content knowledge note placed higher category note include hypothesis
Although scoring process illuminated importance scaffolding student effort generate hypothesis
McQuiggan Robison Lester investigated whether machine learning technique could applied create measurement model use information student note successfully predict category judged human scorer
Their research indicates Bayes net method discussed could applied score student note real time
Application method would reduce cost scoring system provides evidence student conceptual understanding science process difficult measure using paper pencil test
These three example suggest researcher game developer making progress toward improved assessment student learning result game play activity well assessment within game play support better overall student learning
In proposal use assessment framework assessment design Shute et al

Nelson provides evidence carefully designed embedded assessment support development conceptual understanding
And work show potential carefully designed assessment method case scoring student note yield information inform design online learning environment support development science process skill
The work also show potential new measurement method draw inference student science learning pattern derived extensive data generated student interaction character context scenario found game McQuiggan Robison Lester
Another example current effort integrate learning assessment provided Cisco Networking Academy global education program teach student design build troubleshoot secure computer network
The academy online training curriculum us simulation game
Behrens note historically developer training curriculum created content loaded medium shell student navigate
The software architecture curriculum separate assessment system even though curriculum included embedded quiz simulation software Frezzo Behrens Mislevy press
More recently developer begun transfer performance data simulation activity curriculum business intelligence dashboard would help instructor student make sense large amount performance data generated student interaction simulation
Current research development aim make assessment ubiquitous unobtrusive element support learning digital learning environment
The cost new form assessment embedded simulation game could present challenge wider use
item like used current science test scored computer relatively inexpensive National Research Council
Tests incorporating item must scored human much expensive develop score Hamilton although progress made machine scoring complex test item
The state might able reduce cost new type assessment sharing assessment task design well data reporting infrastructure
The current development state assessment consortium response Department Education Race The Top initiative develop new generation assessment offer vehicle sharing cost type assessment including one designed used simulation gaming environment
Another challenge related role teacher
As mentioned previously teacher play important role supporting assessing learning simulation game
While assessment embedded simulation game provide timely useful information guide instruction extent teacher us information may strongly influence much learning take place
If assessment widely incorporated simulation game teacher professional development effort would needed support assist teacher making use new information individual student progress
Teachers could provided instruction practice related use simulation game teaching well aligned assessment purpose
At time developer would need consider make assessment information useful developer done creating online digital dashboard
The Cisco Networking Academy includes comprehensive assessment authoring interface allows instructor use assessment customize create assessment item
Perhaps important technical challenge embedding assessment simulation game make use rich stream data complex pattern generated learner interact technology reliably validly interpret learning
Simulations game engage learner complex task
As defined Williamson Bejar Mislevy complex task four characteristic Completion task requires student undergo multiple nontrivial step cognitive process
For example shown Figures student SimScientists assessment first observe simulated ecosystem noting behavior organism construct food web represent observation finally use population model tool vary number organism ecosystem observe outcome time
Multiple element feature task performance captured considered determine summative performance provide diagnostic feedback
Simulations game able capturing wide range student response action standard task short written response action like gathering quantitative evidence fish water sediment lake Squire Jan
There high degree potential variability type data provided task reflecting relatively unconstrained learning activity simulation game
For example simulation include measure time taken student perform task amount time spent necessarily reflect le effective performance
Without considered conjunction additional variable task performance time easy variable interpret
The measurement adequacy task solution requires task feature considered interdependent set rather conditionally independent
Simulations game mimic scenario thereby provide greater authenticity assessment turn would impact potential validity
At time however use complex task reduces number measure included one test thereby reducing reliability typically construed testing context
As illustrated four characteristic engaging student complex task yield diverse sequence student behavior performance
Assessment requires drawing inference real time student learning diverse behavior performance
However conventional psychometric theory method well suited modeling interpretation
To overcome limitation researcher pursuing variety application current method item response theory IRT also exploring new method better suited modeling assessment data derived complex task
Such new method accommodate uncertainty current state learner model pattern student behavior used provide basis immediate feedback task performance Quellmalz Timms Schneider
IRT one existing method often used conventional test show promise application assessment learning game simulation
IRT model place estimate student ability item difficulty linear scale difference student ability estimate item difficulty used interpret student performance
This method could useful determining much help student need solving problem intelligent learning environment measuring gap item difficulty current learner ability Timms
In study Stevens Beal Sprang used IRT analysis distinguish weaker stronger problem solver among chemistry student using problem set
The IRT analysis informed research author compared different learning strategy weaker stronger problem solver several different classroom tested intervention designed improve student problem solving
Researchers also applying testing machine learning method allow computer infer behavior pattern based large amount data generated student interaction simulation game
One promising method Bayes net also called Bayesian network
The use Bayes net assessment including assessment simulation game grown Martin VanLehn Mislevy Gitomer
For example Bayes net used score ecosystem benchmark assessment SimScientists Cisco Networking Academy staff used method ass examinee ability design troubleshoot computer network Behrens et
Another promising machine learning method Artificial Neural Network ANN
The detailed assessment quality student problem solving enabled ANN together technique Stevens Beal Sprang
In addition machine learning method developer sometimes use simpler method provide immediate assessment feedback response student action simulation game
method employ type logic decide interpret student action
A simple example would posing question distracters wrong answer choice derived known misconception content assessed
The student incorrect response revealing misconception could diagnosed logically immediate action could taken providing coaching

Wider use ECD framework would encourage researcher measurement specialist developer explicitly describe intended learning goal simulation game task item designed measure goal
This turn could support increased focus science process skill learning outcome often targeted simulation game rarely measured date strengthening field science assessment
Behrens caution without greater clarity intended learning outcome designer may add complex feature simulation game purpose
He suggests physical modeling game simulation need evolve simultaneously modeling motivation thinking learner
Perhaps greatest technical challenge embedding assessment learning simulation game lie drawing inference large amount data created student interaction learning environment

In addition assessment developed wide array group individual including teacher district administrator university private company state department education group include combination individual institution
While assessment take wide variety form education following description provide representative overview major form educational assessment
Assessments used wide variety purpose school Formative assessment commonly said learning educator use result modify improve teaching technique instructional period summative assessment said learning evaluate academic achievement conclusion instructional period
Or assessment expert Paul Black put When cook taste soup formative assessment
When customer taste soup summative Assessments also designed variety way different purpose The purpose assessment generally drive way designed many way assessment used
A standardized assessment assessment example form assessment standardized test
A portfolio student work used formative summative form assessment
assessment may also created team teacher commonly used single course grade level school assessment almost never Screening assessment may produced university conducted research specific area child development skill attribute student entering kindergarten increase likelihood successful pattern behavior strength challenge suggest child particular learning disability
In short assessment usually created highly specialized purpose
While educational assessment test around since day schoolhouse increasingly assumed central role effort improve effectiveness public school teaching
score example arguably dominant measure educational achievement United States also commonly reported indicator school teacher performance
As school become increasingly equipped computer tablet wireless internet access growing proportion assessment administered school either online test assessment still common widely used school
New technology software application also changing nature use assessment innumerable way given system typically offer array feature traditional test assignment
For example system may allow student log take assessment time may make performance result available student teacher immediately assessment completed historically might taken hour day week teacher review score grade assessment class
In addition digital online assessment typically include feature analytics give educator detailed information student performance
For example teacher may able see long took student answer particular question many time student failed answer question correctly getting right answer
Many advocate digital online assessment tend argue system used properly could help teacher many digital online system provide far detailed information academic performance student educator use information modify educational program instructional approach way address distinct learning need interest aspiration cultural background individual student
In addition many standardized test administered online though state typically allow student take test computer unavailable student prefer option student technological skill literacy required perform well online assessment
Given assessment come many form serve many diverse function thorough discussion purpose use assessment could fill lengthy book

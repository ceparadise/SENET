In consists recorded state working specific time generally program otherwise terminated abnormally
In practice key piece usually dumped time including may include program counter stack pointer memory management information processor operating system flag information
Core dump often used assist diagnosing error computer program
The name come principal form
The name remained long magnetic core technology became obsolete
On many operating system program automatically trigger core dump extension phrase dump core come mean many case fatal error regardless whether record program memory result
The term core dump memory dump dump also become jargon indicate storing large amount raw data examination purpose
Earliest core dump paper printout content memory typically arranged column number sometimes accompanied interpretation machine language instruction text string decimal number
As memory size increased analysis utility developed dump written magnetic medium like tape disk
Instead displaying content applicable memory modern operating system typically generate file containing image memory belonging crashed process memory image part related process along information value processor register program counter system flag information useful determining root cause crash
These file viewed text printed analysed specialised tool elfdump system Microsoft Windows Valgrind debugger
Modern core dump file error message typically use hexadecimal encoding decimal octal representation le convenient programmer
Core dump serve useful debugging aid several situation
On early standalone system core dump allowed user debug program without monopolizing expensive computing facility debugging printout could also convenient debugging using switch light
On shared computer whether batch processing server system core dump allow debugging system go back operation immediately
Core dump allow user save crash later analysis comparison crash
For may impractical support debugging computer analysis dump may take place different computer
Some operating system early version support attaching running process core dump necessary run debugger process memory content
Core dump used capture data freed may thus used retrieve information program longer running
In absence interactive debugger core dump may used assiduous programmer determine error direct examination
A core dump represents complete content dumped region address space dumped process
Depending operating system dump may contain data structure aid interpretation memory region
In system successful interpretation requires program user trying interpret dump understands structure program memory use
A debugger use one exists help programmer interpret dump identifying variable symbolically displaying source code symbol table available le interpretation dump possible might still enough possible determine cause problem
There also tool called analyze dump
One popular tool available many operating system GNU binutils
On modern operating system administrator programmer read core dump file using GNU Binutils BFD gdb objdump use library
This library supply raw data given address memory region core dump know anything variable data structure memory region application using library read core dump determine address variable determine layout data structure example using symbol table program undergoing debugging
Analysts crash dump system use Linux Kernel Crash Dump LKCD
Core dump save context state process given state returning later
Systems made highly available transferring core processor sometimes via core dump file
Core also dumped onto remote host network security risk
In older simpler operating system process contiguous core dump file simply binary file sequence byte word
In modern operating system process address space may gap share page process file elaborate representation used may also include information state program time dump
In system core dump generally use standard support two memory dump format described
There three type dump To analyze Windows dump used
memory dump also known memory dump single process
It contains selected data record full partial filtered process memory list state information kernel object list loaded unloaded
Full list option available enum
The probably first craft routinely utilize core dump feature Deep Space segment
The core dump feature mandatory telemetry feature Deep Space segment proven minimize system diagnostic cost
The Voyager craft us routine core dump spot memory damage event
Space Mission core dump system mostly based existing toolkits target CPU subsystem
However duration mission core dump subsystem may substantially modified enhanced specific need mission
Descriptions file format Kernel core dump

A core dump file computer documented memory program computer crashed
The file consists recorded status working memory explicit time usually close system crashed program ended atypically
Aside entire system memory part program aborted core dump file may include additional information Core dump may also known memory dump storage dump dump
Programmers often use core dump examine problem use debugger
A core dump include system memory part program failed
There several reason computer program crash Generally core dump file includes random access memory RAM content certain process part address space process value processor register
The core dump file used analyze cause dump viewed text printed
Because contemporary OS process address space may share break page file process intricate image used
In system core dump typically use standard executable image format Originally core dump transferred content memory precisely order record state computer
The core dump actual printout around hundred page consisted octal hexadecimal number
The page studied programmer research cause crash abnormally terminated program
Eventually introduction debugger eliminated need massive stack printout

Dump
This one word I heard among hardcore programmer hacker yet I never knew mean
I found almost everywhere center around software digital hardware
They say something like dumping file dump CPU dump memory
What feat usually performed
A data taken storage medium
unedited
For example content recorded state core specified time
In Unix software backup file system
In essence dump content taken storage medium contains state medium used mostly debugging purpose
In programming dump something mean get content
For example one say mean query content memory given address store somewhere analysis result called
In computing core dump properly memory dump storage dump consists recorded state working memory computer program specific time generally program terminated abnormally crashed
The name come day magnetic core memory used introduction semiconductor memory name remained established system inspired UNIX long technology faded use
In practice key piece
In large meaning represents state running program process medium storage

Sometimes I run code core dump file generated I terminate program
The file name form
The program terminating abruptly segmentation fault
I believe
If I try generated
Can anyone tell generated pressed
How I avoid core dump file generated
Is use core dumped file
A process dump core terminated operating system due fault program
The typical reason occurs program accessed invalid pointer value
Given sporadic dump likely using uninitialized pointer
Can post code causing fault
Other vague generalization hard guess wrong without actually seeing code
As core dump actually check Wikipedia article As said others core dump result fault program
You configure core dump generated command
Entering disables core file generation active shell
If program generated core built symbol information like Core dump generated process receives certain signal SIGSEGV kernel sends access memory outside address space
Typically happens error pointer used
That mean bug program
The core dump useful finding bug
It image process memory time problem debugger gdb used see program
The debugger even access sometimes value variable program
You prevent core dump happening using ulimit command
It tool aid debugging application behaving badly
It large contains content application physical memory time died well register state stack thread
They get generated kernel kill application something evil like generating segmentation violation bus error
sends signal SIGQUIT process
According standard default action signal generate core
SIGILL SIGABRT SIGFPE SIGSEGV case system generate core
Please refer man signal system detail
You avoid creating core dump file writing code crash Seriously core dump useful see state program crashed post mortem debugging
You open gdb inspect state program especially built debugging
Core dump usually get made program SIGSEGV usually caused invalid pointer dereferencing SIGABRT would happen called abort default terminate handler exception destructors etc fault
You also trigger explicitly debugger programmatically
If fixed bug perfect delete
Also changed program way recompiled become useless debug info wo match core dump delete
The point generate core dump
That
If want generated use instead
If program question responding need kill terminal either developer something wrong
Programs designed killed terminal still respond gracefully triggered another terminal via
If else fails force immediate termination

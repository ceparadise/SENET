In association name entity region binding valid name used refer entity
Such region referred
In part program name may refer different entity may different binding nothing may unbound
The scope binding also known entity particularly older technical literature perspective referenced entity referencing name
A scope part program scope set binding precise tricky casual use practice largely corresponds function file depending language type entity
The term scope also used refer set entity visible name valid within portion program given point program correctly referred
Strictly speaking practice programming language part program refers portion source code area text known
In language however part program refers portion run time time period execution known
Both term somewhat misleading misuse technical term discussed distinction accurate precise standard respective term
Lexical scope main focus article dynamic scope understood contrast lexical scope
In case name resolution based lexical scope straightforward use implement use one simply read backwards source code determine entity name refers implementation one simply maintain list name context compiling interpreting program
Basic difficulty arise considerably subtler one arise particularly
The strict definition lexical scope name unambiguous portion source code binding name entity applies virtually unchanged definition specification
Representative language specification follow
Most commonly scope refers given name refer given effect also apply entity function type class constant enumeration
A fundamental distinction scoping part program mean
In language also called name resolution depends location source code defined named variable function defined
In contrast language name resolution depends upon name encountered determined
In practice lexical scope variable definition resolved searching containing block function fails searching outer containing block whereas dynamic scope calling function searched function called calling function progressing call stack
Of course rule first look local definition variable
Most modern language use lexical scoping variable function though dynamic scoping used language notably dialect Lisp scripting language like
Even lexically scoped language scope confusing uninitiated depend lexical context closure defined called
Lexical resolution determined also known dynamic resolution general determined thus known
In selects object runtime though whether actual name binding done compile time run time depends language
De facto dynamic scoping common directly name resolution instead expand place
Some programming framework like use term scope mean something entirely different used article
In framework scope object programming language use case AngularJS used certain way framework emulate dynamic scope language us lexical scope variable
Those scope scope using usual meaning term given part program following usual rule variable scope language like object using rule
In context AngularJS sometimes term scope dollar sign used avoid confusion using dollar sign variable name often discouraged style guide
Scope important component turn fundamental
Name resolution including scope varies programming language within programming language varies type entity rule scope called
Together scoping rule crucial change one part program break unrelated part
When discussing scope three basic concept Scope context particular frequently confused scope property identifier fixed context property program varies position
More precisely context property position program either position source code point
Execution context consists lexical context current execution point plus additional runtime state
Thus execution point program variable name scope variable name context meaning context point execution point exit variable name scope returning function variable name go context
Narrowly speaking execution program enters exit various scope point execution identifier context context hence identifier come context go context program enters exit scope however practice usage much looser
Scope level concept property identifier particularly variable function name identifier source code entity program part behavior compiler interpreter language
As issue scope similar type reference used program generally
Using value variable name context variable uninitialized analogous dereferencing accessing value undefined
However variable destroyed go context analog exist
For entity variable scope subset also known name refer variable exists possibly undefined value variable exist necessarily visible variable may exist inaccessible value stored referred within given context accessible via given name case program scope name
In case lifetime irrelevant label named position source code lifetime identical program statically compiled language may context given point program likewise context entire program context within function local context lifetime entire run program
Determining entity identifier refers known particularly varies language
Given identifier language properly compiler interpreter check entity context match case ambiguity two entity name global local variable name name resolution rule used distinguish
Most frequently name resolution relies rule Python LEGB Local Enclosing Global rule name implicitly resolve narrowest relevant context
In case name resolution explicitly specified keywords Python case default rule overridden
When two identical identifier context time referring different entity one say occurring name usually innermost masking name
At level variable known
Due potential masking language disallow discourage masking raising error warning compile time run time
Various various different scoping rule different kind declaration identifier
Such scoping rule large effect consequently behavior correctness program
In language like accessing unbound variable semantics may result similar referring declaration identifier used outside scope generate
Scopes frequently tied language construct determined implicitly many language also offer construct specifically controlling scope
Scope vary little single expression much entire program many possible gradation
The simplest scoping rule global scope entity visible throughout entire program
The basic modular scoping rule scoping global scope anywhere program local scope within function
More sophisticated modular programming allows separate module scope name visible within module private module visible outside
Within function language C allow block scope restrict scope subset function others notably functional language allow expression scope restrict scope single expression
Other scope include file scope notably C function similarly module scope block scope outside function notably Perl
A subtle issue exactly scope begin end
In language C scope start declaration thus different name declared within given block different scope
This requires declaring function use though necessarily defining requires case notably mutual recursion
In language JavaScript Python name scope begin start relevant block start function regardless defined name within given block scope JavaScript known
However name bound value varies behavior name undefined value differs Python use undefined variable yield runtime error JavaScript undefined variable usable undefined value function declaration also hoisted top containing function usable throughout function
Many language especially language offer feature called allow declaration scope single expression
This convenient example intermediate value needed computation
For example return expression evaluates using temporary variable named avoid calling twice
Some language block scope approximate functionality offering syntax block embedded expression example aforementioned Standard ML expression could written
In Python auxiliary variable generator expression list comprehension Python expression scope
In C variable name expression scope known context
As variable name prototype referred may different actual definition dummy often omitted though may used generating documentation instance
Many programming language allow scope restricted known
This began e declaration valid block
today particularly associated language family tradition
Most often block contained within function thus restricting scope part function case Perl block may within function
A representative example use block scope C code shown two variable scoped loop loop variable initialized incremented iteration loop auxiliary variable initialized iteration
The purpose avoid adding variable function scope relevant particular block example prevents error generic loop variable accidentally already set another value
In example expression would generally assigned auxiliary variable body loop would simply written complicated example auxiliary variable useful
Blocks primarily used control flow loop case block scope mean scope variable depends structure function flow execution
However language block scope typically also allow use naked block whose sole purpose allow control variable scope
For example auxiliary variable may defined block used say added variable function scope discarded block end loop might enclosed block initializes variable used inside loop initialized
A subtlety several programming language C demonstrated example standardized since variable declared within body block also within control statement
This analogous function parameter declared function declaration block function body start scope whole function body
This primarily used initialization statement separate loop condition unlike loop common idiom
Block scope used shadowing
In example inside block auxiliary variable could also called shadowing parameter name considered poor style due potential error
Furthermore descendant C Java C despite support block scope local variable made go scope end function allow one local variable hide another
In language attempted declaration second would result syntax error one variable would renamed
If block used set value variable block scope requires variable declared outside block
This complicates use conditional statement
For example Python use block scope one may initialize variable accessible statement
In Perl block scope instead requires declaring variable prior block Often instead rewritten using multiple assignment initializing variable default value
In Python necessary would Perl would In case single variable assignment alternative use avoid block general possible multiple variable assignment difficult read complex logic
This significant issue C notably string assignment string initialization automatically allocate memory string assignment already initialized variable requires allocating memory string copy checking successful
Some language allow concept block scope applied varying extent outside function
For example Perl snippet right variable name block scope due use keyword function name global scope
Each call increase value one return new value
Code outside block call otherwise obtain alter value
This idiom allows one define Perl
Most commonly used programming language offer way create function variable whose scope end go context function return
In case lifetime variable duration function call created function start variable declared destroyed function return scope variable within function though meaning within depends whether scoping lexical dynamic
However language C also provide lifetime variable entire lifetime program variable context inside function
In case static local variable variable created program initializes destroyed program terminates context within function like automatic local variable
Importantly lexical scoping variable function scope scope within function move context another function called within function move back context function return called function access local variable calling function local variable context within body function declared
By contrast dynamic scoping scope extends function local variable another function called moving context defining function end thus local variable context function defined
In language lexical scoping local variable context nested function since within lexical context function lexically nested
A local variable enclosing function known nested function
Function scope also applicable
For example snippet Python code right two function defined
computes square number computes sum square number
For example
Each function variable named represents argument function
These two variable completely separate unrelated despite name lexically scoped local variable function scope one scope lexically separate function thus overlap
Therefore call without altered
Similarly variable named variable limited scope interfere variable named might belong function
In word risk identifier unrelated identifier even identical
Note also name masking occurring one variable named context given time scope overlap
By contrast similar fragment written language dynamic scope calling function would remain context called function scope would overlap would masked shadowed new called function
Function scope significantly complicated function object created locally function returned
In case variable nested function local unbound variable function definition resolve variable enclosing context create function also environment variable must returned potentially called different context
This requires significantly support compiler complicate program analysis
A scoping rule largely particular C scope variable function declared top level file within function entire file rather C declaration end source file precisely internal linking
This seen form module scope module identified file modern language replaced explicit module scope
Due presence include statement add variable function internal context may call include statement difficult determine context body file
In C code snippet function name file scope
In scope name entire module however may structured across various file
In paradigm module basic unit complex program allow information hiding exposing limited interface
Module scope pioneered family language Python influenced Modula representative contemporary example
In language lack direct support module similar structure instead provided class hierarchy class basic unit program class private method
This properly understood context rather name resolution scope though often play analogous role
In case facility available Python module class code organization function conventionally private method choice programmer
A declaration effect throughout entire program
Variable name global scope called frequently considered bad practice least language due possibility name collision unintentional masking together poor modularity function scope block scope considered preferable
However global scope typically used depending language various sort identifier name function name
In case mechanism used avoid collision
The use local variable variable name limited scope exist within specific function help avoid risk name collision two identically named variable
However two different approach answering question What mean within function
In also called variable name scope certain function scope program text function definition within text variable name exists bound variable value outside text variable name exist
By contrast variable name scope certain function scope function executing function running variable name exists bound value function return variable name exist
This mean function invokes separately defined function lexical scoping function access local variable assuming text inside text dynamic scoping function access local variable since invoked invocation
Consider example program right
The first line creates global variable initializes
The second line defines function print echo current value set overwriting previous value
The third line defines function creates local variable hiding identically named global variable initializes call
The fourth line call
The fifth line print current value
So exactly program print
It depends scoping rule
If language program one us lexical scoping print modifies global variable defined outside program print
By contrast language us dynamic scoping print modifies local variable called within program print
As happens language program us dynamic scoping program print
With name always refers le local lexical environment
This property program text made independent runtime language implementation
Because matching requires analysis static program text type scoping also called
Lexical scoping standard language well modern functional language
It also used syntactic semantic relative although different kind limitation
Static scoping allows programmer reason object reference parameter variable constant type function etc
simple name substitution
This make much easier make modular code reason since local naming structure understood isolation
In contrast dynamic scope force programmer anticipate possible dynamic context module code may invoked
For example consider Pascal program fragment right
The variable visible point never hidden another variable name
The variable visible main program hidden variable visible procedure
Variable also visible procedure hide variable
Variable visible procedure therefore accessible either procedure main program
Also procedure visible procedure therefore called main program
There could another procedure declared program outside procedure
The place program mentioned determines two procedure named represents thus precisely analogous scope variable
Correct implementation static scope language trivial requires function value carry record value variable depends pair function environment called
Depending implementation variable become slightly inefficient deeply lexically function used although technique mitigate
Also nested function refer argument immediately local variable relative location known
No overhead therefore incurred using type nested function
The applies particular part program nested function used naturally program written language nested function available C language
Lexical scoping used picked language since
approximates static lexical scoping introduced LISP via device developed working
The original Lisp interpreter early used dynamic scoping descendant dynamically scoped language often adopt static scoping SRFI dynamic static scoping
another language dynamic scoping added static scoping afterwards
Languages like always lexical scoping since influenced idea went although C include lexically
The term lexical scope date least term lexical scoping date least used describe scoping rule Lisp dialect known Muddle
With global identifier refers identifier associated recent environment uncommon modern language
In technical term mean identifier global binding
Introducing local variable name push binding onto global stack may empty popped leaf scope
Evaluating context always yield top binding
Note done binding stack exists type scoping called scoping
Generally certain defined create binding whose lifetime execution time block add feature static scoping dynamic scoping process
However since section code called many different location situation difficult determine outset binding apply variable used one exists
This beneficial application suggests code avoid depending circumstance variable value simply use value according variable definition
This narrow interpretation shared data provide flexible system adapting behavior function current state policy system
However benefit relies careful documentation variable used way well careful avoidance assumption variable behavior provide mechanism detect interference different part program
Dynamic scoping also void benefit
As dynamic scoping dangerous modern language use
Some language like allow programmer choose static dynamic scoping defining redefining variable
Examples language use dynamic scoping include shell language
Dynamic scoping fairly easy implement
To find identifier value program could traverse runtime stack checking activation record function stack frame value identifier
In practice made efficient via use stack pair
Pairs pushed onto stack whenever declaration made popped whenever variable go scope
alternative strategy considerably faster making use associate name stack meaning
This avoids linear search find particular name care taken properly maintain table
Note strategy assume ordering binding one variable practice binding ordered
An even simpler implementation representation dynamic variable simple global variable
The local binding performed saving original value anonymous location stack invisible program
When binding scope terminates original value restored location
In fact dynamic scope originated manner
Early implementation Lisp used obvious strategy implementing local variable practice survives dialect still use GNU Emacs Lisp
Lexical scope introduced Lisp later
This equivalent shallow binding scheme except central reference table simply global variable binding environment current meaning variable global value
Maintaining global variable complex
For instance symbol object dedicated slot global value
Dynamic scoping provides excellent abstraction used way based saving restoring global variable
A possible implementation strategy variable key
When variable accessed key used access memory location code generated compiler know variable dynamic lexical
If key exist calling thread global location used
When variable locally bound prior value stored hidden location stack
The storage created variable key new value stored
Further nested override variable within thread simply save restore location
When initial override scope terminates key deleted exposing global version variable thread
In modern language key example de facto dynamic scope
The macro language transforms source code without resolving name since expansion done place name expanded text resolved notably free variable resolved based expanded loosely called dynamic scoping occurring
The used de facto dynamic scope name resolution
For example macro expand add passed variable identifier later resolved compiler based macro called properly expanded dynamic scope independent macro defined
Properly C preprocessor expanding macro tokenization stage parsing syntax tree name resolution
For example following code macro resolved expansion local variable expansion site As seen one key reason scope help prevent name collision allowing identical identifier refer distinct thing restriction identifier must separate scope
Sometimes restriction inconvenient many different thing need accessible throughout program generally need identifier global scope different technique required avoid name collision
To address many language offer mechanism organizing global identifier
The detail mechanism term used depend language general idea group identifier given name prefix necessary entity referred consisting identifier plus prefix
Normally identifier sense two set scope scope usually global scope qualified identifier visible one narrower scope without prefix visible well
And normally group organized group
Although many language support concept detail vary greatly
Some language mechanism serve almost exclusively enable global identifier organized group
Other language mechanism combine additional purpose allowing identifier visible member group
And language often allow class singleton object fulfill purpose whether mechanism primary purpose
Furthermore language often meld approach example package largely similar namespaces optionally double class programming organizes variable function class organizes class package
Scoping rule representative language follow
In C scope traditionally known particularly variable
C lexically scoped language global scope known form module scope file scope known local scope within function within function scope nested via block scope
However standard C support nested function
The lifetime visibility variable determined
There three type lifetime C static program execution automatic block execution allocated stack manual allocated heap
Only static automatic supported variable handled compiler manually allocated memory must tracked manually across different variable
There three level visibility C external linkage global internal linkage roughly file block scope includes function block scope nested different level internal linkage possible use includes
Internal linkage C visibility level namely source file processed notably including relevant includes
C program compiled separate linked executable library via
Thus name resolution split across compiler resolve name within translation unit loosely compilation unit properly different concept linker resolve name across translation unit see discussion
In C variable block scope enter scope declared top block move scope function called within block move back scope function return move scope end block
In case automatic local variable also allocated declaration deallocated end block static local variable allocated program initialization deallocated program termination
The following program demonstrates variable block scope coming scope partway block exiting scope fact deallocated block end The program output There level scope Variable name used function prototype function prototype visibility exit scope end function prototype
Since name used useful compilation may useful documentation
Label name GOTO statement function scope case label name block scope block switch
All variable intend use program must declared type specifier earlier point code like previous code beginning body function main declared b result type int
A variable either global local scope
A global variable variable declared main body source code outside function local variable one declared within body function block
Modern version nested lexical scoping
lexically scoped using block
lexically scoped
A Java class contain three type variable defined inside method particular block
These variable local defined lower level
For example loop inside method use method local variable way around
The loop variable local loop destroyed soon loop end
also called variable declared within class outside method
By default variable available method within class also class package
variable method declaration
In general set bracket defines particular scope variable top level within class differ behavior depending modifier keywords used definition
The following table show access member permitted modifier
simple variable initialization name resolution rule cause problem widespread use closure callback mean lexical environment function defined used name resolution different lexical environment called irrelevant name resolution
JavaScript object name resolution property separate topic
JavaScript lexical scoping nested function level global scope outermost scope
This scoping used variable function meaning function declaration opposed variable function type
Block scoping keywords standard since
Block scoping produced wrapping entire block function executing known IIFE pattern
While JavaScript scoping simple lexical associated initialization name resolution rule cause confusion
Firstly assignment name scope default creating new global variable local one
Secondly create new local variable one must use keyword variable created top function value variable assigned value assignment expression reached This known declaration initialization hoisted top function
Thirdly accessing variable initialization yield rather syntax error
Fourthly function declaration declaration initialization hoisted top function unlike variable initialization
For example following code produce dialog output local variable declaration hoisted shadowing global variable initialization variable undefined used Further function object JavaScript frequently assigned callback returned function function executed name resolution depends originally defined lexical environment definition lexical environment execution environment called
The nested scope particular function global local JavaScript particularly closure used callback sometimes referred analogy prototype chain object
produced JavaScript using nested function function object
Returning nested function enclosing function includes local variable enclosing function lexical environment returned function yielding closure
For example Closures frequently used JavaScript due used callback
Indeed hooking function local environment callback returning function creates closure unbound variable function body environment closure based nested scope current lexical environment scope chain may accidental
When creating callback based parameter parameter must stored closure otherwise accidentally create closure refers variable enclosing environment may change
Name resolution property JavaScript object based inheritance prototype tree path root tree called separate name resolution variable function
dialect various rule scoping
The original Lisp used dynamic scoping introduced static lexical scoping Lisp family
adopted lexical scoping Scheme dialect Lisp like still use dynamic scoping
For variable Python function scope module scope global scope
Names enter scope start context function module globally exit scope function called context end
If name used prior variable initialization raise runtime exception
If variable simply accessed assigned context name resolution follows LEGB rule Local Enclosing Global
However variable assigned default creating local variable scope entire context
Both rule overridden Python declaration prior use allows accessing global variable even intervening nonlocal variable assigning global nonlocal variable
As simple example function resolve variable global scope Note initialized called error raised even though declared declared
Lexically allowed Python
Here assignment creates new local variable change value global variable Assignment variable within function cause declared local function hence local variable scope entire function thus using prior assignment raise error
This differs C local variable scope declaration entire function
This code raise error The default name resolution rule overridden Python keywords
In code declaration mean resolve global variable
It thus accessed already initialized assignment assigns global variable rather declaring new local variable
Note declaration needed since assign variable default resolving global variable
also used nested function
In addition allowing assignment global variable unnested function also used access global variable presence nonlocal variable For nested function also declaration assigning nonlocal variable similar using unnested function lexically scoped language unlike implementation value free variable determined set global variable R determined environment function created
The scoping environment may accessed using variety feature simulate experience dynamic scoping programmer desire

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
While teaching OOP high school CS major java important part curriculum case explain A question voiced many student
The usual explanation technical one As student know inheritance explanation accessed thing inheritance tree really get idea
Examples show far work number student
So got thinking How access level explained intuitive way high school student
Note I asking main problem explaining access level
I talking access modifier object method class Here analogy I used several year student seem understand
It focus rule public private protected
Most know I live beach
If find riding past house hot outside might come front door knock ask could soda
I live gated community anyone come front door knock
My front door public
However ca open front door walk right kitchen open refrigerator door help soda
My refrigerator door public
My child grandchild however live next door think nothing walking house getting anything like refrigerator
In house refrigerator protected family directly access general public
Not everything family protected though
My kid know going upstairs finding Visa card charging new book Amazon permitted
My Visa card content wallet private
No one else access directly make request
What teacher used following example pretty simple people understood
Your father order pizza
The delivery guy arrives expects payment
The containing money belongs object If wallet get father open pay
If wallet go pay pizza guy
If wallet pizza guy take pay Ooh one favorite lesson
I introduce lesson principle I want absorb ultimately motivate entire system
My lesson introduces idea permission really I get started Ojects key idea encapsulation also lie therein
The lesson work roughly like Students default wanting everything I provide motivating example bad idea
The entire set step rather long I create setup give broad outline I proceed
First projector I create point object I next create class I put
I create point show use direct access public variable
At point basically created struct
When come time print point I create Then I create rectangle class right I stop ask class create two point
This I get
Which lead question directly set actual value two point object
Given principle I yet justified opt object
So continue go back create constructor
My next stop finish constructor We almost ready blow everything
I go back create At point get obvious question Looking principle discover though fault probably like real responsibility lie
This immediately motivates series cascading change In discussion get This prevents trouble help Objects guarantee part Principle
And finally I bring What follows series short task I tell sketch series theoretical private instance variable appropriate getters setter
After one put student answer I let kid projector
This give u chance practice three principle together really drive point home
I give lesson high mark historically squelching instance variable created unfiltered getters setter variable
Instead I found student generate much thoughtful object design
I like draw class box within describe inheritance ignoring multiple inheritance
So inherit I box labeled containing box box
Inside box I section Public method private method protected method I wo talk answer
Then using box drawing I could indicate public method get box made publicly available whereas private method ca get box
This idea could also expressed tree structure In case public method change level tree either direction private method exit level move different class level
This part clearer box
The fact OO language support public private method data member crucial important design choice
And get full deep understanding OO programming work crucial understand work want use another way explaining language
Many analogy answer far help student learn work I wonder whether break point explaining make something public private therefore
Part problem often teach class The problem class given getters setter simply provide direct access reading writing primitive value difficult argue add value
To come justification name idNum private use argument convincing
It becomes easier see abstract data type Dictionary key value allows insertion deletion implemented internally many different way linked list hash table balanced lookup tree
You show keeping detail internal state private possible swap different implementation without needing change code us data structure
But course much sophisticated example
It requires understanding headed road student typically equipped understand teacher position explain student encounter Java first programming language
It reason I sit Java excellent choice second third language student already done enough programming appreciate need data abstraction information hiding tried write fairly complex program without tool
It however poor choice language teach first requires student accept faith many principle OOP motivation reason background understand yet
I fully aware iconoclastic point view fighting word many OOP true believer
I fully prepared backlash
Unfortunately question depends language
I give general discussion focus Java
public say visible code program original java concept meant visible across globe found computer could anyway theory
private mean visible anywhere class java b visible specific object
Object level private interesting idea often implemented
Usually private mean class level
In java giving indication blank mean visible anywhere package mean something code one package another
In scala blank mean public
BTW package
protected mean visible throughout package AND ALSO visible subclass class defined outside package
This dangerous use since broader blank
It useful library code however
I know I really give intuitive answer
For beginner visibility really public private
Protected library primarily I think blank way build buggy code since visibility across various class likely get trouble
So Public like library Protected like book shelf team workspace Private like bookshelf home
Note also purpose visibility intention language designer restrict programmer reference code code reference code
It intended facilitate team working different part large application permitting work namespace say class package work programmer impede progress
Negotiation need occur boundary every name everywhere say million line program
Generally single programmer pair given time responsible class
A small team perhaps package
I distinct memory college CS teacher saying friend touch
The context yes accompanying eyebrow waggle
The meaning pretty clear I still remember year
Of course may tone high school analogy one private could useful
Unless honor programming class access modifier may difficult understand
I usually start provide simple case
For example usually bad idea make instance variable Instead make private provide public accessor method I use phone number
You know cell phone number I
That make private instance variable
I way get without telling
If public instance variable instead knowing would tattooed forehead
Then creepy guy want ask see hall look forehead get number put phone
Congrats stalker
But want give phone number people long control get
For need keep instance variable private make public getter accessor method like getPhoneNumber
Now whatever want decide want share phone number guy hall
Is creepy
Does nice friend
Is missing teeth
Does drive nice car
It decide
And backtrack bit
Tattooed forehead little simplified
If truly public anyone could change
It like written washable Crayola marker
Works hook need accessors modifier
I teach mainly high school two modifier I really worry
We brush protected get little deeper inheritance point got public private pretty well short hop
I think good way looking like legislation United state
Public would national law impact everyone country
Private like state city level law much smaller scope
Now legislation fit protected category ex post facto fact Latin
If something legal later becomes illegal get charged previous action
One charged crime committed legislation passed
An example PUBLIC protected National level Pot completely illegal
PRIVATE protected Colorado Pot legal medicinal recreative use

In storage location identified paired associated contains known unknown quantity information referred
The variable name usual way stored value addition referring variable depending context
This separation name content allows name used independently exact information represents
The identifier computer value variable may thus change course
Variables programming may directly correspond concept
The latter reference physical object storage location
The value computing variable necessarily part mathematics
Variables computer programming frequently given long name make relatively descriptive use whereas variable mathematics often terse name brevity transcription manipulation
A variable storage location may referred several different identifier situation known
Assigning value variable using one identifier change value accessed identifier
replace variable symbolic name actual location data
While variable name type location often remain fixed data stored location may changed program execution
In value generally time
In variable expression keep single value entire due requirement
In imperative language behavior exhibited named symbolic constant typically contrasted normal variable
Depending programming language variable may able store specified

Alternatively datatype may associated current value allowing single variable store anything supported programming language
An identifier referencing variable used access variable order read value alter value edit variable access permission etc
For instance variable might referenced identifier variable contain number
If variable referenced identifier well using identifier value variable altered reading value using identifier yield result
If variable referenced single identifier simply called
Otherwise speak
For instance previous example name variable question another name variable
The variable describes program text variable may used describes program execution variable meaningful value
The scope variable actually property name variable extent property variable
These confused also called property program varies point source code execution see
Further may coincide variable lifetime many case tied variable lifetime
A variable name affect
important part variable
Most language define specific variable well named entity may differ within given program
The scope variable portion program code variable name meaning variable said visible
Entrance scope typically begin variable lifetime come context exit scope typically end lifetime go context
For instance variable meaningful within certain finely within block accordingly static resolution performable
Alternatively variable resolved based global binding stack depends specific control flow
Variables accessible within certain function termed
A one indefinite scope may referred anywhere program
hand runtime aspect variable
Each variable value runtime
The extent binding portion program execution time variable continues refer value memory location
A running program may enter leave given extent many time case
Unless programming language feature variable whose extent permanently outlasts scope result whereby memory allocated variable never freed since variable would used reference deallocation purpose longer accessible
However permissible variable binding extend beyond scope occurs Lisp C execution pass back variable scope variable may used
A variable whose scope begin extent said often undefined arbitrary value accessed see since yet explicitly given particular value
A variable whose extent end scope may become deemed uninitialized since value destroyed
Variables described previous two case may said
In many language error try use value variable extent
In language may yield
Such variable may however assigned new value give new extent
For space efficiency memory space needed variable may allocated variable first used freed longer needed
A variable needed scope thus beginning variable lifetime enters scope may give space unused variable
To avoid wasting space compiler often warn programmer variable declared used
It considered good programming practice make scope variable narrow feasible different part program accidentally interact modifying variable
Doing also prevents
Common technique different section program use different make individual variable private either
Many programming language employ reserved value often named indicate invalid uninitialized variable
In language variable also meaning certain kind value stored
For example variable type prohibited storing text value
In language value variable carry type
In situation exist simultaneously A variable given type undeclared assumed universal exists compile time
Values also type checked queried runtime
Typing variable also allows resolved compile time
However different polymorphism used function call referred resolve call based value type opposed supertypes variable allowed
Variables often store simple data like integer literal string programming language allow variable store value well
Such language may also enable function
These function operate like variable represent data multiple type
For example function named may determine length list
Such function may parametric polymorphic including type variable since amount element list independent element type
The function also referred variable
For instance code segment variable named given value function called
The integer give value
In language function parameter local scope
This specific variable named referred within function though course function also variable called
The specific variable allocation representation value vary widely among programming language among implementation given language
Many language implementation allocate space whose extent last single function call whose memory automatically reclaimed function return
More generally name variable bound address particular block contiguous sequence byte memory operation variable manipulate block
common variable whose value large unknown size code compiled
Such variable reference location value instead storing value allocated pool memory called
Bound variable value
A value however abstraction idea implementation value represented stored somewhere computer memory
The program must set aside memory data object since memory finite ensure memory yielded reuse object longer needed represent variable value
Objects allocated heap must object longer needed
In language runtime environment automatically reclaims object extant variable longer refer
In language program programmer must explicitly memory later free reclaim memory
Failure lead heap depleted program run risk eventual failure exhausting available memory
When variable refers created dynamically component may indirectly accessed variable
In circumstance garbage collector analogous program feature language lack garbage collector must deal case portion memory reachable variable need reclaimed
Unlike mathematical counterpart programming variable constant commonly take name

name commonly used auxiliary variable instance variable
Some naming convention enforced language level part language syntax involve format valid identifier
In almost language variable name start digit contain whitespace character
Whether punctuation mark permitted variable name varies language language many language permit variable name forbid punctuation
In programming language specific often punctuation character known prefixed appended variable identifier indicate variable type
variable name also varies language language require use certain case naming certain entity Most modern language older language
Some language reserve certain form variable name internal use many language name beginning two underscore often fall category
However beyond basic restriction imposed language naming variable largely matter style
At level variable name used exact name chosen matter computer
Thus name variable identify rest tool programmer make program easier write understand
Using poorly chosen variable name make code difficult review name name clear often encouraged
Programmers often create adhere code style guideline offer guidance naming variable impose precise naming scheme
Shorter name faster type le descriptive longer name often make program easier read purpose variable easier understand
However extreme verbosity variable name also lead le comprehensible code

We got neck tattoo guy
He obviously got hired I heard people department regularly interact refer I neck tattoo guy
It impact good manager
A bad manager likely use anything else
Would hire guy tattoo covering face scalp
To clarify position I pretty much line care long covered
I expect covered time certain situation presenting tattoo bad given people
I sorry I walk room candidate visible tattoo yeah bit much
However sleeve provided tasteful like THE JEWS something really care
If otherwise qualified
Absolutely
The way person look impact ability job
Yes
On sheer technical level affect ability job however person responsible meeting client giving meeting
I expect person look professional situation I think face tattoo thing like big gauge ear professional
giving meeting So think somebody ca lead meeting tattoo face
That absolutely ridiculous
Would hire ugly person face would distracting meeting
Sorry nitpicking one thing said taking context
Software developer rarely deal customer regard really matter professional took
But talk meeting ARE representing company
If ca look professional rare scenario representing company issue
No one talking attractive ugly someone talking professional someone needed
If dress really casually asked lead meeting wear dress shirt day
You ca tattoo face
Sleeves tattoo hidden time needed hence specifically said face scalp tattoo
And ugly unprofessional
The fact made connection odd
What mean professional
The term hijacked allow people justify prejudice
Someone effective worker communicates well solve hard problem professional
I see face tattoo would change
They either performing work
So definition someone come wearing dirty clothes reeking bathed professional provided job
I would include reasonably disgusting term
However I would go far say anyone tattoo definition unprofessional
So agree personal appearance factor whether someone professional
So make using term people well groomed better people face tattoo
Well interesting strawman
I would hire someone could convey professional image
For instance insisted coming interview dirty clothes talking random recent stain might gotten day obviously bathe extremely disheveled
Attractiveness nothing
If anything close negative skull snake I negative first impression
This one hit home little bit
For worth month ago I got skull tattooed elbow snake coming mouth
The snake modified piece whole basically something I got confront weird preoccupation mortality rather unsettling idea I slowly surely marching toward certain demise mind since I likely far young worrying thing like adult life basically manifested strong desire make kind meaningful contribution outlast
I look work best shot tried push career toward picking skill opportunity would get closer able make mark
So yeah kind gross I skull elbow
But I hungry good work
You skull body right negative
Snakes important part natural food chain overall cool animal negative
Skulls snake thing people think cool like tattoo
No different frog butterfly
Certainly level gang tat
You judging person bad based image liked well enough inked skin assigning meaning something may none beyond I thought looked cool
When see someone butterfly flower tattoo think probably entomolygists botanist wonder trying get software job
ITT Tattoos bad people think bad therefore bad
What lot people get professional culture come style choice
It anymore
If distracted someone tattoo focus technical detail hand maybe one unprofessional
Same go graphic tee cargo short anything else often called unprofessional
IMHO describes kind paradise fit human nature
I remember reading study recently people wearing formal clothing likely abstract thought
And course someone tattoo bloody eyeball emerging vagina forehead going distracting
Appearance unfortunately matter
depends kind company work
youre working tech company outside bible belt area usually seen factor
course always going random place wouldnt even hire saw tattoo hopefully interviewed long sleeve wear long sleeve working place like
around though little extra prove tattoo matter company work theyre quickly forgotten
I say someone sleeve work hiring manger one big tech company
Are implying would problem bible belt
honestly im stereotyping I think would
It
Stereotypes damaging offensive
My though dress code wear look like matter
I like tattoo would never get one understand everyone share idea
If heavily customer facing roll lot face face contact I may consider outward appearance I know people tend make false judgment based look
I think anything
This answer would hurt lot friend feeling I think tattoo aesthetically unappealing seeing someone tattoo lessens respect ability make sound judgement
So yes employer manager I would le likely someone whose arm covered tattoo
I love tattoo
But I judgment people show work place
If mean wearing long sleeve time meeting
You thought got
All mine covered short sleeve shirt accident
Pieces may poke barely noticeable really huge flame going forearm
And tattoo visible love god get touched age
I care faded tattoo trashy
It like ironing shirt combing hair expensive
I agree
And I make hiring decision
I would never voice opinion reason one tattoo gon na sway decision
But making first impression I sit across table massive quote arm something really visible make look super unprofessional
Sorry I pretty surprised someone agrees one
I thinking analogy renter known previously made indelible drawing apartment wall would reason give apartment
I think
The thing
I understand people naive think kind image want body year old kind image want body
In interview I might ask tattoo see applicant actually say
I thinking analogy renter known previously made indelible drawing apartment wall would reason give apartment
I think
This breathtakingly specious
You comparing property damage renting tatoos programming
I sure say except I feel sorry people whose career might influence
It simply judgement character come hiring decision
In fact I interviewed hired I always think HARD question prospective bos SEEM like douche
If guy seems like douche whatever something banal liking tie facial I going prefer bos
I think good case tattoo property damage
It unprofessional ask candidate tattoo opinion
I mean private life
Why want know
If something directly impact ability perform work company place interviewing process
In word work customer might ask otherwise I see justify kind question
If someone lot visible tattoo I would probably question ability objectively judge situation
I mean I absolutely nothing tattoo let honest general perception tattoo le favourable
Why would hinder entire life put risk discrimination
I said I might ask given situation I thinking tattoo situation company always selling whether employee maybe candidate would say something ingenious make tattoo seem le important
I would use interview question could possibly improve pending negative outcome
I bit confused analogy I think I see tattoo correlate developer performance
Or see tattoo poor decision could reflected work
If I think I could agree
Let say candidate face fully tattooed
I think someone kind le form tattoo could make bad impression company internally externally customer employer take guy seriously person decided tattoo face destructive tendency
I think guy likely decide come work something work put company liability something illegal
Part think tattoo form defacement much matter one carving initial bathroom stall carving skull crossbones skin
Okay I guess I see point
In case extreme I definitely see hesitation deserved could come
Just clarify extend minor case
I curious I interned smallish company summer almost developer tattooed
I assume conservative outlet finance etc would case I like hear think
For really would make difference something look peaceful enormous
It would make difference I thought scary looking violent looking offensive
There guy I see walking around neighborhood given whole face multicolored lizard skin horn stripe
Maybe I immature I always get little scared I see
I would interested knowing someone something like
A woman butterfly ankle would absolutely fine
Then lot case two
person decided tattoo face destructive tendency okay Freud You hate tattoo want pretend real psychological justification hiring somebody one
You like
Personally I tattoo could never see getting one I really think matter developer tattoo
And always hear looking bad customer many job software engineer directly interact client
You hate tattoo want pretend real psychological justification hiring somebody one
You like
I disagree
For wanting permanently alter destroy part body thinking might responsible person
A facial tattoo like huge fuck rest world
Do want someone working tendency make act
As I said another message engineer represents company whether ever directly interacts client
If I think sending bad message going negative point hiring decision
For wanting permanently alter destroy part body real psychological justification thinking might responsible person Ah I see
I take would also hire anyone male female wear earring
A facial tattoo like huge fuck rest world
Interesting
I impression facial tattoo facial tattoo various reason getting one
But apparently literally everyone face tattoo want tell world fuck
As I said another message engineer represents company internally whether ever directly interacts client
What mean representing company internally
Internally matter performance worker satisfaction
If engineer great work care tattoo dress casually work make life choice disagree
Who going affected beyond people like view acceptable deprive person job largely irrelevant personal choice
I think hiding behind guise professionalism justify discrimination personally
Ah I see
I take would also hire anyone male female wear earring
Earrings taken
If hole go away care small enough almost nobody going see
But apparently literally everyone face tattoo want tell world fuck
This I said I might ask candidate facial tattoo
If interesting origin story I likely sympathetic
What mean representing company internally
It simple
I nice female employee take care body freaked every time see employee X permanently modified facial skin sake societal rebellion whatever
If guy appearance make u le likely keep good make team interaction le efficient detriment another candidate equally WITHOUT body modification
I think hiding behind guise professionalism justify discrimination personally
Well thank calling discriminatory
I would also le likely hire someone dirty shirt visible snot nose body odor decided remove teeth post video social medium
The way care body mind make difference term valuable organization
Get used
Earrings taken
If hole go away care small enough almost nobody going see
So I take make employee pierced ear remove earring entering workplace
I even need leave question rhetorical obviously
So clearly lying either thread hire people tattoo
This I said I might ask candidate facial tattoo
If interesting origin story I likely sympathetic
I see relevance
Their story could I got stupidly drunk one night decided tattoo face could belong ethnic group tattoo cultural significance
I think care justification either situation
It simple
I nice female employee take care body freaked every time see employee X permanently modified facial skin sake societal rebellion whatever
If guy appearance make u le likely keep good make team interaction le efficient detriment another candidate equally WITHOUT body modification
And would hired great engineer could stand painted fingernail
Fire everyone paint nail
Whose problem employee ca stand people make different choice present
I would much rather fire one whose work performance taking hit silly issue like
Well thank calling discriminatory
I would also le likely hire someone dirty shirt visible snot nose body odor decided remove teeth post video social medium
The way care body mind make difference term valuable organization
Get used
I view scenario equivalent
Being person happens tattoo different showing completely disheveled
What Indian bindi
Does convey right professionalism slightly modified appearance face
You able produce appropriate justification belief one
Again like tattoo people get
Which fine keep decision
You getting voted kiddos tattoo feeling regretful
I agree visible tattoo ok tech
Nobody questioning sincere belief armchair psychology
It still armchair psychology
I pretty sure psychologist sit armchair
It physiological truth tattoo self harm
Jesus Christ like transported
long tattoo offensive depends company HR policy
If working client directly matter
I seen tattoo massive facial hair best engineer I worked
Title Software Engineer
In Austin huge tattoo culture see heavily tattood people almost every career position definitely including service position well
I never heard anyone comment negatively
Ca imagine relevance would
I guess depends company local culture
Tattoos play differently Alabama SF Bay I guess
I work I make hiring decision view It depends tattoo visible person interacting
I hesitant give someone neck face tattoo working directly client client would morally opposed client might take person seriously would ultimately limit type client person could work
If going working home lot working one corner office interfacing small department I would care much long manager okay concern tattoo would offend reasonable person
If going interfacing people department I may hesitant depending tattoo much would actually show time would depend culture department culture overall company
This get grey area tattoo one overtly offensive arguably big deal someone say legal finance team might uncomfortable seeing regular basis like anarchy symbol inverted pentagram
It would something like visible probably gon na come debrief concern
As hiring manager I would slight initial negative bias towards someone obvious extensive tattoo
Just I would think may inverse correlation people get ton tattoo people grok programming
However I would say ability fizzbuzz provides time signal tattoo
As candidate would risk
Wear long sleeve shirt
It cost nothing eliminates one random source negative bias
Reading thread make super happy work game
My tattoo many visible summer welcome place I work
The thing say I enjoy decorating body important life experience absolutely nothing I code ability job
People certainly take le seriously visible
Granted interviewing covered show making effort I would never accept position I every day
Tattoos fine long pleasant around job I fine
Hell I hire former porn star could job dick people
I think many people may bias though cover
deleted But I wanted butt cheek office one day

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I trying understand proof constructing searching give shortest path two point avoiding set convex polygon
I trying justify using visibility graph algorithm spherical polygon transformed linear plane result shortest path using great circle distance two point sphere circle
To I need understand assumption visibility graph need valid I see still true mapping
On page Discrete Computation Geometry Mitchell state It easy show locally optimal path must visibility graph VG P Referring fact shortest path two point navigating around polygonal obstacle found creating visibility graph searching visibility graph using algorithm like
He however explicitly state know path visibility graph
The paper people cite original Visibility Graph algorithm An Algorithm Planning Paths Among Polyhedral Obstacle stating The shortest path S G plane shortest path VGRAPH node corresponding S corresponding G euclidean metric used link
We call method finding path point finding shortest path visibility graph VGRAPH algorithm
This method used navigating SHAKEY early robot vehicle also described detail
They however fail say know true
The SHAKEY paper also mention proof
Now give proof shortest path consist entirely endpoint obstacle implying visibility graph Lemma Any shortest path pstart pgoal among set S disjoint polygonal obstacle polygonal path whose inner vertex vertex Proof
Suppose contradiction shortest path polygonal
Since obstacle polygonal mean point p lie interior free space property line segment containing p contained
Since p interior free space disc positive radius centered p completely contained free space
But part inside disc straight line segment shortened replacing segment connecting point enters disc point leaf disc
This contradicts optimality since shortest path must locally shortest subpath connecting point q r path must shortest path q Now consider vertex v
It lie interior free space would disc centered p completely free space could replace subpath inside turn straight line segment shorter
Similarly v lie relative interior obstacle edge would disc centered v half disc contained free space implies replace subpath inside disc straight line segment
The possibility left v obstacle vertex
They however give citation proof
Is previous version proof original
Are way writing proof
I think first proof given thesis page
With result immediate realize shortest path problem line segment obstacle solved first constructing graph V E called visibility graph V consists two distinguished point set endpoint given N line segment E set edge connects two vertex j V without intersecting obstacle except possibly endpoint j visible according Definition weight associated edge j E Euclidean distance point j applying well known shortest path algorithm However line segment obstacle polygon obstacle
By posting answer agree

This question already answer From python A defines visibility name within block
If local variable defined block scope includes block
When name used code block resolved using nearest enclosing scope
So obviously quote scope mean
Is true scope collection binding
And mean
Does mean every scope must contain reference
This question marked exact duplicate existing question
Martjin Pieters clarification answer awesome I like add beyond python scope computer concept span across basically programming language currently use
To learn scope generally aside python I start Many language including python follow set basic scoping rule detail different language
Thus really asking scope
starting general source may useful learning intricacy python scoping least first

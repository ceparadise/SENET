In degree software used specified consumer achieve quantified objective effectiveness efficiency satisfaction quantified context use
The object use process anything human interacts
A usability study may conducted primary job function secondary job function marketing personnel others
It widely used object cookbook document object door handle hammer
Usability includes method usability study principle behind object perceived efficiency elegance
In usability study elegance clarity computer program web site designed
Usability differs usability directly consider usefulness utility
The primary notion usability object designed generalized user mind example Complex computer system find way everyday life time market saturated competing
This made usability popular widely recognized recent year company see benefit researching developing product method instead method
By understanding researching product user also provide insight unattainable traditional
For example observing interviewing user usability expert may identify needed functionality design flaw anticipated
A method called naturally occurring context user environment
In product designed intended user mind time
In paradigm user become actual member design team
The term often used synonym though may also refer
Usability describes quality user experience across website software product environment
There consensus relation term usability
Some think usability specialization larger topic ergonomics
Others view topic tangential ergonomics focusing physiological matter turning door handle usability focusing psychological matter recognizing door opened turning handle
Usability also important website development
According Studies user behavior Web find low tolerance difficult design slow site
People want wait
And want learn use home page
There thing training class manual Web site
People able grasp functioning site immediately scanning home second
Otherwise casual user simply leave site browse shop elsewhere
defines usability The extent product used specified user achieve specified goal effectiveness efficiency satisfaction specified context use
The word usability also refers method improving design process
Usability consultant computer science professor written separately framework system acceptability usability part usefulness composed Usability often associated functionality product cf
definition addition solely characteristic cf
framework system acceptability also separate
For example context mainstream consumer product automobile lacking reverse gear could considered according former view according latter view
When evaluating user interface usability definition simple perception target user effectiveness fit purpose efficiency work time required use Interface
Each component may measured subjectively criterion Principles User Interface Design provide metric often expressed percentage
It important distinguish usability testing usability engineering
measurement ease use product piece software
In contrast UE research design process ensures product good usability
Usability
As requirement usability directly measured must quantified mean indirect measure attribute example number reported problem system
The term often listed desirable trait usable interface often used synonym
Some expert discouraged using term user interface design claiming easy use interface often easy user exposure previous similar system thus term preferred
As example Two vertical line medium player button intuitively mean pause convention
Aiming intuitive interface based reusing existing skill interaction system could lead designer discard better design solution would require novel approach
This position sometimes illustrated remark The intuitive interface nipple everything else learned
even denies existence intuitive interface since interface must able intuit perceive pattern user behavior draw inference
Instead advocate term intuitable user could intuit working application seeing using
He continues however But even le useful goal since percent population depends intuition perceive anything

When choosing method consider cost time constraint appropriateness
For brief overview method see continue reading
Usability method classified subcategories
Cognitive modeling involves creating computational model estimate long take people perform given task
Models based psychological principle experimental study determine time cognitive processing motor movement
Cognitive model used improve user interface predict problem error pitfall design process
A example cognitive model include With parallel design several people create initial design set requirement
Each person work independently finished share concept group
The design team considers solution designer us best idea improve solution
This process help generate many different diverse idea ensures best idea design integrated final concept
This process repeated several time team satisfied final concept
stand
It family technique analyzes user complexity interactive system
Goals user must accomplish
An operator action performed pursuit goal
A method sequence operator accomplish goal
Selection rule specify method satisfies given goal based context
Sometimes useful break task analyze individual aspect separately
This help tester locate specific area improvement
To necessary understand human brain process information

Many study done estimate cycle time decay time capacity processor
Variables affect include subject age ability surrounding environment
For younger adult reasonable estimate memory believed infinite capacity decay time
Keystroke level modeling essentially le comprehensive version GOMS make simplifying assumption order reduce calculation time complexity
These usability evaluation method involve observation user experimenter testing evaluation program expert reviewer
They provide quantitative data task timed recorded
way involve user grouping information website usability review
Participants card sorting session asked organize content Web site way make sense
Participants review item Web site group item category
Card sorting help learn user think content would organize information Web site
Card sorting help build structure Web site decide put home page label home page category
It also help ensure information organized site way logical user
way evaluate effectiveness website organization
Participants given find task asked drill successive text list topic subtopics find suitable answer
Tree testing evaluates labeling topic site separate navigation control
analysis derived anthropology
Field observation taken site possible user track artifact work note item desktop shortcut item trash bin
These observation also gather sequence work interruption determine user typical day
usability engineering method finding assessing usability problem user interface design part iterative design process
It involves small set evaluator examining interface using recognized usability principle heuristic
It popular usability inspection method quick cheap easy
Heuristic evaluation developed aid design computer design
It relies expert reviewer discover usability problem categorize rate set principle heuristic
It widely used based speed
Jakob Nielsen list ten heuristic commonly used industry
These ten general principle user interface design
They called heuristic nature rule thumb specific usability guideline
Thus determining guideline violated usability device determined
review system based set guideline
The review conducted group expert deeply familiar concept usability design
The expert focus list area design shown troublesome user
Pluralistic Inspections meeting user developer human factor people meet together discus evaluate step step task scenario
As people inspect scenario problem higher probability find problem
In addition interaction team faster usability issue resolved
In consistency inspection expert designer review product project ensure consistency across multiple product look thing way design
Activity analysis usability method used preliminary stage development get sense situation
It involves investigator observing user work field
Also referred user observation useful specifying user requirement studying currently used task subtasks
The data collected qualitative useful defining problem
It used wish frame needed What want know
The following usability evaluation method involve collecting qualitative data user
Although data collected subjective provides valuable information user want
Task analysis mean learning user goal user way working
Task analysis also mean figuring specific task user must meet goal step must take accomplish task
Along user task analysis third analysis often used understanding user environment physical social cultural technological environment
A focus group focused discussion moderator lead group participant set question particular topic
Although typically used marketing tool sometimes used evaluate usability
Used product definition stage group user gathered discus desire product
An experienced focus group facilitator hired guide discussion area interest developer
Focus group typically videotaped help get verbatim quote clip often used summarize opinion
The data gathered usually quantitative help get idea target group opinion
advantage inexpensive require testing equipment result reflect user opinion
When written carefully given actual user experience product knowledge design survey provide useful feedback strong weak area usability design
This common method often appear survey warranty card
It often difficult designer conduct usability test exact system designed
Cost constraint size design constraint usually lead designer creating prototype system
Instead creating complete final system designer may test different section system thus making several small model component system
The type usability prototype may vary using paper model index card hand drawn model storyboards
Prototypes able modified quickly often faster easier create le time invested designer apt change design although sometimes adequate representation whole system often durable testing result may parallel actual system
Rapid prototyping method used early stage development validate refine usability system
It used quickly cheaply evaluate design without need expensive working model
This help remove hesitation change design since implemented real programming begin
One method rapid prototyping
These usability evaluation method involve testing subject quantitative data
Usually recorded video provide task completion time allow observation attitude
Regardless carefully system designed theory must tested using usability test
Usability test involve typical user using system product realistic environment see
Observation user behavior emotion difficulty performing different task often identify area improvement system
While conducting usability test designer must use usability metric identify going measure usability metric
These metric often variable change conjunction scope goal project
The number subject tested also affect usability metric often easier focus specific demographic
Qualitative design phase general usability task accomplished
user satisfaction also typically done smaller group subject
Using inexpensive prototype small user group provides detailed information interactive atmosphere designer ability focus individual user
As design become complex testing must become formalized
Testing equipment become sophisticated testing metric become quantitative
With refined prototype designer often test effectiveness efficiency subjective satisfaction asking user complete various task
These category measured percent complete task long take complete task ratio success failure complete task time spent error number error rating scale satisfaction number time user seems frustrated etc
Additional observation user give designer insight navigation difficulty control conceptual model etc
The ultimate goal analyzing metric prototype design user like use successfully perform given task
After conducting usability test important designer record observed addition behavior occurred modify model according result
Often quite difficult distinguish source design error user wrong
However effective usability test generate solution problem provide modified design guideline continued testing
Remote usability testing also known unmoderated asynchronous usability testing involves use specially modified online survey allowing quantification user testing study providing ability generate large sample size deep qualitative analysis without need dedicated facility
Additionally style user testing also provides opportunity segment feedback demographic attitudinal behavioral type
The test carried user environment rather lab helping simulate scenario testing
This approach also provides vehicle easily solicit feedback user remote area
There two type quantitative qualitative
Quantitative use large sample sized task based survey
These type study useful validating suspected usability issue
Qualitative study best used exploratory research small sample size frequent even daily iteration
Qualitative usually allows observing respondent screen verbal think aloud commentary Screen Recording Video SRV richer level insight also include webcam view respondent ViV sometimes referred PiP The growth mobile associated platform service
Mobile gaming experienced growth generated need unmoderated remote usability testing mobile device website especially app interaction
One methodology consists shipping camera special camera holding fixture dedicated tester record screen mobile tablet device usually using HD camera
A drawback approach finger movement respondent obscure view screen addition bias logistical issue inherent shipping special hardware selected respondent
A newer approach us wireless projection mobile device screen onto computer desktop screen respondent recorded webcam thus combined view participant screen interaction viewed simultaneously incorporating verbal think aloud commentary respondent
The method gathering data used usability psychology study
It involves getting user verbalize thought process perform task set task
Often instructor present prompt user vocal work
Similar method useful pinpointing problem relatively simple set
Additionally provide insight user attitude usually discerned survey questionnaire
Rapid Iterative Testing Evaluation RITE iterative usability method similar traditional discount usability testing
The tester team must define target population testing schedule participant come lab decide user behavior measured construct test script participant engage verbal protocol think aloud
However differs method advocate change user interface made soon problem identified solution clear
Sometimes occur observing participant
Once data participant collected usability engineer team decide making change prototype prior next participant
The changed interface tested remaining user
also called pairing subject usability test gather important information ease use product
Subjects tend discus task accomplish loud discussion observer learn problem area design
To encourage two subject attendant discussion leading test designed make subject dependent assigning complementary area responsibility
testing software one subject may put charge mouse keyboard
approach aim test usability elementary unit interaction system referred interaction component
The approach includes quantitative measure based user interaction recorded log file usability questionnaire
method evaluating user interaction working prototype final product
It used evaluate system ease learning
Cognitive walk useful understand user thought process decision making interacting system specially infrequent user
creates standardized test material specific type design
Four key characteristic considered establishing benchmark time core task time fix error time learn application functionality system
Once benchmark design compared determine usability system
Many common objective usability study trying understand user behavior exploring alternative design must put aside
Unlike many usability method type lab study benchmark study closely resemble true experimental psychology lab study greater attention detail methodology study protocol data analysis
statistical procedure combine result across study integrate finding
This phrase coined literature review
This type evaluation powerful determining usability device combine multiple study provide accurate quantitative support
fictitious character created represent site product different user type associated demographic technographics
introduced concept using persona part interactive design book used concept since early
Personas usability evaluation method used various design stage
The typical time create persona beginning designing designer tangible idea user product
Personas represent actual group user need general description person context usage scenario
This technique turn marketing data target user population physical concept user create empathy among design team final aim tailoring product closely persona use
To gather data persona require several tool used including online survey customer feedback form usability test interview representative
The key benefit usability An increase usability generally positively affect several facet company output quality
In particular benefit fall several common area Increased usability workplace foster several response employee Workers enjoy work better stay longer face temptation contribute idea enthusiasm evolution enhanced productivity
To create standard company often implement experimental design technique create baseline level
Areas concern office environment include though necessarily limited By working improve said factor corporation achieve goal increased output lower cost potentially creating optimal level customer satisfaction
There numerous reason factor correlate overall improvement
For example making software user interface easier understand reduces need extensive training
The improved interface tends lower time needed perform task would raise productivity level employee reduce development time thus cost
Each aforementioned factor mutually exclusive rather understood work conjunction form overall workplace environment
In usability recognized important software quality attribute earning place among traditional attribute aesthetic appearance
Various academic program focus usability
Several usability company emerged traditional consultancy design firm offer similar service
There resistance integrating usability work organisation
Usability seen vague concept difficult measure area prioritised IT project run time money
Usability practitioner sometimes trained industrial engineer psychologist system design engineer degree information architecture information library science
More often though people trained specific applied field taken usability focus within organization
Anyone aim make tool easier use effective desired function within context work everyday living benefit studying usability principle guideline

So kindly somebody could explain help example cardinality database
Thank You
A source confusion may use word two different context data modelling database query optimization
In data modelling term cardinality one table relates another
There also optional participation condition row one table relate table
See Wikipedia
When talking database query optimization cardinality refers data column table specifically many unique value
This statistic help planning query optimizing execution plan
See Wikipedia
It depends bit context
Cardinality mean number something get used variety context
There probably situation people talk cardinality using different context mean something else
Cardinality refers uniqueness data contained column
If column lot duplicate data
column store either true false low cardinality value highly unique
Social Security number high cardinality
In database refers set row table
image Cardinality set namber element set set b c th set contain element cardinality set Definition We table database
In relational database relation among table
These relation
These relation called
Significant cardinality Many relational database designed following stick business design database define cardinality based business rule
But every object nature well
When define cardinality among object consider thing define correct cardinality
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

My school book defines cardinality follows The cardinality relation number tuples contains
By contrast number tuples called cardinality relation change tuples added deleted
many tuples tuples
While Wikipedia article defines follows Cardinality refers uniqueness data value contained particular column attribute database table
The lower cardinality duplicated element column
There type cardinality
They might right ca connect two definition related definition
A rephrase would appriciated
They speaking thing tuples row layman term
When say possible value particular attribute field unique therefore number row tuples higher As far unique
In five
On hand normal cardinality particular three unique
Thus
And finally two possible unique tuples thus
You probably confuse relation something number relation table
On hand textbook speaking normally entity relation another entity number possible relation occurences entity participating given relationship type
Thus example could either
Both definition trying say cardinality number row
The difference whether comparison table particular column
The version database text book focus relational algebra structure table relation lingo
The Wikipedia entry practical
It encompasses textbook definition assuming table primary key cardinality primary key table
However applied say flag column well
If flag take two value versus say cardinality column
This important optimizing query
Cardinality one component choosing best method joining aggregating selecting data
In practice database use information cardinality statistic column value optimization
If table A B think cardinality number row table B would related row table A
If table PERSON VEHICLE relation cardinality high person rode lot different vehicle past vehicle drove many person
If relation OWNS cardinality low person one vehicle none vehicle usually one two owner
Note cardinality one side relation equal cardinality side
If table PERSON FINGER relation BELONG TO person many finger finger belongs one person

What cardinality set regular grammar
The caveat I interested grammar different
Sorry I know talk formal way I mean actual symbol arbitrary
So example grammar x Is equivalent grammar Hopefully I understood
I believe set countable every N finite number production rule formulated
For example x The unique set production rule There least one regular grammar per regular language pairwise inequivalent meaningful equivalence relation
Since least countably infinite number regular lower bound number regular grammar well
Without loss write every regular grammar finite string finite alphabet
Therefore many regular grammar binary string countably infinitely many
Combine bound get answer

In database design fundamental principle one data aspect respect another critical feature
The relationship one must precise exact order explain aspect link together
In table related
This said given table relation another
For example consider database designed keep track hospital record
Such database could many table like In model A relationship mostly used split table two order provide information concisely make understandable
In hospital example relationship could used keep apart doctor unique professional information administrative detail
In collection data element grouped data table contain group data field name called database attribute
Tables linked key field
A primary key assigns field special order table
For example Doctor Last Name field might assigned primary key Doctor table people last name organized alphabetically according first three letter first name
A table also indicates field linked primary key another table
A complex data model involve hundred related table
A renowned computer scientist created systematic method decompose organize
Codd step organizing database table key called avoids certain hidden database design error
In real life process database normalization end breaking table larger number smaller table
In real world data modeling critical data grows voluminous table linked key must used speed programmed retrieval data
If data model poorly crafted even computer application system million record give unacceptable response time delay
For reason data modeling keystone skill needed modern software developer
The proposes technique produce diagram ERDs employed capture information data model entity type relationship cardinality
A show relationship
Alternatively single line represents relationship
In application programming paradigm decidedly marginal database structure design may used modeling subsequently mapped proper data modeling method
In case object relationship modeled using UML association multiplicity used association denote
Here example

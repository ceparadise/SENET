In duplication critical function system intention increasing reliability usually form backup improve actual system performance case receiver computer processing
In many system part control system may triplicated formally termed TMR
An error one component may two
In triply redundant system system three sub component three must fail system fails
Since one rarely fails sub component expected fail independently probability three failing calculated extraordinarily small often outweighed risk factor human error
Redundancy may also known term majority voting system voting logic
Redundancy sometimes produce le instead greater reliability creates complex system prone various issue may lead human neglect duty may lead higher production demand overstressing system may make le safe
In computer science four major form redundancy A modified form software redundancy applied hardware may usually designed redundant part well ensuring one part fails entire structure collapse
A structure without redundancy called meaning single broken component cause collapse entire structure
Bridges failed due lack redundancy include
Parallel combined system demonstrate different level redundancy
The model subject study reliability safety engineering
The two function redundancy passive redundancy
Both function prevent performance decline exceeding specification limit without human intervention using extra capacity
Passive redundancy us excess capacity reduce impact component failure
One common form passive redundancy extra strength cabling strut used bridge
This extra strength allows structural component fail without bridge collapse
The extra strength used design called margin safety
Eyes ear provide working example passive redundancy
Vision loss one eye cause blindness depth perception impaired
Hearing loss one ear cause deafness directionality impaired
Performance decline commonly associated passive redundancy limited number failure occur
Active redundancy eliminates performance decline monitoring performance individual device monitoring used voting logic
The voting logic linked switching automatically reconfigures component
Error detection correction Global Positioning System GPS two example active redundancy
Electrical power distribution provides example active redundancy
Several power line connect generation facility customer
Each power line includes monitor detect overload
Each power line also includes circuit breaker
The combination power line provides excess capacity
Circuit breaker disconnect power line monitor detect overload
Power redistributed across remaining line
author said sometimes redundancy backfire produce le reliability
This may happen three way First redundant safety device result complex system prone error accident
Second redundancy may lead shirking responsibility among worker
Third redundancy may lead increased production pressure resulting system operates higher speed le safely
Voting logic us performance monitoring determine reconfigure individual component operation continues without violating specification limitation overall system
Voting logic often involves computer system composed item computer may reconfigured using voting logic
Circuit breaker example form voting logic
Electrical power system use reconfigure active redundancy
Computing system adjust production output generating facility generating facility suddenly lost
This prevents blackout condition major event earthquake
The simplest voting logic computing system involves two component primary alternate
They run similar software output alternate remains inactive normal operation
The primary monitor periodically sends activity message alternate long everything All output primary stop including activity message primary detects fault
The alternate activates output take primary brief delay activity message cease
Errors voting logic cause output active inactive time cause output flutter
A reliable form voting logic involves odd number three device
All perform identical function output compared voting logic
The voting logic establishes majority disagreement majority act deactivate output device disagree
A single fault interrupt normal operation
This technique used system responsible operation
Each duplicate component added system decrease probability system failure according formula This formula assumes independence failure event
That mean probability component B failing given component A already failed B failing A failed
There situation unreasonable using two power supply connected socket way one power supply failed would
It also assumes one component needed keep system running

The general definition redundancy exceeding normal
However computing term used specifically refers duplicate device used purpose
The goal redundancy prevent recover failure specific system
There many type redundant device
The common personal computing backup
While computer component easily replaced fails may possible recover personal data
Therefore important regularly back data secondary hard drive
In enterprise situation configuration used mirror data across two drive
Another type redundant device secondary
High traffic critical system may multiple power supply take case primary one fails
While uninterruptible power supply technically redundant device battery within surge protector provides power redundancy minute electricity lost
Computer network often implement redundancy well
From Internet connection common redundant data path
This mean one system go connection system broken
For example network duplicate data ring used automatically primary data path interrupted
Network redundancy accomplished either adding extra physical connection using networking software automatically reroutes data needed

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
My Computing teacher talk data duplication data redundancy term database different thing I struggling differentiate
The context database normalisation particular third normal form important eliminates data duplication redundancy
But far I see term relate data appearing database
Yes I asked teacher I understand explanation group revision session I want hold
When create table database may want create duplication Here would duplicate name user table
That way display list friend access user table read name
This simple example show call data duplication
Duplication mean YOU responsible also updating name parameter friend table change name user table
If consistently data becomes inconsistent user start seeing strange thing happening
In case redundancy two copy piece data
The database though
This useful safety
For example place database two separate computer
If one computer go data available computer
Redundancy definitively copy access either version data exactly
The RDBM may choose one based different parameter fast whether computer network connection
The RDBM manages copy consistent way problem I mentioned user name
If RDBM asked update user name update version copy
The good thing time INSERT UPDATE delay update copy computer
So implementers database exactly opposite told make duplicate data
probably main source confusion realm
You may want read fun thing respect
Cassandra type database used Google update data ring computer possibly heavy redundancy
Since asked I also let know RDBMs make use call Indexes And Indexes duplicate data
To continue user example name user could used index
The Index would look like example When UPDATE user table RDBM need also update index move name new position maintaining consistency SQL warrant data always consistent So renaming Alexis Tristan would give new index And see duplication actually necessary
And see handle properly without ever losing existing data understand duplication difficult deal
By posting answer agree

The field software computing computer science plagued tremendous underrepresentation woman African Americans Hispanics
In high school Advanced Placement exam Computer Science worst gender diversity across course percent participation men percent woman
Participation student color percent
These underrepresented group represent percent entire US population
This problem extends software workplace suffers similar lack diversity
Obviously many issue address solve entire problem diversity tech workforce unconscious bias hiring retention practice university program
We work help connect work bigger picture
The chart show participation AP Computer Science exam among female student underrepresented minority since
Not overall participation grown overall proportion traditionally underrepresented group increasing
Although chart barometer work popularize computer science break stereotype build pipeline improvement result work alone
Besides organization working diversity tech real credit belongs thousand teacher worked year improve diversity classroom
While thing moving right direction long way go reach balanced population AP Computer Science focus entire pathway
Addressing diversity issue foundational work woven throughout program curriculum teacher professional learning advocacy marketing
We focus gender socioeconomic diversity also increasing participation among underrepresented minority African Americans student Native Native Islanders
We increase diversity computer science reaching student background school way inspire keep learning
Of course teacher integrate computer science classroom student attend immediate impact diversity
Though black Latinx American Indian Native Pacific Islander student dramatically underrepresented university computer science department making CS major AP Computer Science exam may seem le interested studying computer science white Asian peer
But participation course suggests opposite
We ran analysis high school CS Principles classroom turn underrepresented minority choose sign CS class much higher rate national AP data would suggest
The chart show data hundred computer science classroom
We compared percent underrepresented minority school whole percent among student enroll course
The orange dot represent computer science classroom diverse school whole
The blue dot le diverse
Almost classroom diverse school whole classroom track close even balance
When teacher administrator diverse school offer curriculum designed support underrepresented minority participation high school dramatically exceeds nationwide number reality tech industry today
Below example tactic use address diversity issue
From elementary school way high school course designed specifically focus diversity recruitment traditionally underrepresented student
This factored curriculum
For example high school course sequencing begin student unit instead jumping directly computer programming allows student learn together even playing field even student already learned code summer camp school
Across produce recruited wide cast lecturer featuring celebrated technologist like Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg also woman underrepresented minority computing Paola Minaya hispanic engineer Microsoft Tess Winlock female engineer Google Makinde Adeagbo early African American engineer Facebook Pinterest Kate Starbird WNBA basketball player computer scientist University Washington
By casting wide range lecturer diverse CS role model different industry baked curriculum material
The result speak All professional development workshop teacher include session equity access help teacher build awareness stereotype give tool recruit retain diverse CS student population
We also host professional development workshop district administrator counselor play critical role helping high school student choose field study order guide help recruit diverse student new computer science help establish school
By focusing effort school underserved population particularly urban rural geography reach student typically participate computer science
The result evident course designed ground broaden participation computer science
Endorsed College Board course prepares student new AP exam computer science
helped expand access course urban school district New York City Chicago Oakland well rural school Idaho Alabama
Because focus reaching underprivileged student underrepresented minority enrolled CS Principles classroom total nation AP Computer Science exam taker
Our early advocacy effort focused allowing rigorous computer science course count towards math science high school graduation requirement
Polling done Computer Science Teachers Association show woman underrepresented minority decide whether study Computer Science key factor choice whether count graduation credit
In state computer science count towards high school graduation enrollment underrepresented minority percent higher state
past success changing graduation policy state hopefully improve enrollment underrepresented group
As simple example showed policy resulting female representation computer science
Moving forward advocacy effort focused expanding access computer science especially underprivileged school
By offering computer science every school increase enrollment among female increase among African American female
This show massive impact state policy CS help advocacy effort state
The Hour Code international campaign recruit student try computer science one hour
A significant reason break stereotype CS nerdy boy showing student everybody
This stereotype prime reason girl avoid CS
The way organizing participation recruiting teacher offer Hour Code classroom
These math teacher english teacher science teacher balance boy girl communicate anybody try
A student participating Hour Code showed significant improvement attitude towards computer science The result speak million hour served participant female Hour Code effort introduce computer science girl
We also distributed CS teacher help recruit woman classroom
For example produced video specifically highlighting female role model talking importance learning computer science
We also proud according woman team

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

use predefined programming modular unit object class subclass forth order make programming faster easier maintain
language help manage complexity large program
Objects package data operation operation publicly accessible internal detail data structure hidden
This information hiding made programming easier allowing programmer think part program isolation
In addition object may derived general one inheriting capability
Such object made possible define specialized object without repeating general one
programming began Simula language added information hiding
Another influential language Smalltalk program set object interacted sending message one another
Since one successful language

In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

In instance
Objects abstraction
They hold data way manipulate data
The data usually visible outside object
It changed using mechanism usually called
Suppose bank account bank account current balance also thing done
These field however directly accessible
There method like
Most application object change object interface
Banks usually impose
Suppose dollar account
If client special agreement bank take money account withdraw maximum dollar
He might agreement bank borrow money bank pay fee
In case might able withdraw dollar dollar
So withdraw method lot check described
The account manager might see account differently might method set maximum amount taken account set fee interest rate customer pay money borrowed
As object instance class certain thing class
It perhaps compared object class
Two apple one red bigger green smaller
On hand It easy compare different object
A green apple much common steel wrench

Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

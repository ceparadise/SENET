In many case possible eliminate check possible determine program error occur
For example array access inside FOR loop may safe given bound loop several us pointer successive statement may able share one check pointer
Modify Oberon compiler simpler one taken Compilers lab represents check explicitly IR introduce pas remove unnecessary check speeding code without compromising safety

The guarded negation fragment logic expressive logic interest database knowledge representation
It shown decidable satisfiability problem best knowledge tool actually implementing decision procedure
The goal would design tool determine whether formula logic satisfiable
Most likely would require designing implementing algorithm spirit related tool description logic guarded fragment
Logic Proof equivalent
There connection material Knowledge Representation Reasoning essential background Let sentence logic say entail model also model
An interpolant sentence G entail G G entail G us relation function appear
The goal project explore implement procedure constructing interpolants particularly certain decidable fragment logic

Logic Proof equivalent Computed tomography CT scanning ubiquitous scanning modality
It produce volume data representing internal part human body
Scans usually output standard imaging format DICOM come series axial slice
slice across length person body plane perpendicular imaginary straight line along spine
The slice frequently come resolution x voxels achieving accuracy tissue per voxel viewed analysed using variety tool
The distance slice parameter scanning process typically much larger
During analysis CT data volume often useful correct large spacing slice
For example preparing model printing axial voxels would appear elongated
These could corrected interpolation process along spinal axis
This project interpolation process either raw data output scanner data prepared analysis printing
The output model would ideally file format compatible printing STL
The main aesthetic feature output would measurable smoothness factor parameterisable user

If college student trying pick major maximize career prospect secret computer science good choice
There shortage data report survey find people CS degree expect field study
Now come new survey recent college grad show student major computer science excellent job salary prospect
The survey conducted marketplace internship job published result last week
Looksharp surveyed college student recent graduate past April experience recruiting internship full time job
Some general finding across major student multiple paid internship took online course higher GPAs greater chance landing full time job graduation
In addition published result Looksharp kind enough share additional data specific computer science graduate support notion studying CS wise career choice
Here key finding
The survey found student graduated year le half full time job time survey
However student studied computer science full time job top among major besides military science better rate overall STEM grad general
Additionally CS major full time job offer graduation ranked third behind finance major studying mechanic repair
Of major student studying CS highest average starting salary followed engineering math statistic economics finance
In addition CS grad starting salary started
The survey show CS major aware degree valuable average expected starting salary slightly actual average starting salary
In addition expecting starting salary compared actually got much expected starting salary slightly le actually got job
As Looksharp CMO Nathan Parcells told via email It show student understand demand CS major command figure salary immediately In fact CS student high end continue increase expectation since Parcells explained practice capping salary starting erode company vie new developer
Some growing tech company negotiate willing offer large salary top CS talent said
The survey found student regardless major taken computer science class oftentimes express purpose standing job market Parcells wrote survey report
Among major business student led way taking CS class
These result Parcells told show pervasive skill set becoming student wanting make impact Given computer science major know surprising survey also found little pickier student tradeoff willing consider get job
For example The bottom line computer science continues great choice major student student know

The government regulates transfer information commodity technology software considered strategically important interest national security economic foreign policy concern
There complicated network federal agency regulation govern export collectively referred Export In brief Export Controls regulate shipment transfer whatever mean controlled item software technology service termed Export
Perhaps even consequence university government also restricts release certain information foreign national referred Deemed Export
Export Controls potential severely limit research opportunity university faculty student staff well prevent international collaboration certain research area
export control result severe monetary criminal penalty individual well university result loss research contract governmental funding ability export item
In order ensure compliance export control critically important university personnel identify activity may trigger export control
When export control apply individual must take appropriate step obtain required governmental license monitor control access restricted information safeguard controlled material
Research export restricted science engineering area example include Traveling certain type high tech equipment including limited advanced GPS unit scientific equipment controlled proprietary unpublished data format may require export license depending travel destination
See information
Laptop computer cell phone electronics containing encryption hardware software proprietary software require export license certain destination
In general export license required take item sanctioned country Iran Syria Cuba Sudan North Korea
University activity involving use export controlled information item technology received outside university protected research involving use export restricted technology subject export control
For help determining export control issue see Incoming Export Control Information Questionnaire
The vast majority research done university shielded export control
However protection lost whenever university researcher agrees allow restriction publication dissemination access research foreign national
University activity involve transfer project information equipment material technology whatever mean subject export control may require export license depending item destination recipient
University activity involve international payment fund person abroad need verified ensure university inadvertently providing financial assistance blocked sanctioned entity
Examples include providing support via subcontract university providing payment research subject country
Contact activity involves payment person organization outside University activity involve foreign national faculty student staff visiting foreign scientist collaborator foreign entity company university organization research include travel international conference present unpublished result may subject export control especially foreign national embargoed sanctioned country
See information
Research project part research take place outside
field work outside may qualify may subject export control

An abstract model
It also referred
A realization ISA called
An ISA permit multiple implementation may vary physical size monetary cost among thing ISA serf
Software written ISA run different implementation ISA
This enabled different generation computer easily achieved development computer family
Both development helped lower cost computer increase applicability
For reason ISA one important abstraction today
An ISA defines everything need know order program computer
What ISA defines differs ISAs general ISAs define supported state semantics set comprises computer machine language model
An instruction set architecture distinguished set technique used particular processor implement instruction set
Processors different microarchitectures share common instruction set
For example implement nearly identical version radically different internal design
The concept distinct design specific machine developed IBM design phase
Prior NPL company computer designer free honor cost objective selecting technology also fashioning functional architectural refinement
The SPREAD compatibility objective contrast postulated single architecture series five processor spanning wide range cost performance
None five engineering design team could count able bring adjustment architectural specification way easing difficulty achieving cost performance objective
Some support ISA Microsoft implement translating bytecode commonly used code path native machine code
In addition virtual machine execute le frequently used code path interpretation see
implemented instruction set atop processor fashion
An ISA may classified number different way
A common classification architectural
A CISC many specialized instruction may rarely used practical program
A RISC simplifies processor efficiently implementing instruction frequently used program le common operation implemented subroutine resulting additional processor execution time offset infrequent use
Other type include VLIW architecture closely related LIW EPIC architecture
These architecture seek exploit le hardware RISC CISC making responsible instruction issue scheduling
Architectures even le complexity studied MISC OISC
These theoretically important type commercialized
built discrete
On processing architecture given instruction may specify More complex operation built combining simple instruction executed sequentially otherwise directed instruction
Examples operation common many instruction set include Processors may include complex instruction instruction set
A single complex instruction something may take many instruction computer
Such instruction instruction take multiple step control multiple functional unit otherwise appear larger scale bulk simple instruction implemented given processor
Some example complex instruction include Complex instruction common CISC instruction set RISC instruction set RISC instruction set may include well
RISC instruction set generally include ALU operation memory operand instruction move large block memory RISC instruction set include instruction perform arithmetic operation multiple piece data time
SIMD instruction ability manipulating large vector matrix minimal time
SIMD instruction allow easy algorithm commonly involved sound image video processing
Various SIMD implementation brought market trade name
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifies operation perform zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In VLIW architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous opcodes operand specified single instruction
Some exotic instruction set opcode field TTA operand
The instruction set lack operand specifier field including NOSC
Conditional instruction often predicate bit encode specific condition cause operation performed rather performed
For example conditional branch instruction executed branch taken condition true execution proceeds different part program executed branch taken condition false execution continues sequentially
Some instruction set also conditional move move executed data stored target location condition true executed target location modified condition false
Similarly IBM conditional store instruction
A instruction set include predicate field every instruction called
The size length instruction varies widely little four bit many hundred bit VLIW system
Processors used instruction size bit
The longest possible instruction byte bit
Within instruction set different instruction may different length
In architecture notably RISC typically corresponding architecture
In architecture instruction variable length typically integral multiple
Some variable encoding two fixed usually encoding instruction mixed freely must switched branch exception boundary
A RISC instruction set normally fixed instruction length often byte bit whereas typical CISC instruction set may instruction widely varying length byte
instruction le complicated handle instruction several reason check whether instruction straddle cache line virtual memory page boundary instance therefore somewhat easier optimize speed
The instruction constituting program rarely specified using internal numeric form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
The design instruction set complex issue
There two stage history microprocessor
The first CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer many different instruction
In however place like IBM research found many instruction set could eliminated
The result RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture us smaller set instruction
A simpler instruction set may offer potential higher speed reduced processor size reduced power consumption
However complex set may optimize common operation improve memory efficiency simplify programming
Some instruction set designer reserve one opcodes kind
For example us us eight code CF DF EF FF use code range
Fast virtual machine much easier implement instruction set meet
The used much easier implement unprogrammed state memory interpreted
On system multiple processor algorithm much easier implement instruction set includes support something atomic
Any given instruction set implemented variety way
All way implementing particular instruction set provide implementation instruction set able run executables
The various way implementing instruction set give different tradeoff cost performance power consumption size etc
When designing processor engineer use block electronic circuitry often designed separately adder multiplexer counter register ALUs etc
Some kind often used describe decoding sequencing instruction ISA using physical microarchitecture
There two basic way build implement description although many design use middle way compromise Some design use combination hardwired design microcode control unit
Some CPU design use compile instruction set writable inside CPU processor FPGA
An ISA also software
Naturally due interpretation overhead slower directly running program emulated hardware unless hardware running emulator order magnitude faster
Today common practice vendor new ISAs microarchitectures make software emulator available software developer hardware implementation ready
Often detail implementation strong influence particular instruction selected instruction set
For example many implementation allow single memory load memory store per instruction leading RISC
For another example early way implementing led
The demand digital signal processing pushed opposite instruction implemented particular way
For example perform digital filter fast enough MAC instruction typical DSP must use kind fetch instruction two data word simultaneously requires
In early computer memory expensive minimizing size program make sure would fit limited memory often central
Thus combined size instruction needed perform particular task important characteristic instruction set
Computers high code density often complex instruction procedure entry parameterized return loop etc
therefore retroactively named
However typical frequent CISC instruction merely combine basic ALU operation add access one operand memory using direct indirect indexed etc
Certain architecture may allow two three operand including result directly memory may able perform function automatic pointer increment etc
instruction set may even complex powerful instruction
first widely implemented period rapidly growing memory subsystem
They sacrifice code density simplify implementation circuitry try increase performance via higher clock frequency register
A single RISC instruction typically performs single operation add register load memory location register
A RISC instruction set normally fixed whereas typical CISC instruction set instruction widely varying length
However RISC computer normally require often longer instruction implement given task inherently make le optimal use bus bandwidth cache memory
Certain embedded RISC ISAs like typically exhibit high density owing technique called code compression
This technique pack two instruction one instruction unpacked decode stage executed two instruction
MISC form separate instruction multiple instruction fit single machine word
These type core often take little silicon implement easily realized form
The code density MISC similar code density RISC increased instruction density offset requiring primitive instruction task
There research mechanism improving code density
The mathematics describes challenge limit
Instruction set may categorized maximum number operand specified instruction
In example follow direct calculated address referring memory cell refer machine register
Due large number bit needed encode three register instruction RISC architecture instruction invariably design Atmel AVR version
RISC architecture instruction usually design architecture
Each instruction specifies number operand register memory location immediate value
Some instruction give one operand implicitly stored top implicit register
If operand given implicitly fewer operand need specified instruction
When destination operand explicitly specifies destination additional operand must supplied
Consequently number operand encoded instruction may differ mathematically necessary number argument logical arithmetic operation
Operands either encoded opcode representation instruction else given value address following instruction
measure availability free register point time program execution
Register pressure high large number available register use thus higher register pressure often register content must memory
Increasing number register architecture decrease register pressure increase cost
While embedded instruction set suffer extremely high register pressure small register set RISC ISAs like enjoy low register pressure
CISC ISAs like offer low register pressure despite smaller register set
This due many addressing mode optimization addressing memory operand ALU instruction absolute addressing addressing spill CISC ISAs offer

Department Education

North Beauregard Alexandria VA Tel Fax International Access Code Joyce McLeod Jan Fisher Ginny Hoover The clock seems manage every school day
The daily schedule based variety factor time period given subject bus schedule local school schedule special class lunch period teacher planning time
Wong Wong describe four different type time According research reported Wong Wong typical teacher consumes percent allocated time
Yet way student learns anything putting learning work
In chapter examine basic daily schedule used variety elementary middle high school setting look way use scheduled time maximize instructional time
Time management critical student achievement attitude toward learning
Elementary school schedule generally determined three factor number instructional minute subject area mandated district state special class schedule music art physical education library overall school schedule dictated bus schedule lunch time forth
Time frame subject area elementary grade vary according grade level largest block daily schedule usually devoted reading language art second largest block mathematics
The remaining subject social study health music art physical mandate certain number minute per day week schedule usually left discretion local school special teacher teach art music physical education teacher team teacher scheduling science social study health
The school day kindergarten usually either program
Kindergarten schedule therefore individualized within time frame developed according philosophy guide program
However kindergarten class usually program schedule also driven overall school schedule lunch bus schedule special class music art physical education
One successful way organizing elementary school even middle school make better use instructional time practice looping
In approach student remain one teacher two three teacher student get promoted together
According Jim Grant codirector National Alliance Multiage Educators teacher loop fewer transition make beginning school year introduce curriculum topic right way
By allowing student teacher remain together Grant say looping buy time Rasmussen
This extra time allows teacher teach topic greater depth better meet need individual student
Another organizational option elementary grade vertical team
In configuration one team teacher teach multiple grade level neighborhood concept
The child remain neighborhood team teacher period four five year
Just looping strategy time spent getting know student beginning year teaching routine procedure assessing student learning level eliminated
Teachers benefit knowing student teach following year addition shared teacher planning multigrade activity add richness curriculum
Students individual need easily met setting material multiple grade within reach use grouping meet individual need time efficient
The first day school neighborhood productive comfortable day teacher student return familiar environment
Red Mountain Ranch School Mesa Arizona incorporating nationwide concept using vertical team
See research finding organizational structure
Middle high school basically offer two scheduling option hour period subject area one configuration block scheduling
The middle school schedule generally follows high school schedule order prepare student high school experience
The period schedule based Carnegie Unit scheduling configuration influenced overall organization high school decade
A Carnegie Unit defined James Frey president Educational Credential Evaluations expands definition describing various way secondary school compute annual unit high school work
Although common reporting measure United States secondary school use record subject taught one hour per day five day per week one semester half school year others use record subject taught one hour per week one semester
These three way reporting related follows Frey note although reporting unit hour hour might minute academic year might week long
However inequity time generally ignored curriculum two institution compared United States Education Reference File
The criterion receiving high school diploma based number Carnegie Units earned required course study
Although college university use Carnegie Unit part admission criterion inequity class time defines Carnegie Unit make difficult college admission officer evaluate much time applicant spent required course work
The Carnegie Unit criticized recent year emphasis time spent course instructional organization discrete segment unit earned rather emphasis knowledge acquired Maeroff
Critics also say pace typical student pursues nine different location nine different activity school day grueling
The pace teacher grueling well average teacher teach five class day work student make multiple daily preparation
As Carroll state It produce hectic impersonal inefficient instructional environment provides inadequate time probing idea depth tends discourage using variety learning Individual student learn differing rate different way yet hour period allocates identical time student
In addition lost time occurs multiple class change administrative duty accompany starting ending many class one day
The Carnegie Unit organizational system emphasizes inflexible use time many student serve learning need
In response criticism Carnegie Unit need longer instructional period hour period concept block scheduling introduced
Cawelti defines block scheduling follows Regardless configuration block schedule important issue drastically change way instructional time used instruction delivered
There decreased reliance standard pattern increase individualization creative teaching strategy
These larger block time allow flexible classroom environment teacher use varied interactive style teaching
Figures example two frequently used block schedule configuration
minute minute minute minute minute minute minute On surface block scheduling seems answer time problem inherent Carnegie Unit schedule
However process making change block scheduling challenge
The Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory recommends two year planning implementation
Teachers taught block year need time training order develop skill strategy necessary teach large block time
Teachers successful block scheduling plan lesson include explanation application synthesis
Most teacher little experience application synthesis phase lesson
Another area teacher need training cooperative learning community building team formation
Implementing block scheduling time must carefully considered schedule change actually made
Without consensus among superintendent school board principal teacher student parent change likely met strong resistance
Building support stakeholder take time requires many opportunity party learn proposed new schedule discus ramification change Carroll
Teachers need time professional development help implement new schedule develop ability use instructional strategy appropriately longer time period
Scheduling plan must carefully developed ensure student provided time opportunity complete requirement high school graduation
So although block scheduling offer alternative Carnegie Unit schedule implementing change time issue also issue touch heart nature high school
Steve Krasner compiled extensive bibliography resource block scheduling use time school
Although teacher little control mandated daily schedule curriculum control allocate time teach standard objective
Teachers responsibility pacing year curriculum involve two important element teaching key course content depth ensures student master word teaching curriculum favor depth breadth rather inch deep mile wide assessing learning need student providing intervention help student move along continuum learning experience allows achieve standard
Instructional pacing directly related time allocation
Too many time teacher reach midpoint school year realize way accomplish year work even cover upcoming test
So pacing must begin first day new school year
The following suggestion help make important decision pacing instruction Refer every week plan lesson
Quickly finding pacing plan either ambitious student pace instruction slow buy time spend topic alert need assist student pacing rigorous
Accountability demand take macro look curriculum beginning year micro look every week time learning key variable student achievement
Instructional planning key successful classroom management
Pacing curriculum exceptional student identified learning disability able learner especially challenging today standardsbased environment
Resources provide information assistance meeting student need available Learning Disabilities Association Council Exceptional Children
Information flexible pacing technique use able gifted learner available ERIC Clearinghouse Disabilities Gifted Education
Once pacing plan place think use instructional block time allocated daily schedule
You choose several different instructional methodology structure time within instructional block myriad way
However planning successful instructional activity includes sequence event shown Figure
Plans enough material student
Duplicate material student need
For center work prepares material decides procedure center use post direction rule assignment decides student group necessary
Determines lesson objective decides motivating interactive way introduce decides product student produce due date product
Decides instructional teacher demonstration lecture discussion debate strategy
Decides direction amount time required student complete assignment

Decides strategy lesson closure
Plans give stop work cleanup warning followed warning student give full attention closure activity
Now let look way use various instructional strategy within varying timeframes
One key factor planning lesson consider attention span student
According Meeting Network average attention span audience adult Burmark
We know young child generally short attention span
To estimate number minute child attention span add two child age
So child elementary grade activity within time period vary include mix listening movement experience individual partner group work
Even though middle high school student longer attention span many student continue difficulty paying attention lecture minute
On hand child concentrate extended period time project game computer activity book intensely interested
So easy understand time management crucial successful learning experience
For learning experience time element lesson varies type activity student age
Use time choice instructional strategy also based scheduled time learning experience
However regardless length time successful lesson include entire sequence event shown Figure
Time wasted getting material supply beginning lesson set negative tone encourages behavior
Lectures seatwork assignment long group work activity short fail accomplish learning objective
A hurried ending lesson leaf student without key element important permanent learning
It also critical time teacher ass student accomplished objective student need time
The old adage Time lost never found ring especially true classroom
The following strategy help develop procedure dealing supply student work The following suggestion helpful organizing group work managing student working learning center The following suggestion help estimate long plan various type instructional strategy Effective time management one skill necessary success school well everyday life work world
Students need time practice rehearse review apply connect new learning relate everyday life
Teachers effectively manage time give student best opportunity learn develop personal habit lead wise use time
In Chapter examine way manage transition administrative task interruption
Efficient use time activity increase amount time instructional activity

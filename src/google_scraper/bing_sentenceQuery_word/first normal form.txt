In standard way presenting object
The distinction canonical normal form varies subfield
In field canonical form specifies representation every object normal form simply specifies form without requirement uniqueness
The canonical form finite sequence digit begin zero
More generally class object defined consists choice specific object class
For example canonical form canonical form one considers equivalent matrix left product
In computer science specifically representing mathematical object computer usually many different way represent object
In context representation every object unique representation
Thus equality two object easily tested testing equality canonical form
However canonical form frequently depend arbitrary choice like ordering variable introduces difficulty testing equality two object resulting independent computation
Therefore computer algebra weaker notion A representation zero uniquely represented
This allows testing equality putting difference two object normal form
also mean defined natural canonical way
In computer science data one possible representation often canonicalized completely unique representation called
Putting something canonical form
Suppose set object
A given designating object canonical form every object consideration equivalent exactly one object canonical form
In word canonical form represent equivalence class
To test whether two object equivalent suffices test canonical form equality
A canonical form thus provides classifies every class give distinguished canonical representative
Formally canonicalization respect equivalence relation set mapping Property redundant follows applying
In practical term one want able recognize canonical form
There also practical algorithmic question consider pas given object canonical form
Canonical form generally used make operating equivalence class effective
For example canonical form residue class usually taken least integer
Operations class carried combining representative reducing result least residue
The uniqueness requirement sometimes relaxed allowing form unique finer equivalence relation like allowing reordering term natural ordering term
A canonical form may simply convention deep theorem
For example polynomial conventionally written term descending power usual write although two form define polynomial
By contrast existence matrix deep theorem
Note section equivalence relation E mean canonical form unique general one object two different canonical form
In By contrast alternative form writing equation
For example equation line may written form
put Standard form used many mathematician scientist write extremely concise understandable way
In branch mathematics problem finding canonical form given graph
A canonical form Canon every graph isomorphic canonical form
Thus solution graph canonization problem one could also solve problem test whether two graph isomorphic compute canonical form Canon Canon test whether two canonical form identical
Canonical include important study
In reduction data kind canonical form commonly called
For instance process organizing minimize dependency
In field common unchecked
The mitigation problem proper
Before input validation may performed input must normalized eliminating encoding instance reducing input data single common
Other form data typically associated including normalized order provide limited range value

First normal form set fundamental rule database normalization relates single table within relational database system
Normalization follows three basic step building last
The first first normal form
The first normal form state The first step confirming modifying multivalued column make sure column table take one entry
Searching record duplicate entry complex
To overcome situation record involved relational database table identified unique value seperate column attribute
This unique key called index key used locate data retrieval manipulation
Having unique key resolve requirement
According rule multiple entry single field
For example data table customer information single field could allowed store multiple entry customer mulutiple telephone number
This violation rule
This particular problem example resolved creating customer ID index main table adding separate table column telephone number another column customer ID
This allows proper use relational query extract data relational database
Null multiple entry field cause issue data manipulation extraction normalizing process remove ambiguity
Removing repeating value table next step toward first normalized form
Repeating value moved new table
The final step implementing first normal form maintaining atomicity data
Each individual field hold smallest data element possible facilitate easy sorting searching
For instance date column separated day month year
Tables satisfying first normal form also contain functionally dependent field
Functional dependency exists two field value field determines value field one value field
In case field functionally dependent field
Tables satisfying higher normal form second third fourth necessarily follow first normal form reverse true
All table complying first normal form may follow higher normal form higher normal form include even stringent rule

simply process organizing attribute relation reduce improve
Normalization also process simplifying design database achieves optimal structure composed atomic element
It first proposed integral part
Normalization involves arranging attribute based attribute ensuring dependency properly enforced database integrity constraint
Normalization accomplished applying formal rule either process synthesis decomposition
Synthesis creates normalized database design based known set dependency
Decomposition take existing insufficiently normalized database design improves based known set dependency
Edgar Codd inventor relational model RM introduced concept normalization known
Codd went define Codd defined BCNF
Informally relational database relation often described normalized meet third normal form
Most relation free insertion update deletion anomaly
A basic objective first normal form defined Codd permit data queried manipulated using universal data grounded
example data albeit one Codd regarded seriously flawed
The objective normalization beyond first normal form stated follows Codd When attempt made modify update insert delete relation following undesirable may arise relation sufficiently normalized When fully normalized database structure extended allow accommodate new type data aspect database structure remain largely entirely unchanged
As result application interacting database minimally affected
Normalized relation relationship one normalized relation another mirror concept interrelationship
Querying manipulating data within data structure normalized following representation customer credit card transaction involves complexity really necessary To customer corresponds group transaction
The automated evaluation query relating customer transaction therefore would broadly involve two stage For example order find monetary sum transaction occurred October customer system would know must first unpack group customer sum transaction thus obtained transaction fall October
One Codd important insight structural complexity reduced leading much greater power flexibility way query could formulated evaluated
A normalized equivalent structure might look like In modified structure key Cust
ID first relation Cust
ID Tr ID second relation
Now row represents individual credit card transaction DBMS obtain answer interest simply finding row Date falling October summing Amounts
The data structure place value equal footing exposing DBMS directly potentially participate directly query whereas previous situation value embedded structure handled specially
Accordingly normalized design lends query processing whereas unnormalized design
The normalized version also allows user change customer name one place guard error arise customer name misspelled record

Database Normalization What Is Actual Definition First Normal Form
September exceptional
The normal form BCNF talk functional dependency nothing functional dependency
Moreover precise definition normal form generally accepted definition
When look various description word see often
It common say relation attribute atomic
A good theory oriented book
Date present four eminent example definition Exercise
take look
mean indivisible fact really indivisible computer science
Certainly want split attribute relation contain
So clue people mind demanding atomicity
In opinion intuition behind definition rarely need extract information value attribute
This intuition confirmed writing also us
But explains one decide depending theory whether relation
Let u look example
If need phone number call client atomic attribute
But run database phone company North America also interested splitting phone number area code central office code finally station number
So really atomic depends
And course case want decompose value usually consider atomic
Imagine want anonymize person database present initial
certainly legitimate decomposition otherwise atomic attribute
Thus opinion habitual use data make attribute atomic theory
No wonder much mess theory
If go back original definition may shed light problem
Codd writes So Codd us refers nonatomic value relation
Later state relational domain eliminated place get relation decomposed call normal form
This time normal form
Then Codd present example relation normal form
Simplifying example I describe two relation
All primary key written italic
The relation attribute domain another relation
This simple domain Codd certainly atomic
Then Codd proceeds normalization procedure
He creates separate relation remove attribute child
As see new component primary key
In description Codd mention term exactly us
In opinion original intuition simple sufficiently precise
A relation attribute relational domain
Do want relation obey definition
Well imagine need perform join attribute whose value relation
This would simple task write query would
So good reason keep relation normalized
Of course write corresponding SQL query relation case query complexity would better paired performance complexity
My bottom line follows
We would better stuck original intuition never tried explain vague notion atomicity
All data type NUMERIC TEXT DATE even BLOB taken atomic
It set relation

If working database chance heard term normalization
Perhaps someone asked Is database normalized
Is
Normalization often brushed aside luxury academic time
However knowing principle normalization applying daily database design task really complicated could drastically improve performance DBMS
In article introduce concept normalization take brief look common normal form
Normalization process efficiently organizing data database
There two goal normalization process eliminating redundant data example storing data one table ensuring make sense storing related data table
Both worthy goal reduce amount space database consumes ensure data logically stored
The database community developed series guideline ensuring database normalized
These referred normal form numbered one lowest form normalization referred first normal form five fifth normal form
In practical application often see along occasional
Fifth normal form rarely seen wo discussed article
Before begin discussion normal form important point guideline guideline
Occasionally becomes necessary stray meet practical business requirement
However variation take place extremely important evaluate possible ramification could system account possible inconsistency
That said let explore normal form
First normal form set basic rule organized database Second normal form address concept removing Third normal form go one large step The Normal Form also referred third half normal form add one requirement Finally fourth normal form one additional requirement Remember normalization guideline cumulative
For database must first fulfill criterion database
While database normalization often good idea absolute requirement
In fact case deliberately violating rule normalization good practice

First Normal Form set basic rule organized database What rule mean contemplating practical design database
It actually quite simple
The first rule dictate must duplicate data within row table
Within database community concept referred atomicity table
Tables comply rule said atomic
Let explore principle classic example table within human resource database store relationship
For purpose example impose business rule manager may one subordinate subordinate may one manager
Intuitively creating list spreadsheet track information might create table following field However recall first rule imposed Eliminate duplicative column table
Clearly column duplicative
Take moment ponder problem raised scenario
If manager one subordinate column simply wasted storage space precious database commodity
Furthermore imagine case manager already subordinate happens take another employee
The whole table structure would require modification
At point second bright idea usually occurs database novice We want one column want allow flexible amount data storage
Let try something like And Subordinates field would contain multiple entry form Mary Bill Joe
This solution closer also fall short mark
The subordinate column still duplicative
What happens need add remove subordinate
We need read write entire content table
That big deal situation one manager one hundred employee
Also complicates process selecting data database future query
Here table satisfies first rule In case subordinate single entry manager may multiple entry
Now second rule identify row unique column set column
You might take look table suggest use subordinate column primary key
In fact subordinate column good candidate primary key due fact business rule specified subordinate may one manager
However data chosen store table make le ideal solution
What happens hire another employee named Jim
How store relationship database
It best use truly unique identifier employee ID
Our final table would look like Now table first normal form
If like continue learning normalization read article series There error

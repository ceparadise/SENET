In general mean amount time taken fulfill request
The concept thus overlap contrasted cycle time
In computing turnaround time total time taken submission execution return complete output
It may vary various programming language depending developer software program
Turnaround time may simply deal total time take program provide required output user program started
Turnaround time one used evaluate operating system
In case batch system turnaround time include time taken forming batch batch execution printing result
With increasing distinction computing context context becoming semantic
An example context turnaround time time particular commercial laboratory take result
Laboratories may publish average turnaround time inform client
health care worker ordering test time result expected
A prolonged turnaround time may give requester clue specimen received analysis met problem within lab including result unusual test repeated
Lead Time amount time defined service provider required meet customer request demand
basically time gap order placed customer time get final delivery hand Turnaround Time order get job done deliver output job submitted processing center according customer request
Turnaround time amount time elapsed time submission time completion whereas average time elapsed submission till first response produced
Waiting time amount time process waiting ready queue
In case warehouse several reason due TAT increase
First labor issue labor working properly maximum efficiency could reached process would delayed
Secondly infrastructure improper infrastructure could obstacle TAT reduction

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
For following job The would using FCFS algorithm What would
You need determine time job completed
With scheduler simple calculate job start soon processor becomes free take exactly burst time complete
You already calculated start end time calculate wait time use obtain turnaround time
For example A arrives time
The processor free start time end time
Then processor run B wait unit finish time turnaround time
The answer book seems totaling completion time without regard arrival time
This something I recognize
turnaround time Completion time give average As already said Tournaround time TAT time submission completion
If look task A arrives time submission time take timeunits finish
mean TAT A let look task B arrives time wait A finish
A finish B start working finish
Now subtract arrival time minus finishing time TAT
Now C arrival time working time burst finishing Tat Now D arrival time working time burst finishing Tat Now E arrival time working time burst finishing Tat result tada
EXECUTION AROUND TIME AND THEN THE EXECUTION ADDS TO THE NEXT EXECUTION TO THE ALREADY EXISTING TIME TO SUBTRACT THE ARRIVAL TIME
THEN ADD ALL THE TURNAROUND TIME AND THE DIVIDE THERE SUM TOTAL BY THERE TOTAL NUMBER By posting answer agree

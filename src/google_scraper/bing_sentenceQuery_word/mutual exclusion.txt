A mutual exclusion mutex program object prevents simultaneous access shared resource
This concept used concurrent programming critical section piece code process thread access shared resource
Only one thread owns mutex time thus mutex unique name created program start
When thread hold resource lock mutex thread prevent concurrent access resource
Upon releasing resource thread unlocks mutex
Mutex come picture two thread work data time
It act lock basic synchronization tool
When thread try acquire mutex gain mutex available otherwise thread set sleep condition
Mutual exclusion reduces latency using queuing context switch
Mutex enforced hardware software level
Disabling interrupt smallest number instruction best way enforce mutex kernel level prevent corruption shared data structure
If multiple processor share memory flag set enable disable resource acquisition based availability
The mechanism enforces mutex software area
This furnished algorithm Dekker algorithm bakery algorithm Szymanski algorithm Peterson algorithm Lamport bakery algorithm

A mutex program object prevents simultaneous access shared resource
This concept used concurrent programming critical section piece code process thread access shared resource
Like talk cpu scheduling operating system decides process would get use cpu first
That done allocating cpu particular time interval process running parallel
So cpu busy one task process suspended state
But time usually small see process running parallel o

In mechanism enforcing limit access resource environment many
A lock designed enforce policy
Generally lock thread cooperates acquiring lock accessing corresponding data
Some system also implement attempting unauthorized access locked resource force entity attempting make access
The simplest type lock binary
It provides exclusive access locked data
Other scheme also provide shared access reading data
Other widely implemented access mode exclusive
Another way classify lock happens prevents progress thread
Most locking design requesting lock allowed access locked resource
With thread simply wait spin lock becomes available
This efficient thread blocked short time avoids overhead operating system process
It inefficient lock held long time progress thread holding lock depends preemption locked thread
Locks typically require hardware support efficient implementation
This support usually take form one instruction
These instruction allow single process test lock free free acquire lock single atomic operation
architecture option using special instruction instruction prefix disable interrupt technique work machine
Proper support lock multiprocessor environment require quite complex hardware software support substantial issue
The reason required concurrency one task executes logic
For example consider following code The example guarantee task lock since one task testing lock time
Since task detect lock free task attempt set lock knowing task also setting lock
possible substitute atomic locking operation available
Careless use lock result
A number strategy used avoid recover deadlock livelocks
The common strategy standardize lock acquisition sequence combination lock always acquired specifically defined cascade order
Some language support lock syntactically
An example follows The code lead problem instance accessed publicly
Similar C also synchronize entire method using attribute
Before introduced lock granularity one need understand three concept lock There tradeoff decreasing lock overhead decreasing lock contention choosing number lock synchronization
An important property lock
The granularity measure amount data lock protecting
In general choosing coarse granularity small number lock protecting large segment data result le single process accessing protected data worse performance multiple process running concurrently
This increased
The coarse lock higher likelihood lock stop unrelated process proceeding
Conversely using fine granularity larger number lock protecting fairly small amount data increase overhead lock reduces lock contention
Granular locking process must hold multiple lock common set lock create subtle lock dependency
This subtlety increase chance programmer unknowingly introduce
In example lock could protect order increasing granularity part field field record data page entire table
Coarse granularity using table lock tends give best performance single user whereas fine granularity record lock tends give best performance multiple user
used mean ensuring transaction synchronicity

making transaction processing concurrent interleaving transaction using ensures concurrent execution transaction turn equivalent serial ordering transaction
However deadlock become unfortunate locking database
Deadlocks either prevented locking order transaction detected using
An alternate locking database synchronicity avoiding deadlock involves use totally ordered global timestamps
There mechanism employed manage action multiple purpose prevent lost update dirty read
The two type locking resource protection synchronization many disadvantage Some strategy avoid problem
For example avoid biggest problem deadlock
Alternatives locking include method like programming technique
However alternative method often require actual lock mechanism implemented fundamental level operating software
Therefore may relieve level detail implementing lock problem listed still needing dealt beneath application
In case proper locking depends CPU providing method atomic instruction stream synchronization example addition deletion item pipeline requires contemporaneous operation needing add delete item pipe suspended manipulation memory content required add delete specific item
Therefore application often robust recognizes burden place upon operating system capable graciously recognizing reporting impossible demand
One programming biggest problem lock hard combine small correct module equally correct larger program without modifying module least knowing internals
advocate give following example banking application design class allows multiple concurrent client deposit withdraw money account give algorithm transfer money one account another
The solution first part problem The second part problem much complicated
A routine correct would In concurrent program algorithm incorrect one thread halfway another might observe state withdrawn first account yet deposited account money gone missing system
This problem fixed completely taking lock account prior changing two account lock taken according arbitrary global ordering prevent deadlock This solution get complicated lock involved function need know lock
Programming language vary support synchronization

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
Mutual Exclusion available

In computer programming program allows multiple program share resource file access simultaneously
When program started mutex created unique name
After stage thread need resource must lock mutex thread using resource
The mutex set unlock data longer needed routine finished
When spelled package typesetting system support musical notation

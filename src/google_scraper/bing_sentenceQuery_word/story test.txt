In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

taking Advanced Placement computer engineering exam ever according College Board
In largely thanks new test aimed expanding reach engineering class female participation AP test increased faster rate young boy participation exam
For woman hoping career computer engineering kind early training make difference
The field computer science growing fast outpaces
It great work get
In fact percent student take AP exam say want work computer science
Trouble mostly white Asian men land job
Experts say change got combat educating woman people color come high school college right degree enter field
Heartening number like report good step right direction
But also belie fact getting woman people color pipeline beginning
The real challenge supporting engineer enter actually hiring first place
Though increase reported woman people color taking exam celebrated fairly modest gain scheme thing
This year percent woman took AP Computer Science exam last year
Much growth however total number student took AP Computer science exam doubled whole new AP course aiming broaden reach computer science bring subject underprivileged community urban rural area
say participation black Latino student AP exam increased percent compared one year combine two group together
possible proportion black student Latino student taken separately increase faster rate took AP exam year
Seeing gain among female black Hispanic student story bring opportunity people need say Hadi Partovi CEO cofounder
Ten year ago percent computer science exam taker woman
This year figure rose lower average proportion woman employed tech industry
It young people color nearly decade proportion young POCs took AP Computer Science exam stalled percent
But percent exam taker young people went percent
I delighted hear female black Latino student taking AP computer science say Rachel Thomas deep learning researcher
I attended poor public high school Texas I incredibly lucky offering AP computer science year ago
My guidance counselor discouraged taking course I proud teenage standing ground wanting take say
The excitement new AP course show educator bring computer science people diverse people jump pool job candidate
And turn help supply industry computer science graduate address tech industry year come
The pipeline problem however far thing keeping woman minority engineering
Universities already graduate Latino black female student tech company hire
total smoke screen major tech company celebrate news continuing fail address toxic environment
Women leave technology company rate men according survey University
The trend similar people color tech
This culture problem pipeline one
Most major tech company revolving door woman people color quit similar rate hired due poor treatment lack advancement opportunity unfairness say Thomas
I think total smoke screen major tech company celebrate news continuing fail address toxic environment
Worse yet seeing improvement diversity mean trend hold
In number woman studying computer science
And yet academic year woman accounted percentage flattened dropping percent
Getting woman people color pipeline one thing say Tracy Cross professor educational psychology The College William Mary Center Gifted Education
But keeping field A recent slew sexual harassment story pouring Silicon Valley show extreme toxic field woman
But subtler way Valley alienate people
There many form disrespect devaluing demeaning isolating behavior occur male dominated field good intention ill intention unintentional say Denise Wilson professor engineering got tech degree late
The VC tech industry effort work fix culture problem drafting decency pledge blacklist public promise
With woman people color entering pipeline tech company candidate candidate must right

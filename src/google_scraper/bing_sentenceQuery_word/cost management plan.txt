You ca manage project cost thinking
You need plan document manage cost Cost Management Plan
One thing Project Managers often struggle managing project cost
This Cost Management Plan template help ensure approach methodology managing cost throughout life project
This template based cost management guideline presented fourth edition PMBOK
If like Configuration Management Plan Template sure let friend know
We like
The Cost Management Plan clearly defines cost project managed throughout project lifecycle
It set format standard project cost measured reported controlled
The Cost Management Plan The Project Manager responsible managing reporting project cost throughout duration project
During monthly project status meeting Project Manager meet management present review project cost performance preceding month
Performance measured using earned value
The Project Manager responsible accounting cost deviation presenting Project Sponsor option getting project back budget
The Project Sponsor authority make change project bring back within budget
In section Cost Management Plan explain approach cost management project
We chose create Cost Accounts fourth level WBS example since many project management office Project Management Information System
If using Project Management Information System manage cost work package level
For Project Management Information System want determine level WBS effectively manage project cost
The WBS go detailed cost management
However balance granularity want manage cost amount effort take manage level
The granular cost management work necessary manage
Costs project managed fourth level Work Breakdown Structure WBS
Control Accounts CA created level track cost
Earned Value calculation CA measure manage financial performance project
Although activity cost estimate detailed work package level accuracy cost management fourth level WBS
Credit work assigned work package level
Work started work package grant work package credit whereas remaining credited upon completion work defined work package
Costs may rounded nearest dollar work hour rounded nearest whole hour
Cost variance cost schedule performance index change status cost cautionary value changed yellow project status report
Cost variance cost schedule performance index change status cost alert stage value changed red project status report
This require corrective action Project Manager order bring cost schedule performance index alert level
Corrective action require project change request must approved Project Sponsor become within scope project
This section Cost Management Plan defines project cost measured
The PMBOK focus Earned Value Management measuring controlling project cost
Earned Value Management broad powerful tool recommend project manager take formal course Earned Value Management
In section detail measure project cost
What Earned Value measurement captured reported upon
Will use tool project management software assist capturing Earned Value metric
How forecast future project cost
Will review cost performance time across work package schedule activity
Our example section measure four Earned Value measurement Schedule Variance SV Cost Variance CV Schedule Performance Index SPI Cost Performance Index CPI
For typical project four measurement provide enough insight effective management without overburdening Project Manager Earned Value calculation measurement
Schedule Variance SV measurement schedule performance project
It calculated taking Earned Value EV subtracting Planned Value PV
Since EV actual value earned project PV value project plan say earned point subtract planned actual good measurement tell u ahead behind baseline schedule according project plan
If SV zero project perfectly schedule
If SV greater zero project earning value planned thus ahead schedule
If SV le zero project earning le value planned thus behind schedule
Cost Variance CV measurement budget performance project
CV calculated subtracting Actual Costs AC Earned Value EV
As already know EV actual value earned project
AC actual cost incurred date thus subtract actual cost EV good measurement tell u budget
If CV zero project perfectly budget
If CV greater zero project earning value planned thus budget
If CV le zero project earning le value planned thus budget
Schedule Performance Index SPI measure progress achieved planned
SPI calculated
If EV equal PV value SPI
If EV le PV value le mean project behind schedule
If EV greater PV value SPI greater one mean project ahead schedule
A well performing project SPI close possible maybe even little
Cost Performance Index CPI measure value work completed compared actual cost work completed
CPI calculated
If CPI equal project perfectly budget
If CPI greater project budget le project budget
Performance project measured using Earned Value Management
The following four Earned Value metric used measure project cost performance If Schedule Performance Index Cost Performance Index variance Project Manager must report reason exception
If SPI CPI variance greater Project Manager must report reason exception provide management detailed corrective plan bring project performance back acceptable level
Reporting cost management included monthly project status report
The Monthly Project Status Report include section labeled Cost Management
This section contain Earned Value Metrics identified previous section
All cost variance outside threshold identified Cost Management Plan reported including corrective action planned
Change Requests triggered based upon project cost overrun identified tracked report
This section Cost Management Plan defines control threshold project action taken project trigger control threshold
As part response process Project Manager typically present option corrective action Project Sponsor approve appropriate action order bring project back budget
The Project Manager may propose increase budget project reduce scope quality corrective action
The Control Thresholds project CPI SPI le greater
If project reach one Control Thresholds Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan required
The Project Manager present Project Sponsor option corrective action within five business day cost variance first reported
Within three business day Project Sponsor selects corrective action option Project Manager present Project Sponsor formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan
The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan detail action necessary bring project back within budget mean effectiveness action plan measured
Upon acceptance Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan become part project plan project updated reflect corrective action
Typically change control process follows project change control process
If special requirement cost change control process detailed section Cost Management Plan
The cost change control process follow established project change request process
Approvals project change must approved project sponsor
The budget project detailed
Costs project presented various category
Fixed Costs xxx Material Costs xxx Contractor Costs xxx Total Project Cost xxx Management Reserve x

ICT digital transformation service The discipline cost estimating cost planning well understood
There confusion whether cost estimate cost plan thing
They
And project manager technical expert might uncomfortable coming term commercial aspect profession
That understandable core competency managing designing accounting
But project manager technical expert need comfortable making cost estimate developing cost plan
So let see I help ease discomfort Here basic difference cost estimate cost plan A assessment approximation likely cost initiative indication degree accuracy usually percent
In construction industry good example project management cost estimate prediction cost construction
A determines fiscal feasibility initiative
This done setting lifecycle budget cost control manage delivery quality initiative outcome set timeframe
In construction industry cost plan used way controlling estimated cost design construction phase project
That mean cost plan living artefact like project management plan
They must managed throughout lifecycle initiative industry
The art matter science cost estimation migrates cost planning relies sound commercial principle
It requires right modelling tool good dose experience
The guiding principle cost estimating cost planning Cost estimating cost planning outcome provide framework cost control lifecycle initiative
Cost control making sure stay within budget set cost estimating cost planning process
The execution implementation guiding principle come many form permutation
Most project management knowledge chapter cost estimating cost planning need control scarce resource
Managing cost sits top project management criterion along managing scope time quality
I could argue cost managed likely three control either
So capability develop financial model dependent commercial intellect relevant industry experience
An experienced cost planner must capability visualise time cost design material effort risk apply commercial strategy present plan logical structured manner
The notion cost estimate need accurate since definition predict future fallacy
It true cost estimate rough figure
And yes basis estimate assumption constraint limitation etc
But business plan bid work without estimate
The trick ensure number strategy support number substance
The difference good estimate bad estimate result winning work winning work losing money
Here commonly named estimate I come across Obviously level detail knowledge initiative increase level tolerance required estimate decrease
As I said cost estimating cost planning requires sound commercial principle right modelling tool experience
Here four element raise chance cost estimating success To estimate well need broad understanding experience product estimating
That mean need know understand industry benchmark
For example help know industry benchmark daily rate metre cable GST
You need understanding different estimating technique
Guide developed Project Management Institute explains technique bottom top plus minus tolerance
Your expertise knowledge use right technique contributes estimate accuracy
A good Excel workbook number trap macro serve well
There estimating program although suited construction industry
Using right tool add accuracy estimate
These essential element ensure estimate checked meet industry standard fit business expectation
Cost review contribute accuracy cost estimate
Successful cost planning made diversified choice approach execution
There one approach fit scenario
It case making best appropriate choice fit situation
Before developing cost plan initiative need consider framework
And lot consider covered article
Here decision need made order determine best approach cost plan deliver desired outcome accuracy As I said lot consider
But effective cost planning depends decision regarding matter
The success formula repeatable execution quality cost estimate cost plan combination experience commercial intellect choice optimal tool approach
Cost estimating cost planning art science
But importantly require strong dose structure discipline
And never underestimate experience brings table
Karl well respected ICT industry integrity drive commitment client relationship management excellent project management skill experience
He designed managed implementation voice data network financial dealing system contact centre data centre associated physical infrastructure specialises developing strategy business case cost plan

The management construction project requires knowledge modern management well understanding design construction process
Construction project specific set objective constraint required time frame completion
While relevant technology institutional arrangement process differ management project much common management similar type project specialty technology domain aerospace pharmaceutical energy development
Generally project management distinguished general management corporation nature project
A project organization generally terminated mission accomplished
According Project Management Institute discipline project management defined follows Project management art directing coordinating human material resource throughout life project using modern management technique achieve predetermined objective scope cost time quality participation satisfaction
By contrast general management business industrial corporation assumes broader outlook greater continuity operation
Nevertheless sufficient similarity well difference two modern management technique developed general management may adapted project management
The basic ingredient project management framework may represented schematically Figure
A working knowledge general management familiarity special knowledge domain related project indispensable
Supporting discipline computer science decision science may also play important role
In fact modern management practice various special knowledge domain absorbed various technique tool identified supporting discipline
For example information system decision support system tool general management
Similarly many operation research technique linear programming network analysis widely used many knowledge application domain
Hence representation Figure reflects source project management framework evolves
Specifically project management construction encompasses set objective may accomplished implementing series operation subject resource constraint
There potential conflict stated objective regard scope cost time quality constraint imposed human material financial resource
These conflict resolved onset project making necessary tradeoff creating new alternative
Subsequently function project management construction generally include following In recent year major development management reflect acceptance various degree following element management process approach management science decision support approach behavioral science approach human resource development sustainable competitive advantage
These four approach complement current practice provide useful groundwork project management
The management process approach emphasizes systematic study management identifying management function organization examining detail
There general agreement regarding function planning organizing controlling
A major tenet analyzing management along functional line framework constructed new management activity placed
Thus manager job regarded coordinating process interrelated function neither totally random rigidly predetermined dynamic process evolves
Another tenet management principle derived intellectual analysis management function
By dividing manager job functional component principle based upon function extracted
Hence management function organized hierarchical structure designed improve operational efficiency example organization manufacturing company shown Figure
The basic management function performed manager regardless enterprise activity hierarchical level
Finally development management philosophy result helping manager establish relationship human material resource
The outcome following established philosophy operation help manager win support subordinate achieving organizational objective
The management science decision support approach contributes development body quantitative method designed aid manager making complex decision related operation production
In decision support system emphasis placed providing manager relevant information
In management science great deal attention given defining objective constraint constructing mathematical analysis model solving complex problem inventory material production control among others
A topic major interest management science maximization profit absence workable model operation entire system suboptimization operation component
The optimization suboptimization often achieved use operation research technique linear programming quadratic programming graph theory queuing theory Monte Carlo simulation
In addition increasing use computer accompanied development sophisticated mathematical model information system management science decision support system played important role looking carefully problem input relationship promoting goal formulation measurement performance
Artificial intelligence also begun applied provide decision support system solving problem management
The behavioral science approach human resource development important management entail getting thing done action people
An effective manager must understand importance human factor need drive motivation leadership personality behavior work group
Within context place emphasis interpersonal behavior focus individual motivation others emphasize group behavior recognition organized enterprise social organism subject attitude habit pressure conflict cultural environment people
The major contribution made behavioral scientist field management include formulation concept explanation individual group behavior organization empirical testing concept methodically many different experimental field setting establishment actual managerial policy decision operation based conceptual methodical framework
Sustainable competitive advantage stem primarily good management strategy
As Michael Porter Harvard Business School argues The programming capital project shaped strategic plan organization influenced market demand resource constraint
The programming process associated planning feasibility study set priority timing initiating various project meet overall objective organization
However decision made initiate project market pressure may dictate early timely completion facility
Among various type construction influence market pressure timing initiating facility obvious industrial construction
Demand industrial product may company hit market first may demand product later
With intensive competition national international market trend industrial construction move toward shorter project life cycle particularly technology intensive industry
In order gain time owner willing forego thorough planning feasibility study proceed project inadequate definition project scope
Invariably subsequent change project scope increase construction cost however profit derived earlier facility operation often justify increase construction cost
Generally owner derive reasonable profit operation completed facility project considered success even construction cost far exceed estimate based inadequate scope definition
This attitude may attributed large part uncertainty inherent construction project
It difficult argue profit might even higher construction cost could reduced without increasing project duration
However project notably nuclear power plant clearly unsuccessful abandoned completion demise must attributed least part inadequate planning poor feasibility study
The owner facility sponsor hold key influence construction cost project decision made beginning stage project life cycle far greater influence made later stage shown schematically Figure
Moreover design construction decision influence continuing operating cost many case revenue facility lifetime
Therefore owner obtain expertise professional provide adequate planning feasibility study
Many owner maintain engineering construction management capability consider establishment ongoing relationship outside consultant order respond quickly request
Even among owner maintain engineering construction division many treat division reimbursable independent organization
Such arrangement discourage legitimate use false economy reimbursable cost division indeed costly overall organization
Finally initiation execution capital project place demand resource owner professional contractor engaged owner
For large project may bid price engineering service well cost material equipment contract price type
Consequently factor taken consideration determining timing project
A department store planned expand operation acquiring acre land southeast metropolitan area consists well established suburb middle income family
An firm engaged design shopping center plot department store flagship plus large number storefront tenant
One year later department store owner purchased acre farm land northwest outskirt metropolitan area designated acre land shopping center
The firm engaged design shopping center new location
The firm kept completely dark assemblage acre land northwest quietly took place
When plan specification southeast shopping center completed owner informed firm would proceed construction southeast shopping center time
Instead owner urged firm produce new set similar plan specification northwest shopping center soon possible even sacrifice cost saving measure
When plan specification northwest shopping center ready owner immediately authorized construction
However took another three year southeast shopping center finally built
The reason behind change plan owner discovered availability farm land northwest could developed residential real estate property upper middle income family
The immediate construction northwest shopping center would make land development parcel attractive home buyer
Thus owner able recoup enough cash flow three year construct southeast shopping center addition financing construction northeast shopping center well land development vicinity
While owner want construction cost northwest shopping center run wild apparently satisfied cost estimate based detailed plan southeast shopping center
Thus owner general idea construction cost northwest shopping center would wish wait refined cost estimate detailed plan center ready
To owner timeliness completing construction northwest shopping center far important reducing construction cost fulfilling investment objective
A major problem mega project severe strain placed environment particularly resource immediate area construction project
Mega macro project involve construction large facility Alaska pipeline constructed Panama Canal constructed
The limitation basic element required successful completion mega project include To compound problem mega project often constructed remote environment away major population center subject severe climate condition
Consequently special feature mega project must evaluated carefully
The uncertainty undertaking construction project come many source often involves many participant project
Since participant try minimize risk conflict among various participant detrimental project
Only owner power moderate conflict alone hold key risk assignment proper contractual relation participant
Failure recognize responsibility owner often lead undesirable result
In recent year concept risk assignment contract gained acceptance federal government
Since type contract acknowledges responsibility owner contract price expected lower risk assigned contractor
In approaching problem uncertainty important recognize incentive must provided participant expected take greater risk
The willingness participant accept risk often reflects professional competence participant well propensity risk
However society perception potential liability participant affect attitude participant
When claim made one participant difficult public know whether fraud committed simply accident occurred
Risks construction project may classified number way
One form classification follows The environmental protection movement contributed uncertainty construction inability know required long take obtain approval regulatory agency
The requirement continued problem lack definitive criterion practical also resulted added cost
Public safety regulation similar effect noticeable energy field involving nuclear power plant coal mining
The situation created constantly shifting guideline engineer constructor owner project move stage planning construction
These moving target add significant new dimension uncertainty make virtually impossible schedule complete work budgeted cost
Economic condition past decade reinforced climate uncertainty high inflation interest rate
The deregulation financial institution also generated unanticipated problem related financing construction
Uncertainty stemming regulatory agency environmental issue financial aspect construction least mitigated ideally eliminated
Owners keenly interested achieving form breakthrough lower cost project mitigate eliminate lengthy delay
Such breakthrough seldom planned
Generally happen right condition exist innovation permitted basis incentive reward exists
However long way go true partnership party involved forged
During period economic expansion major capital expenditure made industry bid cost construction
In order control cost owner attempt use fixed price contract risk unforeseen contingency related overheated economy passed contractor
However contractor raise price compensate additional risk
The risk related organizational relationship may appear unnecessary quite real
Strained relationship may develop various organization involved process
When problem occur discussion often center responsibility rather project need time focus solving problem
Cooperation communication party discouraged fear effect impending litigation
This barrier communication result notion uncertainty resulting technological problem eliminated appropriate contract term
The net result increase cost constructed facility
The risk related technological problem familiar profession degree control category
However rapid advance new technology present new problem designer constructor technological risk become greater many instance
Certain design assumption served profession well past may become obsolete dealing new type facility may greater complexity scale
Site condition particularly subsurface condition always present degree uncertainty create even greater degree uncertainty facility heretofore unknown characteristic operation
Because construction procedure may fully anticipated design may modified construction begun
An example facility encountered uncertainty nuclear power plant many owner designer contractor suffered undertaking project
If problem cited cause uncertainty combination problem often regarded party control inherently risky
Thus issue liability taken major proportion influenced practice engineer constructor turn influenced action owner
Many owner begun understand problem risk seeking address problem
For example owner turning organization offer complete capability planning design construction tend avoid breaking project major component undertaken individually specialty participant
Proper coordination throughout project duration good organizational communication avoid delay cost resulting fragmentation service even though component various service eventually integrated
Attitudes cooperation readily applied private sector special circumstance applied public sector
The ability deal complex issue often precluded competitive bidding usually required public sector
The situation becomes difficult proliferation regulatory requirement resulting delay design construction awaiting approval government official participate risk project
The top management owner set overall policy selects appropriate organization take charge proposed project
Its policy dictate project life cycle divided among organization professional engaged
Decisions top management owner also influence organization adopted project management
In general many way decompose project stage
The typical way It pointed decomposition may work better others depending circumstance
In case prevalence decomposition make subsequent integration particularly important
The critical issue involved organization project management There two basic approach organize project implementation even though many variation may exist result different contractual relationship adopted owner builder
These basic approach divided along following line Since construction project may managed spectrum participant variety combination organization management project may vary case case
On one extreme project may staffed existing personnel functional division organization basis shown Figure project completed
This arrangement referred matrix organization project manager must negotiate resource project existing organizational framework
On hand organization may consist small central functional staff exclusive purpose supporting various project functional division shown Figure
This decentralized referred project oriented organization project manager autonomy managing project
There many variation management style two extreme depending objective organization nature construction project
For example large chemical company staff planning design construction facility new product line naturally adopt matrix organization
On hand construction company whose existence depends entirely management certain type construction project may find organization particularly attractive
While organization may differ basic principle management structure applicable situation
To illustrate various type organization project management shall consider two example first one representing owner organization second one representing organization construction management consultant direct supervision owner
The Engineering Division Electric Power Light Company functional department shown Figure
When small scale project addition transmission tower authorized matrix organization used carry project
For example design transmission tower professional skill structural engineer important
Consequently leader project team selected Structural Engineering Department remaining team member selected department dictated manpower requirement
On hand design new professional skill electrical engineer important
Hence leader project team selected Electrical Engineering Department
When Electric Power Light Company previous example decided build new nuclear power plant engaged construction management consultant take charge design construction completely
However company also assigned project team coordinate construction management consultant shown Figure
Since company eventually operate power plant upon completion highly important staff monitor design construction plant
Such coordination allows owner assure quality construction also familiar design facilitate future operation maintenance
Note close direct relationship various department owner consultant
Since project last many year completion staff member assigned project team expected rejoin Engineering Department probably involved future operation new plant
Thus project team act independently toward designated mission
For ordinary project moderate size complexity owner often employ designer firm prepares detailed plan specification constructor general contractor
The designer also act behalf owner oversee project implementation construction
The general contractor responsible construction even though work may actually undertaken number specialty subcontractor
The owner usually negotiates fee service firm
In addition responsibility designing facility firm also exercise degree supervision construction stipulated owner
Traditionally firm regard design professional representing owner communicate potential contractor avoid collusion conflict interest
Field inspector working firm usually follow implementation project design completed seldom extensive input design
Because litigation climate last two decade firm provide observer rather inspector field
Even shop drawing fabrication construction scheme submitted contractor approval reviewed disclaimer responsibility firm
The owner may select general constructor either competitive bidding negotiation
Public agency required use competitive bidding mode private organization may choose either mode operation
In using competitive bidding owner forced use sequence since detailed plan specification must ready inviting bidder submit bid
If owner chooses use negotiated contract free use phased construction desire
The general contractor may choose perform part construction work act manager subcontracting construction subcontractor
The general contractor may also select subcontractor competitive bidding negotiated contract
The general contractor may ask number subcontractor quote price subcontract submitting bid owner
However subcontractor often force winning general contractor use project
This situation may lead practice known
Bid shopping refers situation general contractor approach subcontractor whose quoted price used winning contract order seek lower priced subcontract
Bid peddling refers action subcontractor offer lower priced subcontract winning general subcontractor order dislodge subcontractor originally quoted price general contractor prior bid submittal
In case quality construction may sacrificed state statute forbid practice public project
Although sequence still widely used public perception fairness competitive bidding many private owner recognize disadvantage using approach project large complex market pressure require shorter project duration accomplished using traditional method
Professional construction management refers project management team consisting professional construction manager participant carry task project planning design construction integrated manner
Contractual relationship among member team intended minimize adversarial relationship contribute greater response within management group
A professional construction manager firm specialized practice professional construction management includes Professional construction management usually used project large complex
The organizational feature characteristic summarized follows Consequently important recognize changing nature organizational structure project carried various stage
The Alaska Pipeline Project largest expensive private construction project encompassed mile thousand employee billion dollar
At planning stage owner consortium employed Construction Management Contractor CMC direct pipeline portion retained centralized decision making assure single direction integrate effort CMC pump station terminal performed another contractor
The CMC also centralized decision making directing subcontractor thousand vendor
Because different construction camp hundred different construction site centralization caused delay decision making
At point physical completion owner decided reorganize decision making process change role CMC
The new organization combination owner CMC personnel assigned within integrated organization
The objective develop single project team responsible controlling subcontractor
Instead nine tier organization General Manager CMC subcontractor new organization four tier Senior Project Manager owner subcontractor
Besides unified direction coordination reduction tier organization greatly improved communication ability make implement decision
The new organization also allowed decentralization decision making treating five section pipeline different geographic location separate project section manager responsible function section profit center
At point physical completion remaining activity consolidated identify single responsibility reduce duplication management staff unify coordination remaining work
Thus project first handled separate organization later run integrated organization decentralized profit center
Finally organization effect became small ready phased operation
The underground railroad tunnel Britain France commonly called Channel Tunnel Chunnel
It built tunneling side
Starting tunnel breakthough
Management turmoil dogged project start
In seven eight top people construction organization left
There built conflict contractor government overseer The fundamental thing wrong constractors le Eurotunnel
Their interest build sell project profit
Eurotunnel interest operate economically safely reliably next year
Alastair Morton Eurotunnel CEO quoted ENR
In approach owner must steady flow project order maintain large work force operation
However owner may choose subcontract substantial portion project outside consultant contractor design construction even though retains centralized decision making integrate effort project implementation
The District Engineer Office Army Corps Engineers may viewed typical example approach shown Figure
In District Engineer Office
Corps Engineers usually exist Engineering Division Operations Division large district Construction Division
Under division several branch
Since authorization project usually initiated Congress planning design function separated order facilitate operation
Since authorization feasibility study project may precede authorization design many year stage best handled different branch Engineering Division
If construction ultimately authorized work may handled Construction Division outside contractor
The Operations Division handle operation lock facility require routine attention maintenance
When project authorized project manager selected appropriate branch head project together group staff drawn various branch form project team
When project completed member team including project manager return regular post various branch division next project assignment
Thus matrix organization used managing project
Some owner wish delegate responsibility design construction outside consultant project arrangement
A contractor agrees provide completed facility basis performance specification set forth owner
The contractor may even assume responsibility operating project owner desire
In order turnkey operation succeed owner must able provide set unambiguous performance specification contractor must complete confidence capability contractor carry mission
This approach direct opposite approach owner wish retain maximum amount control process
A power plant proposed Mexico Power Company Fort Worth Texas would make use turnkey operation
Upon approval Texas Utility Commission consortium consisting
Zachry Westinghouse Electric Combustion Engineering would design build finance power plant completion estimated construction cost million dollar
The consortium would assume total liability construction including debt service cost thereby eliminate risk cost escalation rate payer stockholder utility company management
The project manager broadest sense term important person success failure project
The project manager responsible planning organizing controlling project
In turn project manager receives authority management organization mobilize necessary resource complete project
The project manager must able exert interpersonal influence order lead project team
The project manager often gain support team combination following In matrix organization member functional department may accustomed single reporting line hierarchical structure project manager coordinate activity team member drawn functional department
The functional structure within matrix organization responsible priority coordination administration final decision pertaining project implementation
Thus potential conflict functional division project team
The project manager must given responsibility authority resolve various conflict established project policy quality standard jeopardized
When contending issue fundamental nature developed must brought attention high level management resolved expeditiously
In general project manager authority must clearly documented well defined particularly matrix organization functional division manager often retain certain authority personnel temporarily assigned project
The following principle observed While successful project manager must good leader member project team must also learn work together whether assembled different division organization even different organization
Some problem interaction may arise initially team member unfamiliar role project team particularly large complex project
These problem must resolved quickly order develop effective functioning team
Many major issue construction project require effective intervention individual group organization
The fundamental challenge enhance communication among individual group organization obstacle way improving interpersonal relation may removed
Some behavior science concept helpful overcoming communication difficulty block cooperation coordination
In large project professional behavior scientist may necessary diagnosing problem advising personnel working project
The power organization used judiciously resolving conflict
The major symptom interpersonal behavior problem detected experienced observer often source serious communication difficulty among participant project
For example member project team may avoid withdraw active interaction difference need dealt
They may attempt criticize blame individual group thing go wrong
They may resent suggestion improvement become defensive minimize culpability rather take initiative maximize achievement
All action detrimental project organization
While symptom occur individual organization compounded project team consists individual put together different organization
Invariably different organization different culture mode operation
Individuals different group may common loyalty may prefer expand energy direction advantageous instead project team
Therefore one take granted project team work together harmoniously member placed physically together one location
On contrary must assumed good communication achieved deliberate effort top management organization contributing joint venture
Although owner contractor may different perception project management construction common interest creating environment leading successful project performance quality completion time final cost within prescribed limit tolerance
It interesting therefore note opinion leading contractor owner interviewed
From response six contractor key factor cited successful project Conversely key factor cited unsuccessful project The response eight owner indicated always understand concern contractor although generally agreed key factor successful unsuccessful project cited contractor
The significant finding interview owner summarized follows From result interview obvious owner must aware involved process order generate favorable condition successful project
Design professional construction contractor must provide better communication owner project implementation

Weeds must kept check proactive integrated weed management approach

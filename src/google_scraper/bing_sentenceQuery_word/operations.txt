British usage discipline deal application advanced analytical method help make better decision
Further term analysis used British British Commonwealth military intrinsic part capability development management assurance
In particular operational analysis form part Combined Operational Effectiveness Investment Appraisals COEIA support British defence capability acquisition
It often considered
The term sometimes used synonym
Employing technique mathematical science operation research arrives optimal solution complex problem
Because emphasis interaction focus practical application operation research overlap discipline notably draw
Operations research often concerned determining profit performance yield minimum loss risk cost objective
Originating military effort World War II technique grown concern problem variety industry
Operational research OR encompasses wide range technique method applied pursuit improved efficiency model
Nearly technique involve construction mathematical model attempt describe system
Because computational statistical nature field OR also strong tie
Operational researcher faced new problem must determine technique appropriate given nature system goal improvement constraint time computing power
The major subdisciplines modern operational research identified journal As discipline operational research originated effort military planner World War I convoy theory
In decade two world war technique widely applied problem business industry society
Since time operational research expanded field widely used industry ranging petrochemical airline finance logistics government moving focus development mathematical model used analyse optimize complex system become area active academic industrial research
Early work operational research carried individual
His research cost transportation sorting mail led England study dynamical behaviour railway vehicle defence broad gauge
brought operational research bear problem physic would later attempt extend social science
Modern operational research originated UK result initiative station superintendent
Rowe conceived idea mean analyse improve working UK system CH
Initially analysed operating radar equipment communication network expanding later include operating personnel behaviour
This revealed unappreciated limitation CH network allowed remedial action taken
Scientists United Kingdom including later Lord Blackett OM PRS later Baron Zuckerman OM KCB FRS United States looked way make better decision area training schedule The modern field operational research arose World War II
In World War II era operational research defined scientific method providing executive department quantitative basis decision regarding operation control
Other name included operational analysis UK Ministry Defence quantitative management
During close men woman Britain engaged operational research
About operational research scientist worked
worked several different organization war
Early war working RAE set team known Circus helped reduce number round needed shoot enemy aircraft average start
In Blackett moved RAE Navy first working early
Blackett team Coastal Command Operational Research Section included two future winner many people went field
They undertook number crucial analysis aided war effort
Britain introduced system reduce shipping loss principle using warship accompany merchant ship generally accepted unclear whether better convoy small large
Convoys travel speed slowest member small convoy travel faster
It also argued small convoy would harder German detect
On hand large convoy could deploy warship attacker
Blackett staff showed loss suffered convoy depended largely number escort vessel present rather size convoy
Their conclusion large convoy defensible many small one
While performing analysis method used hunt destroy submarine one analyst asked colour aircraft
As Bomber Command painted black operation
At suggestion test run see best colour camouflage aircraft daytime operation grey North Atlantic sky
Tests showed aircraft painted white average spotted closer painted black
This change indicated submarine would attacked sunk number sighting
As result finding Coastal Command changed aircraft using white undersurface
Other work indicated average trigger depth DCs changed foot foot kill ratio would go
The reason saw aircraft shortly arrived target foot charge would damage would time descend far foot saw aircraft long way target time alter course water chance within kill zone charge small
It efficient attack submarine close surface target location better known attempt destruction greater depth position could guessed
Before change setting foot foot submerged sunk damaged
After change sunk damaged
If submarine caught surface even attacked shortly submerging number rose sunk damaged
Blackett observed case great operational gain obtained small simple change tactic
Bomber Command Operational Research Section analysed report survey carried
For survey Bomber Command inspected bomber returning bombing raid Germany particular period
All damage inflicted German noted recommendation given armour added heavily damaged area
This recommendation adopted fact aircraft returned area damaged indicated area vital adding armour area damage acceptable negatively affect aircraft performance
Their suggestion remove crew aircraft loss would result fewer personnel loss also rejected RAF command
Blackett team made logical recommendation armour placed area completely untouched damage bomber returned
They reasoned survey biased since included aircraft returned Britain
The untouched area returning aircraft probably vital area hit would result loss aircraft
When Germany organised air defence realised British RAF bomber fly could overwhelm night fighter flew individual cell directed target ground controller
It matter calculating statistical loss collision statistical loss night fighter calculate close bomber fly minimise RAF loss
The exchange rate ratio output input characteristic feature operational research
By comparing number flying hour put Allied aircraft number sighting given area possible redistribute aircraft productive patrol area
Comparison exchange rate established effectiveness ratio useful planning
The ratio laid per ship sunk common several campaign German mine British port British mine German route United States mine Japanese route
Operational research doubled bomb rate bombing Japan increasing training ratio percent flying hour revealed three United States submarine effective number enable member pack engage target discovered individual patrol station revealed glossy enamel paint effective camouflage night fighter traditional dull camouflage paint finish smooth paint finish increased airspeed reducing skin friction
On land operational research section Army Operational Research Group AORG MoS landed followed British force advance across Europe
They analysed among topic effectiveness artillery aerial bombing shooting
With expanded technique growing awareness field close war operational research longer limited operational extended encompass equipment procurement training logistics infrastructure
Operations Research also grew many area military scientist learned apply principle civilian sector
With development development computer next three decade Operations Research solve problem hundred thousand variable constraint
Moreover large volume data required problem stored manipulated efficiently
Operational research also used extensively government used
In characterized field management science business use operation research
However modern time term management science may also used refer separate field
Like operational research management science MS interdisciplinary branch applied mathematics devoted optimal decision planning strong link economics business engineering
It us various principle including statistic improve organization ability enact rational meaningful management decision arriving optimal near optimal solution complex decision problem
In short management scientist help business achieve goal using scientific method operational research
The management scientist mandate use rational systematic technique inform improve decision kind
Of course technique management science restricted business application may applied military medical public administration charitable group political group community group
Management science concerned developing applying may prove useful helping illuminate management issue solve managerial problem well designing developing new better model organizational excellence
The application model within corporate sector became known management science
Some field considerable overlap Operations Research Management Science include Applications abundant airline manufacturing company military branch government
The range problem issue contributed insight solution vast
It includes Management also concerned analysis concern method strategic
In dealing sort challenge mathematical may appropriate may suffice
Therefore past year number modeling method developed

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

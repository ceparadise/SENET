A goal challenge pursued computer scientist practitioner distributed system however goal fallen favour industry distributed system different conventional system difference partial system failure partial upgrade simply papered attempt transparency see
also refers use distributed system solve computational problem
In problem divided many task solved one computer communicate message passing
The word term distributed system distributed programming originally referred computer network individual computer physically distributed within geographical area
The term nowadays used much wider sense even referring autonomous run physical computer interact message passing
While single definition distributed system following defining property commonly used A distributed system may common goal solving large computational problem user perceives collection autonomous processor unit
Alternatively computer may user individual need purpose distributed system coordinate use shared resource provide communication service user
Other typical property distributed system include following Distributed system group networked computer goal work
The term distributed computing lot overlap clear distinction exists
The system may characterized parallel distributed processor typical distributed system run concurrently parallel
Parallel computing may seen particular tightly coupled form distributed computing distributed computing may seen loosely coupled form parallel computing
Nevertheless possible roughly classify concurrent system parallel distributed using following criterion The figure right illustrates difference distributed parallel system

The first conference field PODC date back European counterpart DISC first held
Various hardware software architecture used distributed computing
At lower level necessary interconnect multiple CPUs sort network regardless whether network printed onto circuit board made loosely coupled device cable
At higher level necessary interconnect running CPUs sort
Distributed programming typically fall one several basic architecture category
Another basic aspect distributed computing architecture method communicating coordinating work among concurrent process
Through various message passing protocol process may communicate directly one another typically relationship
Alternatively enable distributed computing done without form direct utilizing shared
Reasons using distributed system distributed computing may include Examples distributed system application distributed computing include following Many task would like automate using computer type would like ask question computer produce answer
In task called
Formally computational problem consists together instance
Instances question ask solution desired answer question
Theoretical computer science seek understand computational problem solved using computer efficiently
Traditionally said problem solved using computer design produce correct solution given instance
Such algorithm implemented run computer program read problem instance performs computation produce solution
Formalisms used abstract model sequential computer executing algorithm
The field concurrent distributed computing study similar question case either multiple computer computer executes network interacting process computational problem solved network efficiently
However obvious meant solving problem case concurrent distributed system example task algorithm designer concurrent distributed equivalent sequential computer
The discussion focus case multiple computer although many issue concurrent process running single computer
Three viewpoint commonly used In case distributed algorithm computational problem typically related graph
Often graph describes structure computer network problem instance
This illustrated following example
Consider computational problem finding coloring given graph
Different field might take following approach While field parallel algorithm different focus field distributed algorithm lot interaction two field
For example graph coloring originally presented parallel algorithm technique also used directly distributed algorithm
Moreover parallel algorithm implemented either parallel system using shared memory distributed system using message passing
The traditional boundary parallel distributed algorithm choose suitable network run given network lie place boundary parallel distributed system shared memory message passing
In parallel algorithm yet another resource addition time space number computer
Indeed often running time number computer problem solved faster computer running parallel see
If decision problem solved using polynomial number processor problem said class
The class NC defined equally well using PRAM formalism Boolean machine simulate Boolean circuit efficiently vice versa
In analysis distributed algorithm attention usually paid communication operation computational step
Perhaps simplest model distributed computing synchronous system node operate lockstep fashion
During node parallel receive latest message neighbour perform arbitrary local computation send new message neighbor
In system central complexity measure number synchronous communication round required complete task
This complexity measure closely related network
Let diameter network
On one hand computable problem solved trivially synchronous distributed system approximately communication round simply gather information one location round solve problem inform node solution round
On hand running time algorithm much smaller communication round node network must produce output without possibility obtain information distant part network
In word node must make globally consistent decision based information available
Many distributed algorithm known running time much smaller round understanding problem solved algorithm one central research question field
Other commonly used measure total number bit transmitted network cf

Traditional computational problem take perspective ask question computer distributed system process question produce answer stop

Before task begun network node either unaware node serve coordinator leader task unable communicate current coordinator
After coordinator election algorithm run however node throughout network recognizes particular unique node task coordinator
The network node communicate among order decide get coordinator state
For need method order break symmetry among
For example node unique comparable identity node compare identity decide node highest identity coordinator
The definition problem often attributed LeLann formalized method create new token token token lost
Coordinator election algorithm designed economical term total transmitted time
The algorithm suggested Gallager Humblet Spira general undirected graph strong impact design distributed algorithm general influential paper distributed computing
Many algorithm suggested different kind network undirected ring unidirectional ring complete graph grid directed Euler graph others
A general method decouples issue graph family design coordinator election algorithm suggested Korach Kutten Moran
In order perform coordination distributed system employ concept coordinator
The coordinator election problem choose process among group process different processor distributed system act central coordinator
Several central coordinator election algorithm exist
So far focus distributed system solves given problem
A complementary research problem property given distributed system
The analogous example field centralised computation given computer program task decide whether halt run forever
The halting problem general case naturally understanding behaviour computer network least hard understanding behaviour one computer

Distributed data processing technique
Images Distributed data processing method multiple computer across different location share capability
This contrast single centralized server managing providing processing capability connected system
Computers comprise distributed network located different location interconnected mean wireless satellite link
Larger organization invest expensive mainframe supercomputer function centralized server
Each mainframe machine example cost several hundred thousand dollar versus several thousand dollar minicomputer according University New Mexico
Distributed data processing considerably lower cost data sharing networking across organization comprising several minicomputer cost significantly le mainframe machine
Hardware glitch software anomaly cause processing malfunction fail resulting complete system breakdown
Distributed data processing reliable since multiple control center spread across different machine
A glitch one machine impact network since another machine take processing capability
Faulty machine quickly isolated repaired
This make distributed data processing reliable processing system
Single computer limited performance efficiency
An easy way increase performance adding another computer network
Adding yet another computer augment performance
Distributed data processing work principle hold job get done faster multiple machine handling parallel synchronously
Complicated statistical problem example broken module allocated different machine processed simultaneously
This significantly reduces processing time improves performance
Individual computer comprise distributed network present different geographical location
For example network comprising three computer machine different branch
The three machine interconnected via Internet able process data parallel even different location
This make distributed network flexible
The system flexible also term increasing decreasing processing power
For example adding node computer network increase processing power overall system capability reducing computer network decrease processing power

Finally control distributed
The control execution various task might distributed instead performed one computer system
view distributed instead system mode distribution necessary important
Distributed computing system classified respect number criterion
Some criterion follows degree coupling interconnection structure interdependence component synchronization component
Degree coupling refer measure determines closely processing element connected together
This measured ratio amount data exchanged amount local processing performed executing task
If communication done computer network exit weak coupling among processing element
However component shared talk strong coupling
shared component primary memory secondary storage device
As interconnection structure one talk case point point interconnection channel processing element might depend quite strongly execution task interdependence might minimal passing message beginning execution reporting result end
Synchronization processing element might maintained synchronous asynchronous mean
Note criterion entirely independent like processing element strongly interdependent possibly work strongly coupled fashion
The fundamental reason behind distributed processing better able solve big complicated problem using variation approach two fundamental advantage economics standpoint distributed computing provides economical method harnessing computer power employing multiple processing element optimally require research distributed processing defined earlier well parallel processing second economic reason attacking problem discipline cost software development well known cost software increasing opposition cost trend hardware

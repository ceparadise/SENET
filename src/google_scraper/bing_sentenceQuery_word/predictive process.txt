Service management aim improving customer satisfaction providing value customer reducing high service cost
Managing customer expectation right order fulfilled providing continuous support accommodating demand uncertainty impact profit
The implementation service management component application requires integration number activity across different organization
In general optimization service management component depends effective management underlying business process
Thus business process management discipline improve ability organization manage service component
Services often implemented activity business process
Customer service request instantiate business process flow
The activity business process associated service request may include different aspect service management checking legislative customer compliance requirement contacting supplier tracking inventory building assembling product communication customer supplier etc
Increasing customer satisfaction reducing service management cost depend effectively underlying business process managed
Business process management BPM promotes process essential organizational asset deliver value added service customer
BPM includes concept method technique support design administration configuration enactment analysis business process
In respect BPM considered critical ensure quality service maintaining regulatory compliance
As part improving service quality predictive analytics play important role life cycle business process management
Accurate prediction business process evolves help managing customer relation increase customer satisfaction
After process start reducing uncertainty future increase ability proactive possible outcome

Predictive analytics constitute important part service analytics
In chapter utilize BPM concept extend apply technique extract insight process behavior execution trace
Traditional BPM discipline focus controlling improving business activity
Our approach better management business activity use technique predict process outcome
The technique presented chapter expected reduce service management cost increase customer satisfaction underlying business process improved
It reduces service cost becomes possible foresee avoid potential costly failure
It also increase customer satisfaction customer informed time status service request excessive delay avoided introducing new resource process
In structured business process activity performed controlled software based process specific execution rule
Therefore business process sequence activity deterministic
Thus uncertainty managing service component relatively low
process hand depart traditional kind structured sequential predefined process
In process set activity need performed order whether additional step required determined human judgment addition available document content
This often case communication service provider actor external business process management platform done band telephone call email face face conversation
The external actor business process may include supplier legal department consultant police officer company etc
Such band unstructured communication may introduce uncertainty flow business process thus impact quality service management fulfilling customer expectation

Is Predictive Science accurately represented term Data Science
As matter fact Data Science constituent science umbrella term
This post discus point high level
We talk nutrition science focus eat
We talk exercise science focusing calorie
Or talk holistically outcome I would argue deal issue greater importance people ultimately care health science
Given argument outcome health science generally interesting raw material nutrition process turning raw material something useful exercise tend speak data science opposed predictive science
To clear data science much prediction classification
It includes machine learning technique clustering frequent itemset mining
It also includes data visualization data storytelling
It also encompass various aspect traditional like The KDD Process including data selection preprocessing transformation
Data science also include algorithm approach task beyond I mentioned
I previously follows Data science multifaceted discipline encompasses machine learning analytic process statistic related branch mathematics increasingly borrows high performance scientific computing order ultimately extract insight data use information tell story
When considering predictive science data science slender related section data science I measuring
In fact disassembly data science constituent science clustering science example would certainly help express exactly obvious expense sexy umbrella buzzword
But taking step back inarguable data input raw material
In sense data science place emphasis predictive process
While data prime ingredient predictive puzzle possibly difficult procure otherwise come across data science seems neglect major component well interesting insight
transformative process
So
This focus tool firmly rooted computer science
Again fall short accurately describing holistic predictive process data abandoned favor process transform prediction
Any successful description would likely focus end result
The outcome holistic predictive process prediction

I mean general sort way prediction hypothesis valuable output particular
Whether prediction hypothesis one interesting piece holistic predictive science puzzle
Predictive science prediction science strike better sound pretty good
But really
That seems
What statistic
Are applied statistician
Applied statistic comprises descriptive statistic application inferential statistic
Add prescriptive statistic seems like step right direction
However emphasis case application statistical process expense well much really
Yet I would argue actually place proper emphasis inferential prescriptive statistic perhaps implies much reliance descriptive thus seems also fall short describing science prediction
Predictive analytics
Maybe closest fit term seems closer business world point world science
I see term brought research generally seems sole domain big business
And fine seem put science forefront though clearly science underlies usage
I know solution
To fair I even know problem exists outside head
But I think everything boil following generalized beyond prediction aspect data science Does term actually represent anything value u data scientist everyone else
I purport recommendation even I I sure would passed
Which fine
But someone terribly excited comfortable term data science I think worth introspective categorize task
Sure convenience able put name broad profession somewhat related task lose tree forest
And come complex science prediction data may new oil algorithm special sauce paired predictive power actual money figuratively literally


also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

Several team researcher published review data mining process model Azevedo Santos conducted comparison SEMMA
Before data mining algorithm used target data set must assembled
As data mining uncover pattern actually present data target data set must large enough contain pattern remaining concise enough mined within acceptable time limit
A common source data
essential analyze data set data mining
The target set cleaned
Data cleaning remove observation containing
Data mining involves six common class task Data mining unintentionally misused produce result appear significant actually predict future behaviour new sample data bear little use
Often result investigating many hypothesis performing proper
A simple version problem known problem arise different phase process thus split applicable may sufficient prevent happening
The final step knowledge discovery data verify pattern produced data mining algorithm occur wider data set
Not pattern found data mining algorithm necessarily valid
It common data mining algorithm find pattern training set present general data set
This called
To overcome evaluation us data data mining algorithm trained
The learned pattern applied test set resulting output compared desired output
For example data mining algorithm trying distinguish spam legitimate email would trained sample
Once trained learned pattern would applied test set trained
The accuracy pattern measured many correctly classify
A number statistical method may used evaluate algorithm
If learned pattern meet desired standard subsequently necessary change data mining step
If learned pattern meet desired standard final step interpret learned pattern turn knowledge
The premier professional body field ACM Special Interest Group SIG Knowledge Discovery Data Mining
Since ACM SIG hosted annual international conference published proceeding since published biannual titled SIGKDD Explorations
Computer science conference data mining include Data mining topic also present many ICDE Conference There effort define standard data mining process example European standard JDM
Development successor process JDM active stalled since
JDM withdrawn without reaching final draft
For exchanging extracted model particular use key standard PMML language developed Data Mining Group DMG supported exchange format many data mining application
As name suggests cover prediction model particular data mining task high importance business application
However extension cover example proposed independently DMG
Data mining used wherever digital data available today
Notable found throughout business medicine science surveillance
While term data mining may ethical implication often associated mining information relation people behavior ethical otherwise
The way data mining used case context raise question regarding privacy legality ethic
In particular data mining government commercial data set national security law enforcement purpose Program raised privacy concern
Data mining requires data preparation uncover information pattern may compromise confidentiality privacy obligation
A common way occur
Data aggregation involves combining data together possibly various source way facilitates analysis also might make identification private data deducible otherwise apparent
This data mining result preparation data purpose analysis
The threat individual privacy come play data compiled cause data miner anyone access newly compiled data set able identify specific individual especially data originally anonymous
It recommended individual made aware following data collected Data may also modified anonymous individual may readily identified
However even anonymized data set potentially contain enough information allow identification individual occurred journalist able find several individual based set search history inadvertently released AOL
The inadvertent revelation leading provider violates Fair Information Practices
This indiscretion cause financial emotional bodily harm indicated individual
In one instance privacy violation patron Walgreens filed lawsuit company selling prescription information data mining company turn provided data pharmaceutical company
Europe rather strong privacy law effort underway strengthen right consumer
However currently effectively expose European user privacy exploitation company
As consequence increased discussion revoke agreement particular data fully exposed attempt reach agreement failed
In United States privacy concern addressed via passage regulatory control HIPAA
The HIPAA requires individual give informed consent regarding information provide intended present future us
According article n practice HIPAA may offer greater protection longstanding regulation research arena say AAHC
More importantly rule goal protection informed consent approach level incomprehensibility average individual
This underscore necessity data anonymity data aggregation mining practice
information privacy legislation HIPAA FERPA applies specific area law address
Use data mining majority business controlled legislation
Due lack flexibility European copyright mining work without permission copyright owner legal
Where database pure data Europe likely copyright database right may exist data mining becomes subject regulation
On recommendation led UK government amend copyright law allow content mining
Only second country world Japan introduced exception data mining
However due restriction UK exception allows content mining purpose
UK copyright law also allow provision overridden contractual term condition
The facilitated stakeholder discussion text data mining title Licences Europe
The focus solution legal issue licence limitation exception led representative university researcher library civil society group publisher leave stakeholder dialogue May
By contrast Europe flexible nature US copyright law particular mean content mining America well fair use country Israel Taiwan South Korea viewed legal
As content mining transformative supplant original work viewed lawful fair use
For example part presiding judge case ruled Google digitisation project book lawful part transformative us digitisation project displayed one text data mining

The consists eight
The term often used term might ambiguous byte historically used storage unit variety size
The term eight bit longer common
A sequence octet referred octet string
The international standard IEC chapter state byte octet bit
However unit historically represented various storage size history computing
Due influence several major product line byte became overwhelmingly associated eight bit
This meaning codified standard
While often used synonymously working certain careful avoid ambiguity
Octets represented using number system varying base
The binary value eight bit set activated equal hexadecimal value decimal value octal value
One octet used represent decimal value ranging
The term symbol often used use might ambiguous
It frequently used RFC publication describe storage size network protocol parameter
The earliest example
In claimed proposed usage term octet byte headed software operation France already
In used common language instead sense required example megabyte MB termed megaoctet Mo
Historically Western Europe term used specifically denote bit however usage longer common
Early example usage exist British Dutch German source throughout documentation mainframe computer
Similar term grouping three ten
Unit multiple octet may formed power prefix standardized
The octet used represent address
An address consists four octet usually shown individually series decimal value ranging separated full stop dot
Using octet eight bit set representation highest numbered address
An address consists sixteen octet shown using hexadecimal representation two digit per octet using colon character pair octet bit also known readability like CDEF
If pair consecutive octet equal zero may replaced two following colon character used given address avoid ambiguity
The previously given address thus also written CDEF
In addition leading zero may also omitted significant bit address
Applying previous example mentioned result address CDEF

Since byte eight bit computer system provides nonambiguous term
This term confused term describes number system

An octet series bit
It important designation played significant role development personal computer PC hardware device
Some first microprocessor used technology
Further IT advance led ever greater capacity like processor
In general central processing unit CPU required address bus
The actual set permutation involved octet
The conventional capacity system kilobyte KB
Because bit fundamental unit data label applied many different aspect IT including address space unit memory processor capacity
Many designation associated retro technology early computer utilized processor considered limited capacity

The state element gain lose electron attain electron configuration nearest noble gas
Here explanation work element follow octet rule
Noble gas complete outer electron shell make stable
Other element also seek stability governs reactivity bonding behavior
Halogens one electron away filled energy level reactive
Chlorine example seven electron outer electron shell
Chlorine readily bond element filled like argon
kJ per mole chlorine atom released chlorine acquires single electron
In contrast energy would required add second electron
From thermodynamic standpoint chlorine likely participate reaction atom gain single electron
The reaction possible le favorable
The octet rule informal measure favorable atom
Atoms follow octet rule always seek stable electron configuration
rule result completely filled outermost energy level
Low atomic weight element first twenty element likely adhere octet rule
Lewis electron dot diagram may drawn help account electron participating chemical bond element
A Lewis diagram count valence electron
Electrons shared counted twice
eight electron accounted around atom

chemistry arrangement outer shell atom
This structure held responsible relative inertness noble gas chemical behaviour certain element
The chemical element atomic number close element tend combine element losing gaining sharing electron result process atom attain configuration atom
This observation published separate paper German chemist Walther Kossel American chemist known rule eight used determine valence combining capacity several chemical element
Kossel octet electron taken stable arrangement outermost shell atom
Although atom possessed arrangement condition toward atom element tended chemical bonding

cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

All men mortal
Socrates man
Therefore Socrates mortal
Logical argument like one studied since antiquity
In last decade however logic research changed considerably computer science born
The success informatics would impossible without groundwork provided logician turn computer science keep posing new interesting question answered formal logic
Informatics successor logic field keep moving forward hand hand
Simple logical conclusion famous syllogism Socrates mortality appear clear simple u
But formalizing obvious
Just like mathematics logic allows u construct arbitrarily complex equation sophisticated calculation analyse world
Even first electronic calculating device built research hypothetical possibility computer done mathematician Alan Turing Alonzo Church characterized class mathematical problem principle tackled
Turing put forward intriguingly simple model calculating machine Turing machine It move infinitely long ribbon read number change according given set rule
Such machine built mechanical gear lego brick
Although practice machine highly inefficient one show principle conceivable computer calculation carried simple device
With Turing machine became possible clearly define mathematical calculation even mean
Using concept Turing could show question never answered computer computer program read program decides whether calculation would ever come halt go forever logically impossible
Today research logic done computer scientist mathematician say Professor Helmut Veith Vienna University Technology
Logic fulfil several task
First tool describe world
Logic used database creating artificial intelligence
But logic help computer view world also offer possibility introspection computer code check computer code look logical error
It similar way human think say Helmut Veith
We think world around u also contemplate mind
quality check computer code verification model checking play important role industry economy
When user test program find work mean guarantee program free error
The crucial question code react correctly conceivable input logically possible situation
This determined automated program
Such reliable check particularly important security relevant code airplane control
Logical check essential production computer chip well
Today chip start program long physically built
No human could ever determine hand whether chip indeed react correctly given situation
Computer program carry task
With logical check ensure safety
A future computer might lot slimier solid silicon device today
In study published journal Materials Today European researcher reveal detail logic unit built using living slime mold Alan Turing showed computer simply manifestation underlying logical architecture matter material made
Although computer familiar For first time public Kasparov played match chess program live stage The University Alan Turing Centenary Conference
As computer scientist year celebrate anniversary birth mathematical genius Alan Turing set basis digital computing anticipate electronic age still quest
This year series event around world celebrate work Alan Turing father modern computer anniversary birthday approach June

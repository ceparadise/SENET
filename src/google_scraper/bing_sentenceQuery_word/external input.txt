For reason considered audio output device
Without audio output device miss audio cue computer error beep important system message alerting system problem
This keep sync computer allowing effectively recognize identify issue
There real disadvantage audio output device need additional hardware sound card additional power supply possibility making noise
There primarily three type storage computer posse first primary storage popularly called simply memory secondary storage popularly referred simply storage finally offline storage referred movable storage
Primary Storage Primary storage computer store data temporary basis process data
Think primary storage short term memory
Primary storage type memory directly accessible computer processor volatile temporary nature erased power turned
The main primary storage RAM Random Access Memory ROM Read Only Memory Data computer currently processing data computer know need processing stored primary storage
Memory primary storage accessed quickly CPU
Its storage capacity however much smaller stored secondary tertiary storage
Computers need enough primary storage function temporarily hold anticipated amount data processing
Secondary Storage Secondary storage computer store data currently processing may need later time
Secondary storage thought long term memory storage nature data remains intact even power computer turned
Operating system document music file typically stored secondary storage device
They also external movement transport
The main device secondary storage hard disk drive HDD

operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Τhis sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

In unambiguous specification solve class problem
Algorithms perform task
An algorithm expressed within finite amount space time formal language calculating
Starting initial state initial input perhaps instruction describe proceeds finite number successive state eventually producing output terminating final ending state
The transition one state next necessarily algorithm known incorporate random input
The concept existed century however partial formalization would become modern began attempt solve decision problem posed
Subsequent formalization framed attempt define effective method formalization included
Giving formal definition algorithm corresponding intuitive notion remains challenging problem
The word combination word named word
αριθμός meaning number
mathematician scholar whose name mean native region part
About wrote treatise Arabic language translated century title
This title mean Algoritmi number Indians Algoritmi translator Latinization name
widely read mathematician Europe late Middle Ages primarily book
In late medieval Latin English corruption name simply meant decimal number system
In century influence Greek word ἀριθμός Latin word altered corresponding English term first attested century modern sense introduced century
In English first used
English adopted French term late century algorithm took meaning modern English
Another early use word manual titled composed
It begin thus translates Algorism art present use Indian figure number two time five
The poem hundred line long summarizes art calculating new style Indian dice Talibus Indorum Hindu numeral
An informal definition could set rule precisely defines sequence operation
would include computer program including program perform numeric calculation
Generally program algorithm stop eventually
A prototypical example algorithm determine maximum common divisor two integer example others described example later section
offer informal meaning word following quotation No human write fast enough long enough small smaller smaller without limit trying write molecule atom electron list member enumerably infinite set writing name one another notation
But human something equally useful case certain enumerably infinite set They give arbitrary finite
Such instruction given quite explicitly form An enumerably infinite set one whose element put correspondence integer
Thus Boolos Jeffrey saying algorithm implies instruction process creates output integer input integer integer theory arbitrarily large
Thus algorithm algebraic equation two arbitrary input variable produce output
But various author attempt define notion indicate word implies much something order addition example The concept also used define notion
That notion central explaining come starting small set rule
In time algorithm requires complete measured apparently related customary physical dimension
From uncertainty characterize ongoing work stem unavailability definition suit concrete sense abstract usage term
Algorithms essential way computer process data
Many computer program contain algorithm detail specific instruction computer perform specific order carry specified task calculating employee paycheck printing student report card
Thus algorithm considered sequence operation simulated system
Authors assert thesis include Minsky Savage Gurevich Minsky But also maintain Turing


procedure could naturally called effective fact realized simple machine
Although may seem extreme argument


favor hard refute
Gurevich Turing informal argument favor thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm simulated Turing machine according Savage algorithm computational process defined Turing machine
Typically algorithm associated processing information data read input source written output device stored processing
Stored data regarded part internal state entity performing algorithm
In practice state stored one
For computational process algorithm must rigorously defined specified way applies possible circumstance could arise
That conditional step must systematically dealt criterion case must clear computable
Because algorithm precise list precise step order computation always crucial functioning algorithm
Instructions usually assumed listed explicitly described starting top going bottom idea described formally
So far discussion formalization algorithm assumed premise
This common conception attempt describe task discrete mechanical mean
Unique conception formalized algorithm setting value variable
It derives intuition scratchpad
There example assignment
For alternate conception constitutes algorithm see
Algorithms expressed many kind notation including processed
Natural language expression algorithm tend verbose ambiguous rarely used complex technical algorithm
Pseudocode flowchart control table structured way express algorithm avoid many ambiguity common natural language statement
Programming language primarily intended expressing algorithm form executed computer often used way define document algorithm
There wide variety representation possible one express given program sequence machine table see flowchart see form rudimentary called set quadruple see
Representations algorithm classed three accepted level Turing machine description For example simple algorithm Add described three level see
Most algorithm intended implemented
However algorithm also implemented mean biological example implementing insect looking food mechanical device
In algorithm basically instance written software software developer effective intended target computer produce given perhaps null
An optimal algorithm even running old hardware would produce faster result higher algorithm purpose running efficient hardware algorithm like computer hardware considered technology
The notion simplicity elegance appears informally Knuth precisely Chaitin Chaitin preface definition I show ca prove program proof would solve ibid
For given function multiple algorithm may exist
This true even without expanding available instruction set available programmer
Rogers observes It


important distinguish notion
procedure notion
mapping yielded procedure
The function may several different algorithm
Unfortunately may tradeoff goodness speed elegance compactness elegant program may take step complete computation one le elegant
An example us Euclid algorithm appears
A computer human computor restricted type machine discrete deterministic mechanical device blindly follows instruction
Melzak Lambek primitive model reduced notion four element discrete distinguishable ii discrete indistinguishable iii agent iv list instruction relative capability agent

proceeds sequentially five six depending one count instruction unless either conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO change program flow sequence
Besides HALT Minsky machine includes three replacement substitution operation ZERO

Rarely must programmer write code limited instruction set
But Minsky show Melzak Lambek machine four general instruction conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO HALT
Knuth advises reader best way learn algorithm try


immediately take pen paper work example
But simulation execution real thing
The programmer must translate algorithm language execute
Stone give example computing root quadratic equation computor must know take square root
If algorithm effective must provide set rule extracting square root
This mean programmer must know language effective relative target computing agent
But model used simulation
Van Emde Boas observes even base abstract instead concrete machine arbitrariness choice model remains
It point notion enters
When speed measured instruction set matter
For example subprogram Euclid algorithm compute remainder would execute much faster programmer instruction available rather subtraction worse Minsky decrement
Per algorithm computed model known per Minsky demonstration Turing completeness requires four instruction GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment HALT
Kemeny Kurtz observe undisciplined use unconditional GOTOs conditional GOTOs result programmer write structured program using instruction hand also possible hard write badly structured program structured language
Tausworthe augments three SEQUENCE two CASE
An additional benefit structured program lends using
The graphical aide called offer way describe document algorithm computer program one
Like program flow Minsky machine flowchart always start top page proceeds
Its primary symbol four directed arrow showing program flow rectangle SEQUENCE GOTO diamond dot
The canonical structure made primitive shape

The symbol use build canonical structure shown diagram
One simplest algorithm find largest number list number random order
Finding solution requires looking every number list
From follows simple algorithm stated description English prose Written prose much closer language computer program following formal coding algorithm algorithm compute GCD two number appears Proposition II Book VII Elementary Number Theory
Euclid pose problem thus Given two number prime one another find greatest common measure
He defines A number multitude composed unit counting number positive integer including zero
To measure place shorter measuring length successively time along longer length remaining portion le shorter length
In modern word remainder quotient remainder modulus part left division
For Euclid method succeed starting length must satisfy two requirement length must zero AND ii subtraction must proper test must guarantee smaller two number subtracted larger alternately two equal subtraction yield zero
Euclid original proof add third requirement two length must prime one another
Euclid stipulated could construct proof two number common measure fact
While Nicomachus algorithm Euclid number prime one another yield number common measure
So precise following really Nicomachus algorithm
Only instruction required execute Euclid logical test conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment replacement subtraction
The following algorithm framed Knuth version Euclid Nicomachus rather using division find remainder us successive subtraction shorter length remaining length le
The description shown boldface adapted Knuth Until remaining length R le shorter length S repeatedly subtract measuring number S remaining length EITHER last measure exact remainder R zero program halt OR ii algorithm must continue last measure left remainder R le measuring number The nut Euclid algorithm
Use remainder measure previously smaller number L serf temporary location
The following version Euclid algorithm requires six core instruction thirteen required Inelegant worse Inelegant requires instruction

Yes
What happens one number zero number zero
Inelegant computes forever case Elegant computes forever A
What happens number entered

A notable failure due exception rocket failure June
Knuth demonstrates application extended version Euclid algorithm proposes general method applicable proving validity algorithm
Tausworthe proposes measure complexity program length correctness proof
With six core instruction Elegant clear winner compared Inelegant thirteen instruction
However Inelegant arrives HALT fewer step
indicates case Elegant conditional test every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant one
As algorithm usually requires many much time wasted B
test needed remainder computed
Once programmer judge program fit effective computes function intended question becomes improved
The compactness Inelegant improved elimination five step
But Chaitin proved compacting algorithm automated generalized algorithm rather done exhaustive search example found trial error cleverness insight application etc
Observe step repeated step
Comparison Elegant provides hint step together step eliminated
This reduces number core instruction thirteen eight make elegant Elegant nine step
The speed Elegant improved moving
test outside two subtraction loop
This change call addition three instruction B A GOTO
Now Elegant computes faster whether always case given A B R S would require detailed analysis
It frequently important know much particular resource time storage theoretically required given algorithm
Methods developed obtain quantitative answer estimate example sorting algorithm time requirement O using length list
At time algorithm need remember two value largest number found far current position input list
Therefore said space requirement space required store input number counted O counted
Different algorithm may complete task different set instruction le time space others
For example algorithm cost O log n outperforms sequential search cost O n used sorted list array
The discipline often practiced abstractly without use specific implementation
In sense algorithm analysis resembles mathematical discipline focus underlying property algorithm specific particular implementation
Usually used analysis simplest general representation
However ultimately algorithm usually implemented particular hardware software platform eventually put test using real code
For solution one problem efficiency particular algorithm may significant consequence unless n extremely large algorithm designed fast interactive commercial long life scientific usage may critical
Scaling small n large n frequently expose inefficient algorithm otherwise benign
Empirical testing useful may uncover unexpected interaction affect performance
may used compare potential improvement algorithm program optimization
To illustrate potential improvement possible even well established algorithm recent significant innovation relating algorithm used heavily field image processing decrease processing time time application like medical imaging
In general speed improvement depend special property problem common practical application
Speedups magnitude enable computing device make extensive use image processing like digital camera medical equipment consume le power
There various way classify algorithm merit
One way classify algorithm implementation mean
Another way classifying algorithm design methodology paradigm
There certain number paradigm different
Furthermore category include many different type algorithm
Some common paradigm For specific classification algorithm algorithm problem may fall one general category described well one following Every field science problem need efficient algorithm
Related problem one field often studied together
Some example class algorithm
Fields tend overlap algorithm advance one field may improve sometimes completely unrelated field
For example dynamic programming invented optimization resource consumption industry used solving broad range problem many field
Algorithms classified amount time need complete compared input size Some problem may multiple algorithm differing complexity problem might algorithm known efficient algorithm
There also mapping problem problem
Owing found suitable classify problem instead algorithm equivalence class based complexity best possible algorithm
The adjective continuous applied word algorithm mean Algorithms usually patentable
In United States claim consisting solely simple manipulation abstract concept number signal constitute process USPTO hence algorithm patentable
However practical application algorithm sometimes patentable
For example application simple algorithm aid curing deemed patentable
The highly controversial highly criticized patent involving algorithm especially algorithm
Additionally cryptographic algorithm export restriction see

describe employ algorithmic procedure compute time place significant astronomical event
To keep track flock sack grain money ancient used tallying accumulating stone mark scratched stick making discrete symbol clay
Through Babylonian Egyptian use mark symbol eventually evolved Dilson
Tally mark appear prominently arithmetic used computation
The work ancient whose name term algorithm derived Western European mathematician culminated notion ca A good century half ahead time Leibniz proposed algebra logic algebra would specify rule manipulating logical concept manner ordinary algebra specifies rule manipulating number
Bolter credit invention The key invention Europe Middle Ages particular provides u tick tock mechanical clock
The accurate automatic machine led immediately mechanical beginning century finally computational machine Countess century
Lovelace credited first creation algorithm intended processing computer Babbage analytical engine first device considered real computer instead sometimes called history first programmer result though full implementation Babbage second device would realized decade lifetime
The technical problem reduce presented form similar known
Jevons describes first simple abacus slip wood furnished pin contrived part class logical combination picked mechanically


More recently however I reduced system completely mechanical form thus embodied whole indirect process inference may called His machine came equipped certain moveable wooden rod foot key like piano etc


With machine could analyze simple logical argument
This machine displayed Fellows Royal Society
Another logician however turned jaundiced eye effort I high estimate interest importance sometimes called logical machine seem contrivance present known likely discovered really deserve name logical machine see
But outdone presented plan somewhat analogous I apprehend Jevon And gain corresponding Jevons logical machine following contrivance may described
I prefer call merely machine I suppose could completely rationally expected logical machine
Bell Newell indicate precursor punch card telephone switching technology root tree leading development first computer
By century precursor telephone use throughout world discrete distinguishable encoding letter dot dash common sound
By late century ca use use Hollerith card census
Then came ca
use tape
electromechanical invented behind work inventor digital adding device
As worked Bell Laboratories observed burdensome use mechanical calculator gear
He went home one evening intending test idea
When tinkering Stibitz constructed binary adding device
Davis observes particular importance electromechanical relay two binary state In rapid succession mathematics reduced arithmetic sequence symbol manipulated rule
Peano first attempt axiomatization mathematics symbolic language
But Heijenoort give Frege kudos Frege perhaps important single work ever written logic
see language language written special symbol pure thought free rhetorical embellishment constructed specific symbol manipulated according definite rule
The work Frege simplified amplified
At time number disturbing paradox appeared literature particular
The resultant consideration led paper specifically cite paradox completely reduces rule number
In effort solve defined precisely Hilbert mathematician first set define meant effective method effective calculation effective calculability calculation would succeed
In rapid succession following appeared finely honed definition general recursion work Gödel acting suggestion cf
Gödel Princeton lecture subsequent simplification Kleene
Church proof Entscheidungsproblem unsolvable definition effective calculability worker mindlessly following list instruction move left right sequence room either mark erase paper observe paper make decision next instruction
Alan Turing proof Entscheidungsproblem unsolvable use machine effect almost identical Post formulation definition effective method term machine
proposal precursor called Thesis I year later Kleene renaming Thesis Church Thesis proposing Turing Thesis
Here remarkable coincidence two men knowing describing process working yield virtually identical definition
described action computer human follows His symbol space would work preceded Stibitz unknown whether Stibitz knew work Turing
Turing biographer believed Turing use model derived youthful interest Alan dreamt inventing typewriter boy Turing typewriter could well begun asking meant calling typewriter
Given prevalence Morse code telegraphy ticker tape machine teletypewriter might conjecture influence
model computation called Post analysis human computer whittle simple set basic motion state mind
But continues step creates machine model computation number
Turing reduction yield following It may change necessarily invoke change state mind
The general single operation must therefore taken one following A year later Turing expanded analysis thesis definition forceful expression defined mathematical method following manner italicization added Rosser footnote No
reference work Church Kleene definition particular Church use Herbrand Gödel use recursion particular Gödel use famous paper Post Turing computation
defined Thesis I known
But following context boldface original A number effort directed toward refinement definition algorithm activity issue surrounding particular especially especially argument

concise visual representation specifying action perform depending given condition
They whose output set action
The information expressed decision table could also represented series statement
Each decision corresponds variable relation predicate whose possible value listed among condition alternative
Each action procedure operation perform entry specify whether order action performed set condition alternative entry corresponds
To make concise many decision table include condition alternative symbol
This hyphen blank although using blank discouraged may merely indicate decision table finished
One us decision table reveal condition certain input factor irrelevant action taken allowing input test skipped thereby streamlining procedure
Aside basic four quadrant structure decision table vary widely way condition alternative action entry represented
Some decision table use simple value represent alternative condition similar table may use numbered alternative similar table even use fuzzy logic probabilistic representation condition alternative
In similar way action entry simply represent whether action performed check action perform advanced decision table sequencing action perform number action perform
A decision table considered includes every possible combination input variable
In word balanced decision table prescribe action every situation input variable provided
The decision table simplest describe
The condition alternative simple Boolean value action entry representing action given column performed
A technical support company writes decision table diagnose printer problem based upon symptom described phone client
The following created Systems Made Simple
Of course simple example necessarily correspond reality printer troubleshooting even demonstrates decision table scale several condition many possibility
Decision table especially coupled use allow developer policy expert work information decision table
Tools render nested statement traditional programming language decision table also used debugging tool
Decision table proven easier understand review code used extensively successfully produce specification complex system

also called collection data specially organized rapid search retrieval
Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary
early adopter computer database technology
In United States National Crime Information Center NCIC established police record subsequently computerized made available police agency throughout country
The NCIC database enables local police department apprehend offender might otherwise evade advent database marketing individual customer characteristic purchase history retained company information system
Even company particularly large retailer catalog house compile comprehensive data individual customer able customize offering communication

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

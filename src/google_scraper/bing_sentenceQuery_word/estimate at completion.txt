Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included clearly state calculate estimate completion EAC different situation
I tell personal experience EAC calculation question may get examination quite confusing
The PMP exam ass ability understand concept EAC well correct application EAC need understand different way calculating EAC
There four general category EAC calculation
They follows This formula used original estimation fundamentally flawed
It calculates actual plus new estimate remaining work
This formula used original estimation met without deviation
It signifies project going well maintaining CPI SPI continue project way
It always good project manager maintaining CPI SPI even
This formula used current deviation original estimation thought different future
It generally AC plus remaining value work perform
This formula used calculate actual date plus remaining budget changed based performance
It used believe current ratio typical planned
In word meet schedule earlier originally determined calculate EAC accordingly meet schedule
Now better understanding different way calculate Estimate Completion well way attaining PMP certification

By We aware forecasting help u predict future event
Forecasting used every part world people use many subjective criterion predict
Some people use movement moon star predict future others use palm line predict
In project management also use forecasting come future performance result forecasting based objective evidence
Forecasting provides u visibility future progress project give project sponsor early idea may go wrong
In project management three technique commonly used forecasting
These technique follows In blog post I going discus Estimate Completion
For two technique refer blog post
Okay let get started
Projects executed real world real world activity always go planned
There many circumstance beyond control may deviate project planned path might lead change project
As project manager must keep track change evaluate impact project parameter
Now question evaluate impact change
You help project forecasting tool Estimate Completion
The Estimate Completion EAC give forecasted value project complete
It tell much may spend complete project
In word say amount money project cost end
The Estimate Completion determined four method depending way project performing
However PMP Certification exam point view first method important rest
In scenario assume project continue perform end performing
Simply put future performance past performance
CPI remain rest project
Formula Calculate Estimate Completion Estimate Completion Budget Completion Cost Performance Index Or EAC Please note In blog post I going explain four commonly used formula calculate EAC
However PMP exam important le chance see question based case
Anyway I going explain formula mentioned PMBOK Guide worry
Given question Budget Completion BAC Actual Cost AC Planned Value PV Earned Value EV To calculate EAC first calculate Cost Performance Index Cost Performance Index CPI EV AC Cost Performance Index CPI Now Estimate Completion EAC Hence Estimate Completion EAC USD
It mean project continues progress CPI end spend USD complete project
Here say deviated budget estimate however onwards complete remaining work planned
Usually happens due unforeseen condition incident happens cost elevates however sure happen continue planned cost estimate
That formula calculate EAC simply add money spent date
AC budgeted cost remaining work
Formula Calculate Estimate Completion EAC AC BAC EV Since cost elevation temporary nature rest project completed planned case use formula EAC AC BAC EV Given question Actual Cost AC Budget Completion BAC Earned Value EV Hence EAC Hence Estimate Completion USD
You budget behind schedule client insisting complete project time
In case cost schedule also taken consideration
In word say cost performance poor also behind schedule must complete project time use formula
Formula Calculate Estimate Completion EAC AC BAC EV Given question Budget Completion BAC Actual Cost AC Earned Value EV Planned Value PV To calculate EAC first calculate CPI SPI
SPI CPI Now use formula EAC AC BAC EV Hence Estimate Completion USD
This case find cost estimate flawed need calculate new cost estimate remaining work project
Here go activity level find cost activity sum get total cost remaining work
Given question Budget Completion BAC Actual Cost AC Earned Value EV Bottom Up Estimate Complete In case use formula EAC AC Bottom Estimate Complete Hence Estimate Completion USD
Estimate Complete amount money complete remaining work work left certain period
Visit In simple word To Complete Performance Index tell fast move achieve target
It estimate future cost performance may need complete project within approved budget
This budget may initial approved budget BAC new approved budget
Estimate Completion EAC

Hope answer query
Thanks Fahad hope joyous Eid celebration family You welcome
How decide formula used
e g Instead using BAC CPI I use AC BAC EV calculate EAC I get different answer example mentioned

Loving Study Notes job
Found site today PMP study time wanted say I really like logical simplifed approach

Sorry I also wanted say I looking forward next blog
Dont worry going see many post Have mock PMP question asking formula forecasting EAC using remaning budget correct answer
Please explain I find option book I I find ACC acronym stand
There typing error formula given
Here correct formula EAC AC BAC EV Hi Fahad wandering EVM EAC EV Finally e EAC How driven
thanks much indeed support Ala For exam sufficient know formula derivation formula outside scope exam
Hi Fahad Can explain TCPI To Complete Performance Index
Thanks advance It explained Thanks Fahad cant get simpler explained different type EAC
You gave clear explanation I confident I understand use formula
Thanks
You welcome Ken
yes indeed article simple elborative Thanks Ala
I found site today PMP study would like say thank logical eloborated information
Thanks comment Mohan
Thank explanation scenario using SPI CPI together clear mean schedule
These two different parameter
For schedule performance look SPI
Dear Fahd context would kindly send various scenario might encountered PMP EXAM CPI TCPI EV CV SV ETC BAC thanks lot salam ala These topic already explained blog
Please refer given blog post Regarding EAC case following Here calculate EAC term budget money cost give new budget money cost
But find EAC term schedule time term new schedule time much schedule time required complete remaining work
Thanks EAC calculated budget
For schedule use To complete schedule performance index SPI
How would go finding estimated time completion thanks Dear Fahed great effort usual appreciate effort smooth explanation mind question Case mentioned CPI end project problem face problem exam guess CPI use formula
case II highlighted complete remaining work planned mean
I understood BAC end project mean value BAC equal EAC
complete remaining work planned
finally calculated EAC BAC
completed remaining work planned
Thanks advance Best regard For I already written In scenario assume project continue perform end performing
In second case spend till certain point however complete task previously estimated cost
Dear Fahad A mathematical example Estimate Completion However per schedule earned USD date
Why earned I believe planned value PV Yes planed value
Dear Fahad If possible explain following logic behind using Money value measure time
using PV equation indicate behind ahead schedule Thanks regard Then tell going measure schedule
logic wise measure length meter time Hours day schedule measured
time result SV measured time metric So person invented Earned value planned value
result behind schedule ahead schedule show time
Earned Value Management money much spent earned progressing term
Thank explanation
going internet I got logic behind PV
Sorry I caused inconvenience No problem Mr Basem
Can please let know project schedule input determine budget process
It planning process using schedule baseline input

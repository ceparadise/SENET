I often read programming language clear others I asked several time objective way measure clarity language order design given abstract syntax concrete syntax clear human friendly possible
Perhaps exist kind design pattern purpose
In short How achieved maximum clarity syntax
Know way quantify clarity expressiveness language
Makes sense try measure aspect
Thanks
I heard phrase many time carelessly thrown different language different people choose different language based different criterion
In Yukihiro Matsumoto Ruby designer make argument much simpler write Hello World program Ruby Java
Although I think example meant scale author point amount cruft add code reflects deficulty understanding program written language
That le distraction get readable program
Now experience good programmer write clear code language program though even clearly language familiar
The author talent well breadth experience lenguage end dwarfing language clarity expressiveness
Another point consider amount available library quality APIs
If write le support code get job done likely resulting program clearer appears straight point
There study called natural programming may interest They attempt design language meet human expectation instead trying conform people simplest computer
And basing experiment
For instance studying many people bring back pear box fruit instruct bring back something apple pear
I kept result sounded like promising project
Still clarity expressiveness nebulous thing gauge
There course study quantitative measure language one another like
Some people taken data solution offered game graphed trend like code size performance You might able make shaky proposition based trend code size take perform given task efficiently
But pinning fairly subjective notion clarity expressiveness
I biased believe shorter program work faster often clearer many counterexample
So I say absence defined target audience usability study test subject wo much better kind metric making generalization language
I think
Clarity subjective design pattern good measure clarity language indeed design pattern usually born circumvent limitation language
Some people like language rich concise semantic
perl really mind use symbol prefers syntax resembles natural language appear speak computer
Hypercard really mind verbosity ambiguousness
A question like usually result pedantic answer
Languages like tool
They built suit certain purpose
Logic programming language solve certain problem elegant way object oriented program would
Similarly many main stream solution easily done typical object oriented procedural language
Temperament factor tool user case programmer also matter
Some folk achieved nifty solution Perl always looked like black magic
I prefer Python structural simplicity
For use white space abominable
It would best subjective evaluation evaluation language clarity expressivity
How ever clear indication wealth code production language
Some language like brainfuck adopted Python Ruby etc gained popularity
Although many factor indicator
Some language despite good construct may find much taker
Network effect also affect language adoption
I find LOLCODE understandable language Measuring understandability language important measuring understandability programmer
You also look book Concepts Programming Languages Latest Edition BY Sebesta
There chapter book chapter I remember exactly discus criterion evaluate programming language
By posting answer agree

Mobile application software system run device iPads tablet PCs
A number programming language used developing application Java used Android application C used iOS C used Windows
Every company sale clerk provides place channel distribute application Android application iOS device
According Minelli Lanza mobile application market rapidly increasing point billion dollar spent application
Mobile application like software become complex need constantly evolved order fix bug add remove function enhance user interface etc
The increase complexity size software affected various quality factor like understandability reliability testability maintainability
The maintenance operation time consuming requires great deal effort
One main problem facing maintenance process software engineer may good understanding source code
A study carried Nazir show maintenance process cost total cost system software time may taken trying understand code
The understandability software system important maintenance team produce new bug understand code properly
Sometimes maintenance programmer write source code need spend time reading understanding software documentation
Any misunderstanding software may cause failure deliver qualified product
Reto state since Android open source anyone modify consistent software layout design however least support particular feature like storage connectivity web browser many feature influence Android application software
This paper focus understandability Android application measured metric tool related understandability
Understandability software system significant life cycle software development ensure software maintainable testable also minimize cost time
Jacob Waldermarsson mention significance understandability obvious maintain evolve something understand work
The purpose paper determine important metric measure understandability Android application determine factor influential measurement understandability using appropriate tool
The paper test following research hypothesis statement Android software metric effective measuring understandability Android application
Android software metric effective measuring understandability Android application
We reject null hypothesis Android software metric appear understandability index formula
To test dataset DS defined show value software metric regression analysis also used build understandability index formula given value software metric
At beginning aspect delineation Google bought Android everything related
They decided make Android open source anyone could download Android application code use add new feature
Also stakeholder could apply special feature would encourage many development company produce effective product order match demand
The major characteristic adopting Android represents integrated approach development Android application
According Reto development company must able develop application capable run kind device

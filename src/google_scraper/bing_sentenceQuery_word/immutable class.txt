In programming unchangeable object whose state modified created
This contrast changeable object modified created
In case object considered immutable even internally used attribute change object state appears unchanging external point view
For example object us cache result expensive computation could still considered immutable object
Strings concrete object typically expressed immutable object improve readability runtime efficiency
Immutable object also useful inherently
Other benefit simpler understand reason offer higher security mutable object
In value held whose content never change known differentiate variable could altered execution
Examples include conversion factor meter foot value several decimal place
field may calculated program run unlike constant known beforehand never change initialized
Sometimes one talk certain object immutable
This mean way change part object state even though part object may changeable
If field immutable object immutable
If whole object extended another class object called
This might example help explicitly enforce certain invariant certain data object staying lifetime object
In language done keyword
designates field immutable
In language reversed field object record default immutable need explicitly marked
In object referred using
Some example language many
In case matter whether state object vary object shared via reference
If object known immutable copied simply making copy instead copying entire object
Because reference typically size usually much smaller object result memory saving potential boost execution speed
The reference copying technique much difficult use mutable object user reference mutable object change user reference see change
If intended effect difficult notify user respond correctly
In situation entire object rather reference usually easy costly solution
The alternative technique handling change mutable object
A technique blend advantage object supported directly almost modern hardware COW
Using technique user asks system copy object instead merely create new reference still point object
As soon user attempt modify object particular reference system make real copy applies modification set reference refer new copy
The user unaffected still refer original object
Therefore COW user appear mutable version object although case user modify object speed advantage immutable object preserved
popular system allows save memory space still correctly handling anything application program might
The practice always using reference place copy equal object known
If interning used two object considered equal reference typically represented integer equal
Some language automatically example automatically
If algorithm implement interning guaranteed every case possible comparing object equality reduced comparing pointer substantial gain speed application
Even algorithm guaranteed comprehensive still exists possibility case improvement object equal use reference
Interning generally useful immutable object
Immutable object useful application
Multiple thread act data represented immutable object without concern data changed thread
Immutable object therefore considered mutable object
Immutability imply object stored computer unwriteable
Rather immutability construct indicates programmer normal interface object necessarily absolutely instance circumventing type system violating
In string immutable object
Both Java Framework mutable version string
In Java mutable version Java mutable version
mutable string byte variant named
Additionally Java immutable
Similar pattern
In pure language possible create mutable object without extending language
via mutable reference library object immutable
In object declared either
mutable typically implicit default
immutable via keyword
Subprogram parameter immutable mode mutable mode
In enforce immutability field class statement
By enforcing field immutable obtain immutable type
In implementation would allow user declare new instance class either immutable mutable desired providing two different version method
Notice necessary fact impossible provide specialized constructor instance
Note field pointer reference another object might still possible mutate object pointed pointer reference within const method without violating
It argued case object really immutable
also provides abstract opposed bitwise immutability via keyword allows member variable changed within method
A classic example immutable object instance Java class The method change data ABC contains
Instead new String object instantiated given data abc construction
A reference String object returned method
To make String contain data abc different approach needed
Now String reference new String object contains abc
There nothing syntax class String enforces immutable rather none String class method ever affect data String object contains thus making immutable
The keyword used implementing immutable primitive type object reference make immutable
See example Primitive type variable etc
reassigned defined
This prevented using
Reference type made immutable using keyword
prevents reassignment
Primitive wrapper also immutable
Immutable class implemented following simple guideline
In one create immutable class Moo library simply declaring attribute read Creating immutable class used require two step first creating accessors either automatically manually prevent modification object attribute secondly preventing direct modification instance data instance class usually stored hash reference could locked Hash function Or manually written accessor In type number booleans string tuples frozensets immutable custom class generally mutable
To simulate immutability class one override attribute setting deletion raise exception The standard library helper creates simple immutable class roughly equivalent plus feature
In type number string immutable custom object generally mutable
To simulate immutability object one may define property writable false
However approach still allow new property added
Alternatively one may use make existing object immutable
The use immutable state become rising trend JavaScript since introduction favour state management pattern
substantially diverges implementation making core pair type con cell immutable
Instead provides parallel mutable pair type via etc
In addition many immutable type supported example immutable string vector used extensively
New structs immutable default unless field specifically declared mutable whole struct The language also support immutable hash table implemented functionally immutable dictionary
In entity narrowly binding defined mutable immutable declaration one use value immutable entity variable mutable one
Note even though immutable binding reassigned may still refer mutable object still possible call mutating method object immutable underlying may mutable
For example following code snippet defines immutable entity integer type inferred mutable entity named
By default collection class immutable return new instance rather mutating existing one
While may sound inefficient implementation class guarantee immutability mean new instance existing node especially case creating copy efficient

This could dumbest question ever asked I think total confusion newbie
A nice example Java really appreciated
Immutable mean constructor object completed execution instance ca altered
This useful mean pas reference object around without worrying someone else going change content

worry caller might change text string
If imagine similar class rather member see caller would able alter attribute instance
Also beware different kind immutability might find Eric Lippert wrote
Basically object whose interface immutable behind scene actual mutables private state therefore ca shared safely thread
An immutable object object internal field least internal field affect external behavior changed
There lot advantage immutable string Take following operation The underlying C substring method probably something like Note If String object mutable character could change later would copy character otherwise change character substring would reflected string later
If internal structure immutable object valid always valid
There chance different thread create invalid state within object
Hence immutable object
It much easier garbage collector make logical decision immutable object
However also downside immutability Wait I thought said performance upside immutability
Well sometimes always
Take following code The two line replace fourth character letter
Not second piece code readable faster
Look would underlying code foo
The substring easy already character space five something else might referencing foo ca change copy whole string course functionality abstracted function real underlying C point show code get executed one place
Note concatenate get called meaning entire string looped
Compare C code operation The mutable string operation obviously much faster
In case want immutable string
But need lot appending inserting string need mutability speed
If want concurrency safety garbage collection benefit key keep mutable object local method Since object local reference worry concurrency safety one thread ever touch
And since referenced anywhere else allocated stack deallocated soon function call finished worry garbage collection
And get performance benefit mutability immutability
Actually String immutable use wikipedia definition suggested
String state change post construction
Take look hashcode method
String cache hashcode value local field calculate first call hashcode
This lazy evaluation hashcode place String interesting position immutable object whose state change observed changed without using reflection
So maybe definition immutable object observed changed
If state change immutable object created see without reflection object still immutable
Immutable object object ca changed programmatically
They especially good environment environment one process able alter mutate value object
Just clarify however StringBuilder actually mutable object immutable one
A regular java String immutable meaning created change underlying string without changing object
For example let say I class called ColoredString String value String color In example ColoredString said mutable change mutate one key property without creating new ColoredString class
The reason may bad example let say GUI application multiple thread using ColoredStrings print data window
If instance ColoredString created Then would expect string always Blue
If another thread however got ahold instance called You would suddenly probably unexpectedly Red string wanted Blue one
Because immutable object almost always preferred passing instance object around
When case mutable object really necessary would typically guard objet passing copy specific field control
To recap Java immutable object changed created mutable object changed without creating new instance
String Old string String New String The original string memory change reference variable changed refers new string
And Old String would still memory able access immutable mean change value
If instance String class method call seems modify value actually create another String
To preserve change something like foo Immutable v mutable funny work collection
Think happen use mutable object key map change value tip think
I really like explaination
To make Java memory efficient JVM set aside special area memory called String constant pool
When compiler encounter String literal check pool see identical String already exists
If match found reference new literal directed existing String new String literal object created
Objects immutable state changed created
There three main reason use immutable object whenever help reduce number bug introduce code There also optimisation might able make code know state object immutable caching calculated hash example optimisation therefore nearly interesting
It might bit late order understand immutable object consider following example new Java Date Time API
As probably know date object Java following example Output This print year initial date return new object old date still unchanged immutable object
Once created modify date variable still point
So code example capture use new object instantiated returned call
One meaning value stored computer For string example mean string memory changed When think changing fact creating new string memory pointing existing variable pointer actual collection character somewhere else new string
Once instanciated altered
Consider class instance might used key hashtable similar
Check Java best practice
Immutable mean object created non member change
immutable since change content
For example In code string change another object created using
object created Hi value
object created reference object
previous object value change String type String type immutable type instead compiler create new String object Bye value referenced
print value result Hi Bye referenced previous object Hi value
As per Java Reference Documentation An object considered immutable state change constructed Simply immutable class class whose property modified creation
That mean creation instance data provided remain unchanged till destruction object
Immutable class great concurrent application
As per immutable nature help maintain application consistent behavior state instance changed
Immutable class easy design develop use error resistant secure due immutability
However programmer reluctant use due limitation
Also may performance impact object creation reusing
However latest sophisticated compiler cost creation minimal
Also provided capability advantage immutability adopted beyond per need
New String object created given value reference updated new instance isolating old object
Reference An object considered immutable state change constructed
Maximum reliance immutable object widely accepted sound strategy creating simple reliable code
Immutable object particularly useful concurrent application
Since change state corrupted thread interference observed inconsistent state
Programmers often reluctant employ immutable object worry cost creating new object opposed updating object place
The impact object creation often overestimated offset efficiency associated immutable object
These include decreased overhead due garbage collection elimination code needed protect mutable object corruption
The following subsection take class whose instance mutable derives class immutable instance
In give general rule kind conversion demonstrate advantage immutable object
An immutable object one modify create
A typical example string literal
A D programming language becomes increasingly popular notion immutability invariant keyword

String immutable class Java
An immutable class simply class whose instance modified
Why Java programming language choose make object class String immutable
This issue strongly connected notion mean instance class
In strict term class associated invariant predicate always hold true exit public method class
Such notion central ensuring inheritance example part
One pernicious issue Java difficult prevent client code breaking class invariant
For example consider following class If String immutable would possible user ZipCode call change character subsequent time thereby breaking invariant destroying conceptual integrity offered encapsulation ZipCode concept
Since kind integrity essential ensuring large system valid answer question really begs wider one Things like string date naturally value
In term expect copy constructor assignment operator equality operator never expect take address
Hence expect individually allocated heap
Virtual method make sense
Domain object naturally reference
one copy constructor assignment operator equality operator equal identical
We take address expect heap allocated
Methods generally virtual
Java value class reference one
Values faked immutable object
This true string unfortunately date
The mutability Java date caused frequent problem deprecated
Mutable value ca used basis hash example
Java designed allow execution subsection program code security constrained environment
The way requirement implemented setting SecurityManager thread given access parameter certain critical operation eg opening file asked whether operation allowed go ahead
If Java Strings mutable program could circumvent restriction creating two thread one performed open file operation would allowed modified string stored filename one would allowed
There possibility security manager would read original string accept operation would passed file opening code would precede open second permitted file
There two possible way preventing scenario The latter possibility would make operation run slowly would likely implementation contain bug using immutable string sensible decision
More generally immutable object useful allow sharing without needing make defensive copy may necessary even code prevent bug source data change even without requirement decision would still reasonable one

This question already answer I wrote following code immutable Strings
Output Here value variable changed many say content immutable object changed
But exactly one mean saying
Could please clarify topic
source This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
Before proceeding fuss let take look class functionality little coming conclusion
This work This usual creates string containing assigns reference
Simple enough
Lets perform function Lets see statement work This appends string
But wait possible since object immutable
Well surprise
When statement executed VM take value
appends giving u value
Now since immutable VM ca assign value creates new object give value give reference
An important point note object immutable So example reference made refer newly formed object
At point example two object first one created value pointed second one pointed
But technically three object third one literal statement
What another reference
We would lost
However still would existed would considered lost due reference
Look one example The reference variable still refers original
Almost every method applied object order modify creates new object
So object go
Well As application grow So order make Java efficient When compiler see literal look pool
If match found reference new literal directed existing new object created
The existing simply one reference
Here come point making object immutable In constant pool object likely one many reference
Well could say That reason nobody override behavior method
String immutable mean change object change reference object
When called actually changing reference new object created String literal
Changing object mean use method change one field field public final updated outside without accessing via method example While immutable class declared final prevent modification via inheritance method modify field also field always private recommended final example String change current String return new String You changing
Try You see refers changed
If want prevent code changing object refers try A string containing series offset array length
For example
It creates space string reference
Assigning copy reference around modify object reference refer
You also aware really anything useful
It merely creates another instance backed array offset length
There rarely reason considered bad practice Java programmer
Java double quoted string like really reference instance reference String instance regardless many time appears code
The hello creates one instance pooled creates instance
Try see immutable mean ca change value time required create new referance mean new memory location
ex code memory block storing first value abc second bcd second value replace first value
call immutable
In example variable reference instance string object
When say actually changing string object rather pointing reference entirely different instance string class
You changing object assignment statement one immutable object another one
Object change get discarded get written stead
In contrast represents object
You Here still point object object changed
You actually getting reference new string string changed immutable
This relevant
See An immutable object object whose state modified created
So immutable object
hold reference object
And another immutable object hold reference
Once assign string object object changed memory
In summary change reference new string object
This show string object create changed
EveryTime need create new put another String
S I think following code clear difference Java immutable Store value form object
u assign value create object value stored assigning value mean create another object store value want understand clearly check
see output This indicates whenever modifying content immutable string object new object created
allowed change content immutable object
address different object
Only reference changing
First referencing string later changed ty
The string remains
In example refers first
You mutating instance changing instance refers
For example print never mutate instance point
If object hold reference mutable object allow code change aspect change corresponding aspect state
Generally mean object encapsulate state using mutable object must ensure reference object exposed code might unexpectedly mutate
By contrast hold reference object us immutable aspect encapsulate state freely expose outside code without worrying anything outside code might
Hope code would clarify doubt Before String Concat Hello After String Concat Hello Before StringBuffer Append Hello After StringBuffer Append HelloWorld String immutable meant content String Object ca changeable want modify content use StringBuffer instead String mutable Probably every answer provided right answer specific use method prove point like String created ca modified modification result new value different memory location

I faced question one interview
I explained immutable mutable class
I know much mutable immutable also know exact answer
What key concept able distinguish two idea
Is performance impact chosing one
An immutable class mutable
You change
If x absolutely certain x never ever change ever least people abusing flexibility language every right tell go
A mutable class immutable
You change people change ca rely
It could changed another thread ca even sure state line line unless good locking
The ability alter state object key concept story end
You might want choose immutable class threaded environment need worry locking nobody write anyway
You might want choose immutable object large system ca certain nobody else handle input parameter wo change first chance get
You might want choose immutable object make reasoning behaviour code small unit possible everything function relies immutable data look function isolation guaranteed
There performance impact one way
Immutable object enable lot optimisation ca mutable data like aggressively sharing memory hey ca change aggressive inlining
Mutable data tends get performance increase need make lot change block memory
If interested seeing somewhere immutability really shine take look language like Haskell designed ground immutability enabling support thing like laziness lot optimisation
To properly define mutable immutable class one must first define mean object mutable
An object instance mutable possible mean via state encapsulated thereby might modified
An object instance immutable state possibly changed
An class immutable instance class guaranteed immutable regardless might hold reference
There certain approach like Reflection malicious code could modify anything discussion immutability focus thing code may legitimately regard Reflection trick illegitimate
Outside security application normal goal object work correctly client class behaves oddly client illegitimate thing client problem
Many discussion immutability ignore fact instance immutable class immutable instance mutable class immutable
Some discussion mutability suggest class really immutable field thereof must also immutable type
Not true many case would represent goal given absence immutable array type
What necessary immutable object must always certain reference mutable object hold state ever exposed code might mutate
Anything outside code might legitimately want encapsulated object must done method implemented behalf immutable containing object
It would helpful Java declarative mean specifying certain object despite mutable type never modified
Unfortunately feature exists
Despite major key writing correct efficient code knowing reference identify thing known immutable class one identify must immutable instance class one identify unshared mutable instance mutable class one fit none pattern generally identify entity
Many kind bug may obscure result using one kind reference though another
PS A framework may achieve efficiency robustness const validation without hassle const correctness Distinct storage type exist reference entity unrestricted reference value reference value reference immutable value Values cloneable cloning could largely automated type contained reference distinguished Members marked based upon whether invokable upon immutable reference Each object instance includes flag saying whether unrestricted reference may exist Any reference implicitly converted reference unrestricted reference also implicitly converted immutable reference making new immutable clone
A reference implicitly converted immutable making new immutable clone needed
A new mutable object may cloned reference
An essential aspect entity versus value distinction would object value either immutable single owner reference exists object control owner
Trying regain control reference might exist object ever freely exposed outside code would impossible mechanism would probably restrictive useful even thing worked like code could promise behave proper semantics even looked suspicious problem resulted would fault programmer breaking promise would significant advantage status quo
Not java I would recommend reading
This issue clear cut might think java
There inherent performance impact choosing one although impact performance depending upon exact usage
The key concept whether object changed
liable change
unchanging time unable changed
Ok definition
We know exactly word mean apply programming
Let u move two new definition
object liable change
object unchanging time unable changed
We directly use original definition put term object oriented programming
The final question I use practice
An immutable object must initialized upon construction rely upon immutable object initialized
I would like give clear picture understanding concept Mutable immutable class
Mutable mean whose value changed reverse true Immutable already told
Actually whenever calling constructor class actually allocating memory space type variable heap
Here I called constructor string class memory allocated variable value john reference code returned varible
In next statement also made pointing memory two println statement output value indicating variable pointing memory location
Now write code The moment write line new memory space string type data created heap value set monk reference returned hence pointing memory location hence get different hashcode value println statement
The reason String immutable class
So change value mean
For StringBuffer Class check mutability using code Used term primitive built type object user defined type
Immutable mean ca change value
Mutable mean change value
Many think primitive variable object variable final modifier front immutable however exactly true
Final almost mean immutable variable
Check link code sample

Immutable class mean object created change content
In Java wrapper class like String Boolean Byte Short String class immutable
We create immutable class well
Following requirement Class must declared final So child class created Data member class must declared final So change value object creation A parameterized constructor Getter method variable No setter To option change value instance variable Output In example created final class named Student
It two final data member parameterized constructor getter method
Please note setter method
In order make functional create object Student class main function

This newbie question I could find enough answer Google
What people mean say programming general OO programming specifically
Also mutable immutable state generally programming also specifically OOP
You state associate value number string complex data structure identity point time
For example number represent state number always natural number
As another example string HELLO sequence five character completely described character contains sequence appear
In five million year string HELLO still string HELLO pure value
In order state consider world pure value associated kind entity posse
Identity primitive idea mean distinguish two thing regardless property may
For example two car model colour two different car
Given thing identity attach property described pure value
car property blue
You describe fact associating pair car
The pair colour blue pure value describing particular car
State associated particular entity also particular point time
So say today car state Tomorrow I repainted black new state Note state entity change identity definition
Well long entity exists course car may created destroyed keep identity throughout lifetime
It make sense speak identity something exist yet
If value property attached given entity change time say state entity
Otherwise say state
The common implementation store state entity kind variable global variable object member variable
store state
Mutable state implemented using assignment assignment operation replaces previous snapshot new one
This solution normally us memory location store current snapshot
Overwriting memory location destructive operation replaces snapshot new one
find interesting talk approach
An alternative view subsequent state history entity stream possibly infinite sequence value see

In case snapshot stored different memory location program examine different snapshot time
Unused snapshot longer needed
State simply information something held memory
As simple exercise object orientation think class cookie cutter cooky object
You create cookie instantiate object using cookie cutter class
Let say one property cookie color changed using food coloring
The color cookie part state property
Mutable state state changed make object cookie
Immutable state state changed
Immutable object state changed become important dealing ability one processor computer operate object time
Immutability guarantee rely state stable valid object lifetime
In general state object held private member variable accessed property method
I think term state opposed concrete type state member variable useful comparing stateful API stateless one
Trying define state without mentioning APIs bit like trying define variable function without mentioning programming language correct answer make sense people already know word mean
For example OpenGL probably stateful API I know
If I may ludicrously oversimplify moment might say look something like Almost every function used pas state OpenGL need remember end call one anticlimactically simple function drawing
A stateless version oversimplified OpenGL would probably look like You often hear people say APIs le state easier reason
If keep argument count control I generally agree
As far I know distinction meaningful specify
For example using constructor It would hard implement window class remember size decide whether user able change window size creating
In OOP true state mean member variable lot
For instance method static variable lambda become closure capturing variable
In case variable persist across multiple call function thus probably qualify state
Local variable regular function may also considered state depending used one I main often count
The state
A condition mode regard circumstance
The state something set value attribute given moment
In OOP state object snapshot attribute value given moment
The state color blue price size small
If later You change one attribute also changed state whole since object longer
Sometimes class designed property value changed created
All value property either passed constructor read source like database file way change value moment since setter method way changing value inside object
That called state changed mutated
All destroy object create new one assing reference variable

Identify stakeholder keep mind writing
They evaluation report audience
Images Evaluations important process measuring improving performance
As owner undoubtedly performed enough evaluation business employee process become almost second nature
An evaluation report essentially formal documentation process
If evaluation client organization ask organization related report conducted past
Not report provide information addressed current evaluation also review see client expectation term formatting degree detail

Gather review data used conduct evaluation
While reviewing data idea report say conclusion presented

Identify key stakeholder report
These include read report stake finding
Stakeholders vary often include head organization client supplier financial backer employee
Because stakeholder audience keep question concern mind write report

Make note conclusion become apparent review data
As compile data write report normal new conclusion become apparent
Keep open mind let data shape report rather emphasizing data fit preconception goal stakeholder

Write heading Summary Executive Summary
This first section evaluation report usually written last
Use section summarize important point report completed section

Write Background section detailing reason evaluation performed
Highlight finding recommendation previous evaluation lead report

Write Scope section describing evaluated date evaluation performed

Write Reviewers section listing people organization performed evaluation

Write Evaluation Process section describing step taken evaluation listing tool resource used
If one evaluation performed process described separately

Write Evaluation section evaluation performed
These may different type evaluation subject different subject evaluated
For example one person may performed telephone interview website may analyzed
Other Appendix Evaluation section usually longest highly detailed

Write Recommendations section listing recommendation evaluation
While evaluation list recommendation summarize important recommendation succinct list easily read understood stakeholder

Write References section needed citing resource used conduct evaluation
This could include organization policy mission statement industry paper best practice

Write Appendix section needed includes data collected performing evaluation
This often one separate document including spreadsheet data

Proofread entire document finalize Summary section
Give draft copy reviewer ensure finding correctly documented printing final version report
A published author professional speaker David Weedmark advised business government technology medium marketing year
He taught computer science Algonquin College started three successful business written hundred article newspaper magazine throughout Canada United States

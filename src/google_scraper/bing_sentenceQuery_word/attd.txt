The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

Now together
This past week privilege participate annual conference Paris France
The city amazing meeting
As advocate people diabetes I found meeting captivating
First history ATTD conference Eight year ago group diabetes professional created present technological advance needed close loop create artificial pancreas delivers precise dos insulin based wearer sensor glucose value
Recognizing opportunity bring innovation wider audience Loop Club organizer Moshe Phillips Israel Tadej Battelino Slovenia started ATTD conference
Their goal bring together clinician researcher world learn advance prevent treat diabetes
The first ATTD meeting held Prague participant
Each year number increased country science progressed
Of course hundred meeting diabetes professional attend many similar theme goal
What make ATTD different focus new technology diversity clinician researcher industry representative travel far wide attend
The meeting brings together individual field diabetes endocrinology metabolism along general family medicine practitioner unites diabetes technology developer research institute industry
I love ATTD enables participant share experience expertise way make sometimes unexpected advance possible
During casual conversation colleague Brazil mentioned YouTube video Portuguese inject insulin view
Through extraordinary effort people found way video truly amazing
This led u contemplate online approach obesity treatment created could brought Brazil
Whether project happen uncertain assured thousand attendee countless conversation like one new exciting project never know one succeed change life people diabetes
The meeting started welcoming address noted French diabetologist asked Is technology
He made great case stating seems obvious many difficult technologist grasp
While attendance certainly agreed sentiment resonate throughout innovation pathway
These meeting primarily address patient perspective need better education support
Since founding principal company focus much professional life Reach comment truly resonated
As member ATTD organizing committee I glad ally bringing technology future conference
More importantly need redouble effort increase pressure provider health plan employer industry government pay education support help individual successfully prevent manage diabetes
One widest reaching aspect ATTD review top article past year comment chapter editor
While written healthcare professional might find editor comment particular interest
Free copy chapter found
The meeting yearbook included presentation following area The main topic discussion progress toward closing loop toward creation artificial pancreas subject addressed extensively others
You reader already know progress science typically happen rapidly
More commonly incremental advance combined get closer closer desired result
That exactly happening path artificial pancreas
Glucose sensor getting better
New insulin analogue development rapid acting
Devices smarter respect deliver insulin
Mathematical formula used predict patient future blood glucose refined
Slowly progress made creating technology essential patient able successfully use technology
Evidence emerging artificial pancreas improve glucose control
Reimbursement pump sensor platform upon artificial pancreas built slowly becoming reality country
All element many others beginning come together make artificial pancreas reality near future
Right precise estimate artificial pancreas might ready every day get closer
A key paper presented year event included MD University Miami Miller School Medicine Miami FL provided update status replacement therapy indicating expects clinical trial range new approach started soon
Approaches include animal derived cell cell reprogrammed genetically produce insulin cell biopsied patient organ
liver manipulated becoming beta cell given back individual islet derived human embryonic stem cell
PhD York University Toronto Canada presented interesting study people type diabetes two week high intensity interval training minute bout second rest period total minute equaling minute week glucose lower control group
Average glucose also lower muscle biopsy showed marker efficiency muscle glucose metabolism improved
Little et J Appl Physiol I presented paper colleague computer assisted support CASM diabetes showed improved health compared usual care
The program studied people diabetes randomized usual care CASM high low intensity Glasgow et
High intensity CASM included aspect feedback reward relapse prevention
Regular CASM included thing like psychosocial support goal setting tracking
Although trial patient use tool decreased six month
Use tool improve health impact small although enough meaningful public health impact
The key success tailored education integration primary care link community resource
Drs
University Children Hospital Ljubljana Slovenia MD Tel Aviv University Petah Tikva Israel MD Kinderkrankenhaus auf der Bult Hannover Germany presented referring recent February
The project approach bringing overnight control home environment comprised feasibility study DREAM inpatient overnight study DREAM overnight study diabetes camp DREAM overnight home study DREAM
The control algorithm seek emulate way master diabetes clinician make insulin treatment decision
The team presented DREAM result interim DREAM result
Patients better night overnight closed loop compared insulin pump glucose sensor closed loop
MD Sansum Diabetes Research Institute Santa Barbara CA presented status presenting variety approach accelerating insulin delivery
He mentioned BD developing disposable subcutaneous insulin pump well intradermal studying spreading agent injection time infusion set change separately injected insulin Roche enact European launch port enables Spirit pump deliver insulin abdomen MannKind studying inhalable Technosphere insulin aka pivotal trial type type diabetes developing product heat site insulin infusion insulin injection improve absorption Novo Nordisk initiating phase trial version insulin aspart FIAsp conducting preclinical study insulin analog use artificial amino acid
MD International Diabetes Center Park Nicollet Minneapolis MN presented receptor agonist consistently outperform agent aggregate metric percentage patient achieve without weight gain hypoglycemia Zinman et Diabetes Obes Metab Bergenstal et Diabetes Obes Metab
According proposed quality performance standard diabetes management Accountable Care Organizations would evaluated based percentage patient meet target five blood pressure LDL cholesterol smoking taking aspirin
One recurrent theme source frustration many u rapid pace innovative product able get patient outside United States
For example Medtronic combined insulin pump glucose sensor available Europe since yet approved FDA hopefully soon
This first system LGS feature automatically suspends insulin delivery hour sensor sugar low mitigating hypoglycemia without increasing high blood sugar level
This one example many promising diabetes treatment available patient
There widespread fear costly many company researcher responsible future innovation choice abandon market
I hope come true since would truly hurt chance improve care outcome
It belief market eventually force FDA nimble already taking step direction taking part new partnership called aim develop better tool evaluating medical technology quickly
All meeting great place learn recent advance share colleague reminisce past innovation improved life people diabetes contemplate future innovation improve life
I happy report spirit innovation life despite many roadblock created rigor science regulatory process lookout new novel us technology make preventing managing diabetes easier effective

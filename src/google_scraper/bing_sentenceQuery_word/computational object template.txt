Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I reading specific field probabilistic programming trying understand term stateful computation mean
See search XRP Stateful computation basically mean model computation got memory storage store information us information compute
For example let u say function f computing something using state information
Then f f f may different
In function defined mapping set theory function returning different value different call
We need define something like f x case
A sample code f stateful given
This function return sequence called multiple time
Here store memory storage us compute differently
The function also use input compute output event event queue input data interactive data etc
stateful computation must assume underlying saving state model computation
By way model computation computer Turing Machine thought stateful computation use function subroutine start Turing machine beginning every function call

What precise definition computational object SICP
Is value
Is expression
Its quite clear could please tell correct meaning explain
Could please give example explanation
I trying make sense terminology used SICP drawing concept map see I got stuck meaning computational object I decide whether term refers value expression
EDIT Updated Concept Map reading answer I think key text underlined A critical aspect programming language mean provides using name refer computational object
We say name identifies whose object
A computational object anything value variable
Calling computational object oppposed simply object probably add bit confusion since probably clear context object piece paper ca value variable program
There thing related program computational object either though
For instance Scheme variable computational object ca store variable another variable
In language variable pointer least computational object value variable
In definition text see source code expression
Evaluating expression produce computational value stored variable
For instance expression evaluated produce integer two get printed
It interesting note though Lisp language generally homoiconic language source code also represented value
For instance evaluating expression produce list symbol named integer value two integer value three
The list printed
So got idea object used object actually exist
This depends definition language
The definition Scheme specifies type object Other language provide type Scheme may provide I listed
The point object exist something decided language designer intent give enough primitive type programmer define whatever need term
I think term computational differentiate object physical object
In concept map might value
Note almost anything object manipulated Scheme including expression
By posting answer agree

In representing collection question might able solve
For example problem computational problem
Computational problem one main object study theoretical computer science
The field study method solving computational problem efficiently
The complementary field attempt explain certain computational problem intractable computer
A computational problem viewed infinite collection together every instance
For example factoring problem instance integer solution prime number describe nontrivial prime factor
It conventional represent instance solution binary namely element
For example number represented binary string using binary encoding
For readability identify number binary encoding example
A computational problem answer every instance either yes
An example decision problem A decision problem typically represented set instance answer
For example primality testing represented infinite set In answer arbitrary string
For example factoring search problem instance string representation positive integer solution string representation collection prime
A search problem represented consisting pair called
For example factoring represented relation consist pair number nontrivial prime factor
A asks number solution given search problem
For example counting problem associated factoring A counting problem represented function nonnegative integer
For search relation counting problem associated function An asks finding best possible solution among set possible solution search problem
One example problem Optimization problem represented search relation
In single output expected every input output complex yes
One famous example problem It problem important
In usually implicitly assumed string represents instance computational problem question
However sometimes string represent valid instance one specifies proper subset set valid instance
Computational problem type called
The following example decision promise problem Here valid instance graph whose maximum independent set size either least
Decision promise problem usually represented pair disjoint subset
The valid instance
represent instance whose answer respectively
Promise problem play important role several area including

address following question When use computer solve problem I would call numerical calculation experiment theory
Or something else
It common question
One come drinking beer scientist variety field
I think important topic discus order help everyone understand nature science
If agree fundamental idea science discussion role computational science
Let give following brief overview science Science model
We look something real life try make model
We use model predict future new event real life
If model agree real data change model
Repeat forever
OK I need define model
That hard
A model really anything used represent real life real life
Here example scientific model So model many different thing
It mathematical often see science
Hopefully thing already agree
One final note nature science
The process making model would theoretical physic
Comparing model real world stuff would experimental physic
A scientist theoretical experimental big project like High Energy Physics human tend focus either model building model testing
Now let pretend meeting
We going meet physic professor specializes creating computational model different thing really could anything
This professor lab consists lot computer
There probably pretty powerful computer cluster lab
Now conversation computational physicist
Here key point brought
Just every computational scientist say thing
When write computer program indeed give number end
Also true always know value look like actually run program
This mean like real experiment
In end program made human real life
Oh solve differential equation everyone would agree would fall theoretical science also know going get solution
No one call experiment
OK favorite model
What happens put mass end spring displace little bit
Yes oscillate back forth
mass spring let skip end
This plot two solution mass solving differential equation one numerical model point
Yes look like data
If I make smaller step numerical calculation ca even tell difference two theoretical solution
Here another plot better numerical model
I shifted one plot right top
Those two model pretty much give identical result
Ask computer program something experimental theoretical
Is something something completely different
If agree definition nature science Is computer program building testing model
Yes correct answer computer program building model part science
You still test model comparing experiment
If test real world data might well video game
Please think I suggesting stop calling people computational physicist
Creating numerical model fairly difficult requires unique set skill
It OK group people specialize process numerical model building
We also people specialize experimental high energy physic well theoretical solid state physic
But science still building testing model
In fact I think past scientist focused computational technique difficult battle
Other scientist claimed really science computer programmer
It took time legitimize computational technique
But place every field us numerical calculation way
No one think silly
Along I make claim including numerical calculation introductory tool accessible
Keeping coding physic class would like saying going problem involve fraction
Yes I really think

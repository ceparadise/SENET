I read internet I got point say Interfaces used But I able understand interface usefull point
let consider I creating basic without generic repository So interface come picture
suppose created interface upcasting used
Please explain precisely also usefullness Interface regard Repository Pattern
So interface come picture
Like could many implementation like As see really important implement repository
What important repository implementation respect defined contract interface posse method returning list employee
And controller us interface
See controller longer depends specific implementation repository
All need know implementation respect contract
Now need configure favorite dependency injection framework use implementation wish
Here example done Ninject In generated code simply decide use EF implementation single line code This way longer need manual instantiation repository class worry upcasting whatever
It dependency injection framework manages take care injecting defined implementation controller constructor
And simply modifying configuration could switch data access technology without touching single line code controller
That way unit testing isolation also come play
Since controller code weakly coupled repository thanks interface introduced need unit test provide mock implementation repository allows define behavior
This give possibility unit test Index controller action without dependency database whatever
Complete isolation
I also invite checkout TDD DI MVC
You would expose repository interface This would allow many different interface default one Or test one Your code consuming repository interested using interface The secret sauce factory another mechanism resolve interface usable type Dependency Injection framework Ninject Castle Windsor fulfil role
The point interface
This allows swap implementation testing purpose easily promotes loose coupling
Just clarify link use interface repository pattern specifically another pattern make use

So I following basic interface request handler These RequestHandlers different way handle incoming request whether come SMS Email whatever
Now problem handler save data different repository Database flatfile online storage
I like make easier manage data various repository injecting data storage various handler share repository
However repository us different connection parameter etc
What kind pattern suitable
Factory pattern seems like I I entirely sure
I would say create another IDataRepository interface handle saving operation multiple implementation DB file whatever
And Request handler depend interface
And every repository implementation care connection string
Something like And configure Dependency Injection container provide correct implementation repository
This way Handlers coupled connection string way giving better testability application architecture
And use factory pattern getting pretty much replaced DI container
I think looking dependency injection every handler use dependency injection container get whatever resource need
Going bit simpler without using full DI could make manages access actual repository
So would feel free invent better name method etc
return appropriate repository
During construction handler would need pas single repository repository

By Reviewed Murray Anderegg Computer Services recommends Subversion Git CVS code repository
Computer Services still maintains CVS source code control system limited expertise answering question CVS
This page give brief introduction CVS including CVS repository need one creation CVS repository access CVS repository much space user get CVS repository repository available Computer Science Department
The book available
Other information available online recommendation good source welcome
The process getting started CVS may take bit time plan try CVS repository read online documentation get speed
Record keeping became necessary people wanted compare program current state point past
For example normal course implementing new feature developer may bring program thoroughly broken state probably remain feature mostly finished
Unfortunately time someone usually call report bug last publicly released version
To debug problem may also exist current version source program brought back useable state
Restoring state pose difficulty source code history kept CVS
The developer simply say effect Give program three week ago perhaps Give program time last public release
If never kind convenient access historical snapshot may surprised quickly come depend
Personally I always use revision control coding project saved many For collaboration CVS assumes developer equal status project provides ability check copy project modify check copy independently
At check CVS check file committed one currently repository case conflict alert developer conflict
When conflict second person committing resolve conflict repository accept new code
To create CVS repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department
Personal CVS repository created CVS server project repository created CVS server project name
After repository space created necessary initialize repository CVS
Login CVS server run cv repository directory init This create CVSROOT initialize file CVSROOT directory
If wish run multiple CVS repository CVS repository directory need run init command inside repository subdirectory
For example mkdir cv init mkdir cv init Access CVS repository currently ONLY using SSH
We strongly suggest use key authentication SSH prompted password file committed
This make process committing CVS change atomic le painful
A document describing setup key authentication Linux Windows available
The CVS repository currently residing Linux server filesystem running POSIX draft file ACLs
The process sharing repository collaborating others require modifying ACLs
For information Linux file ACLs see man page setfacl getfacl see two web page
Here example adding user anderegg repository
You need set extended ACLs repository Login cv cd repository setfacl user anderegg rwX
setfacl user anderegg rwX
To remove access user anderegg cd repository setfacl user anderegg
setfacl user anderegg
NOTE Both command need run make change permission everything existing without everything created future default
There cron job sweep repository performs chown owner repository everything within case different user creates file within repository
Users allocated space personal CVS repository
Projects allocated space CVS repository
The department offer recommends two repository manager Subversion Git
These repository manager generally robust CVS

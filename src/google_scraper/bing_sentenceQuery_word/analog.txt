Have ever sat phone waiting ring
Well I guess sit phone anymore since carry u wherever go
Regardless anticipation great news probably looked phone mumbled ring
When telephone finally rang answered connecting individual good news end
As speak microphone sound wave voice transmitted telephone form radio wave sound wave radio wave combined begin moving data along telephone line
We come back good news minute first let define analog digital signal discus happens conversation
An continuous wave denoted sine wave pictured may vary signal strength amplitude frequency time
The sine wave amplitude value seen higher lower point wave frequency time value measured sine wave physical length left right

The sound human voice analog sound wave continuous vision see various shape color continuous manner due light wave
Even typical kitchen clock hand moving continuously represented analog signal
A must computer processing described using binary therefore take fractional value
As illustrated graphic digital signal retain uniform structure providing constant consistent signal
Because inherent reliability digital signal technology using rapidly replacing large percentage analog application device
For example wristwatch showing time day minute hour sweeping second hand replaced digital watch offer time day information using numerical display

In word two modem required perform demodulation modulation transformation
When call returned digital signal received telephone company telecommunication network pass telephone line modem signal modulated converted analog

ack late one exciting thing could watch
Instead trying figure time slowly rotating hand watch simply read number digital display
Since got used idea digital technology
Now pretty much everything seems digital television radio music player camera cellphone even book
What difference analog digital technology
Which best
Let take closer look
People accept digital thing easily enough often thinking computerized perhaps even worth trying understand
But concept analog technology often seems people try explain page like
So
If analog watch tell time hand sweep around dial position hand time
How much hand move directly related time
So hour hand sweep across two segment dial showing twice much time elapsed compared moved one segment
That sound incredibly obvious much subtle first seems
The point hand movement dial way passing time
It thing time representation time
The true measure something ruler
If measure length finger mark surface wooden ruler little strip plastic looking small segment ruler length finger
It finger representation finger another analogy
That really term analog mean
Until started dominate science technology early decade century virtually every measuring instrument analog
If wanted measure little pointer moving dial
The pointer moved dial higher current circuit
The pointer analogy current
All kind measuring device worked similar way seismograph machine
However analog technology measuring thing using dial pointer
When say something analog often simply mean digital job information handle involve processing number electronically
An sometimes referred example analog technology
You capture image piece transparent film coated chemical react
When film developed chemically processed lab used print representation scene photographed
In word picture get scene wanted record
The true recording sound cassette recorder
The recording make collection area long reel plastic tape
Together represent sound originally heard
Digital entirely different
Instead storing word picture sound representation thing like plastic film magnetic tape first convert information number digit display store number instead
Many scientific instrument measure thing digitally automatically showing reading instead using analog pointer dial
multimeters measuring electric current voltage bathroom scale common measuring device likely give instant digital reading
Digital display generally quicker easier read analog one whether accurate depends measurement actually made displayed
All kind everyday technology also work using digital rather analog technology
example transmit receive call converting sound person voice number sending number one place another form
Used way digital technology many advantage
It easier store information digital form generally take le room
You need several shelf store vinyl analog put amount music pocket
Electronic book ebook reader similar typically store couple thousand shelf space smaller single paperback
Digital information generally secure cellphone conversation easy information numeric form begin
You also edit play digital information easily
Few u talented enough redraw picture Rembrandt Leonardo slightly different style
But anyone edit photo digital form program work manipulating number image rather image
Just digital technology advantage mean always better analog
An analog watch might far accurate digital one us movement measure time passing sweeping second hand represent time precisely digital watch whose display show hour minute
Surprisingly analog watch also keep time better quartz one variation mechanical analog watch tend cancel one another electronic quartz watch tend compound one another
Generally expensive watch world analog one course partly people prefer way look though world accurate show time digital display
One interesting question whether information stored digital form last long analog information
Museums still paper document one written clay stone thousand year old first email cellphone conversation
Open book history see reproduction early photo taken Niepce Daguerre
But wo see picture first digital photo even though much recent probably know took
Lots people cherish plastic decade old attache importance disposable music file
A lot information recorded early device completely impossible read newer computer even floppy disk commonplace recently impossible read modern computer longer floppy drive
That though future may digital analog technology always place
It easy convert analog information digital every time make digital photo record sound computer speak
The process called informally
Sampling simply mean measuring regular interval easiest understand example
Let suppose I talking cellphone
The voice really wave travel air phone convert electrical signal
The sound wave signal continuously varying analog look like upper graph diagram
A cellphone transmits sound digital form analog wave need converted number
How happen
A circuit inside phone called analog digital converter measure size wave many time second store measurement number
You see middle figure I turned first graph approximate bar chart
If bar represents one second time represent chart nine number one number height bar
So sampling measuring sound wave per second successfully turned analog sound wave digital information
We could send number air radio wave another phone would run process reverse turn number back sound could hear
But see problem
Some information going get lost process converting sound digital back measurement I made precisely capture shape original wave crude approximation
What I
I could make measuring sound wave twice often
That mean doubling called
Now see bottom chart I get twice many measurement sound wave represented eighteen number
The I increase sampling rate accurate digital representation sound digital information I create space I need store
When download digital music might given option downloading track called different
Broadly speaking bit rate amount information captured time music sampled
So higher bit rate mean information captured analog information turned digital information accurately
music track may higher bit rate track take far space computer take longer download
Typically music digitally converted CDs track sampling rate time per second
Why high rate
For technical reason I wo go sampling rate need twice highest frequency sound wave since human hearing limited suggests need sampling rate least
The typical bit rate track around binary digit bit per second though higher quality track bit rate bit per second

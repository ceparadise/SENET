In single operation defined processor
The size length instruction varies widely little many multiple VLIW system
Most modern processor used instruction size bit
In architecture especially instruction fixed length typically corresponding architecture
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifying operation performed add content memory register zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous operation operand specified single instruction
Instructions rarely specified using form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
There another general definition instruction related processor An instruction may representation element executable

In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus

In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory

Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In case branch Instructions use addressing
But I really clear said book MIPS address calculating branch target actually relative address following instruction opposed current instruction
Anybody please explain
Thanks
This question came site computer enthusiast power user
Branch instruction MIPS offset value provide offset byte
This offset added Next PC value rather PC branch
Why NPC used rather PC branch obvious
This may related use Stanford MIPS project assembler performed limited instruction reordering filling delayed branch slot previous instruction
With design offset forward branch branch positive offset commonly used implement conditionally branching clause would never changed conversion offset backward branch branch negative offset commonly used loop would changed delay slot filled extra instruction
This might simplify compiler development
An alternative speculation would slightly simplified initial implementation branch evaluated second pipeline stage current PC NPC relative branch instruction
A third speculation considered conceptually cleaner given use delayed branch slot
The offset becomes relative instruction branch activated
As comment say probably easier fit add displacement target increment PC sub step instruction execution one done early
This wo make much difference reach forward somewhat greater backwards might affect corner case
In case I met assembler
implemented long branch equal By posting answer agree

A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

All computer software built set instruction
Instructions encoded binary
The cycle sequence step CPU follows process instruction
Most programmer write sequence digit
They use programming language like Java Ruby BASIC Python
These also known

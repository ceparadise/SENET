What symbol mean Load Symbol List
Or example MSDN let begin conditional directive testing symbol symbol see evaluate true
Where symbol defined declared
For Load Symbol List symbol defined element syntax programming language
A local variable name symbol
A class type identifier symbol
PDB file contain symbol information debugger know thing reside name original source code
For symbol mean preprocessor conditionally defined C symbol
C preprocessor phase term little confusing
You define conditional symbol using define You test whether symbol defined using Preprocessor symbol typeless generally intersect type identifier actually part program code
The preprocessor sits source code
Preprocessor symbol exist compiled output take memory space runtime
Logically speaking compiler never see preprocessor syntax removed text reach compiler proper
Symbol fairly broad term computer science
Wikipedia article
However case looking preprocessor precompiler directive affect result compiling
In case symbol variable one symbol used like The Debug symbol evaluate code compiled Debug mode case code within block sent compiler
You also use creates symbol le set value
So undefined symbol evaluates whereas defined symbol evaluates You also add symbol use code remove built symbol
If use Visual Studio Properties project build tab
If use Visual Studio I would suspect symbol added command line compile program

In part responsible loading
It one essential stage process starting program place program memory prepares execution
Loading program involves reading content containing program instruction memory carrying required preparatory task prepare executable running
Once loading complete operating system start program passing control loaded program code
All operating system support program loading loader apart highly specialized computer system fixed set specialized program
typically loader instead code executes directly ROM
In order load operating system part specialized used
In many operating system loader permanently resident memory although operating system support may allow loader located region memory
In case operating system support virtual memory loader may actually copy content executable file memory rather may simply declare virtual memory subsystem mapping region memory allocated contain running program code content associated executable file
See
The virtual memory subsystem made aware page region memory need filled demand program execution actually hit area unfilled memory
This may mean part program code actually copied memory actually used unused code may never loaded memory
In loader
The Unix loader task include In loader function contained following Some operating system need adjust address pointer executable compensate variation address loading start
The operating system need relocating loader program always loaded location address space pointer absolute address rather offset program
Some example IBM mainframe descendant including mainframe
In descendant system privileged operating system facility called IEWFETCH internal component OS Supervisor whereas LOADER application perform many function plus Linkage Editor entirely external OS Supervisor although certainly us many Supervisor service
IEWFETCH utilizes highly specialized theoretically possible load relocate entire executable within one revolution DASD medium m maximum m average legacy rpm drive
For load module exceed track size also possible load relocate entire module without losing revolution medium
IEWFETCH also incorporates facility overlay structure facilitates running potentially large executables minimum memory model small KB version OS KB KB common
The OS always resident portion Supervisor formatted way compatible version IEWFETCH
Unlike normal executables OS nucleus scatter loaded part nucleus loaded different portion memory particular certain system table required reside initial KB table code may reside elsewhere
The system application named IEWL
IEWL main function associate load module executable program object module output say assembler compiler including automatic call library language function format may efficiently loaded IEWFETCH
There large number editing option conventional application commonly employed
The load module format includes initial text record followed immediately relocation control record text record followed instance text record relocation control record pair end module
The text record usually large relocation control record small IEWFETCH three relocation control record buffer fixed byte smaller relocation control record certainly possible byte maximum possible IEWL ensures limitation complied inserting additional relocation record required next text record necessary special case sequence record may text record relocation record control record text record
A special byte within relocation control record buffer used disabled bit spin communication area initialized unique value
The Read CCW relocation control record Program Controlled Interrupt bit set
The processor thereby notified CCW accessed channel via special exit
At point processor enters disabled bit spin loop sometimes called shortest loop world
Once byte changed initialized value processor instantaneously know reading relocation control record completed bit spin terminated relocation may proceed synchronously rotation medium relocation occurs gap within medium relocation control record next text record
If relocation text record completed NOP CCW changed TIC loading relocating proceed using next buffer
If channel encounter NOP CCW channel program terminate restarted IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit
The three buffer continuous circular queue pointing next last pointing first three buffer constantly reused loading relocating proceeds
IEWFETCH thereby load relocate load module practical size minimum possible time

A cluster combination group linked computer working together run common set application provide image single system client application
In word cluster working together many respect form single computer
The computer physically connected together cable programmatically connected cluster software
These connection allow computer use feature failover Server Clusters load balancing Network Load Balancing NLB cluster
Clusters normally provide improve performance availability network
What Network Load Balancing cluster
Network Load Balancing cluster single computer running Windows provide limited level server reliability scalable performance
Network Load Balancing cluster also provide scalability high availability TCP UDP service application combining server running Window Server Window Server Window Server single cluster
The job Network Load Balancing distributes incoming client across host cluster
The load weight flexible host configured change necessary
Network Load Balancing allows computer cluster addressed set unique dedicated cluster IP address host
Three type Cluster Parameter There three type cluster parameter consider configuring Network Load Balancing Cluster
The first cluster parameter Host parameter specific host Network Load Balancing cluster
The second cluster parameter Cluster parameter apply Network Load Balancing cluster whole
The third cluster parameter Port rule
Port rule control cluster function
By default port rule balance traffic across server
Some application may require different port rule operate action
One example need implement Network Load Balancing Remote Desktop Services need modify default rule
What Server Cluster
Server cluster provide high availability stateful application service allowing failover resource
Server cluster also maintain client connection application service
If application stateful frequent change data server cluster appropriate solution
Server cluster use Cluster service maintain data integrity provide failover support high availability application service server database file print service
Organization use server cluster make application data available multiple server linked together server cluster configuration
The different Network Load Balancing NLB Server Cluster After discussion Network Load Balancing NLB cluster Server Cluster found similarity functionality
I differentiate Server cluster Network Load Balancing cleaner view
Server cluster group server working together provide highly available single platform application
The application failed make sure availability event planned downtime due maintenance unplanned downtime due operating system application failure hardware
Server Clusters normally provide availability platform application Exchange Server data store file SQL Server print service
In word Server cluster use stateful application rely state context one request next
Network Load Balancing NLB cluster work dynamically distribute incoming TCP UDP traffic among cluster node according set traffic handling Load Balancing also used stateless application example build state result request
Network Load Balancing cluster provide scalablility high availability application ISA server IIS web server
There study needed
In conclusion Network Load Balancing server cluster used set server Microsoft Server cluster Network Load Balancing supported set network control configure network adapter interfere might occur
Network Load Balancing used load balancing client request traffic web server server cluster provide highly availability database access
http http http IIS Server Web Farm An IIS Server web farm common scenario used Network Load Balancing
There two example Network Load Balancing used service Web Farm
The first service Servicing Multiple Web Sites mean Network Load Balancing cluster used host multiple Web site different IP address
The additional IP address also added existing cluster
The second service Servicing web site active server page
Web site using Active Server Pages ASP maintain session state across client connection
Network Load Balancing help preserve client access session information ensuring connection single client directed cluster host
Cluster Server Cluster mean providing High Availability

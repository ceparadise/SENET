One biggest challenge breaking backlog knowing split work backlog right sized piece
I already talked concept I really addressed decision actually divide backlog make smaller
Most developer trying break backlog smaller chunk automatically head path using horizontal This tend think
What I mean horizontal slice
A horizontal slice basically slice feature backlog horizontally divide architecture
Most thing built way
If build house would probably start slicing project horizontally
You would first pour foundation
Then put wall
Then put roof many step leaving finishing work last
This thinking usually get applied breaking backlog Agile development
It would seem pretty silly build house finished one room completely time
There distinct difference though developing software Agile way building house
The big difference Agile software development true Agile development know exactly going build done building
With house rarely case
With house blueprint drawn ahead time
You know exactly wall outlet
You may even built house similar
When building software unless taking waterfall approach planning everything upfront know really building done
Before object statement consider Agile mean responding change
Building house expect customer say Hmm yeah I really like wall Actually I thinking going need bedroom In software development expecting statement analogous
Simply put building one room time
But functional
Who want house one room time
Correct
It functional house pour foundation change going rest room even knock wall start without incurring huge cost
The point building software one room time giving customer chance see product built way matter enables test
Sure going able live done
But ability step room envision furniture
Customers care foundation framed wall
As developer might able look foundation framed wall envision house look like customer worse yet tested
Vertical slicing software development taking backlog might database component business logic user interface breaking small stepwise progression step cut every slice
The idea instead breaking backlog following The backlog broken something like Because NOT easy
I going lie
It MUCH easier slice backlog horizontally
As developer tend think horizontal slicing plan implementation backlog
We tend want implement thing building one layer time
Thinking break apart backlog vertical slice requires u step outside understanding code implementation instead think backlog small piece working functionality
There almost always progression functionality found large backlog
What I mean almost always smaller step evolution functionality created order produce end result software development
Sometimes step required break backlog vertically going result bit waste
Sometimes going purposely create basic user interface know going redo part implement vertical slice
This OK
It better plan small amount rework build entire feature one horizontal slice time rework huge part feature planned
You might thinking sound like work without much benefit
So would I bother break backlog vertically
Is really important
I already hinted benefit slicing thing vertically
The true impetus behind vertical slicing cornerstone Agile methodology
It delivering working functionality soon possible
We going cover whole reasoning behind idea Agile development
I assuming already subscribe idea delivering working functionality soon possible important valuable
Based premise alone see horizontal slicing direct violation one Agile methodology core tenant
It interesting many people huge proponent breaking entire system functional piece delivered one piece time opposed micro scale dealing individual backlog item
If opposed I saying vertical slicing really ask whether truly subscribe idea applied larger level really difference
John Sonmez founder Simple Programmer life coach software developer
He best selling author book I think approach similar band jam session
Just playing along find nice chord progression drum pattern
But component never come software development theory discussion
And actual skill ability developer involved
It seems approach good team using skilled enough member actually think term functionality
How applied effectively team problem implementing actual code
Which happens often outsourcing company take whatever project find regardless technology tool implied use
That problem solved
Using example coaching help band composed player play instrument
Band member practice able contribute band
That super information
Thanks sharing
I going Tweet blog
Great post
In experience hardest part getting sort vertical development working changing development team mindset
Rather thinking cool add feature framework thinking I need feature framework complete feature I working
Ultimately also need developer good understanding SOLID implement principle without difficult developer implement vertical slice cost effective manner
Thanks post great site
Tobias Mayer said post come look
Right
Your welcome thanks checking
I agree totally
To extend analogy think housing developer setting new development
He lay foundation house building wall
He create one two completed show house vertical slice potential customer see example finished product
They may ask house different bedroom
Vertical slice allow whole housing development developed Agilely
Cheers Paul What action take developer ensure delivery vertical slice still give u highly maintainable extensible solution
I work company business solution developer application tend live decade getting right first time important
If move using vertical slicing make sure deliver solution business deems good enough left supporting year come
It easy see benefit shrink wrap solution speed market difference innovator imitator
I looking good way make apply software life cycle
Thanks
Great question
Two thing I would say
You release ready still beneficial develop vertical slice

Get feedback developing customer likely keep giving
In way also customer supporting feature required
Basically I saying vertical slicing way develop application solution better get feedback faster
You still control cadence release determine done
Don afraid wait solution make sure add future maintenance feature

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What work path exist identify reasonable vertical slice classic platform code base infrastructure enterprise size
Regardles refactor new solution I think approach le
So primary interested step definitioning module function test appproved vertical
To extend
I understand vertical actor kind business value
But communication system actor functional unit vertical slice
Probably yes And depends enterprise decide
Is shipment part Order Order Shipment different vertical
What vertical slice consist true vertical
In term Levels function like data store client configuration tool business intelligence calculation
Btw It requirement vertical deployed operatable independently
Maybe kind schema use
Is X used Y
Yes vertical
Is X used Z
Yes vertical
Is X depend funtion YY
If yes And
Links success story define vertical also interest
Tackling significant refactor requires solid understanding performing refactor
I rule hobby level justification make code pure improve stylistic expression similar
Those justification commercial project almost never see use level justification major undertaking
In contrast commercial level refactoring justification always involves pain
Pain justifies expense risk involved
And pain lead answer
You refactor order minimize future pain
Refactor order
You mentioned couple aspect communication system order shipment
And correctly called approach identify belongs
Every system different based upon domain business need
For system identify changing
Push vertical conforms contract API rest system
Whenever section change verify still meet contract control amount damage code change
The correct way may strictly horizontal vertical wavelet The key build layer software way easy user developer higher layer need spend much time redoing ought
The advantage reusable extended beyond software programming configuration image software license even hardware specification even standardized server machine designed reusability multiple business unit mind
The higher layer may need talk multiple functional unit get thing done
Consider issue customer support example
The blog post suggested talk writing software
When taking vertical slice approach one try satisfy small functionality requested single functional unit implementing smallest amount software
The blog post implies use lot UIs imperfect way meeting part functional requirement endurable implementation scheduled later project
The blog post talk refactoring existing enterprise software system
As implies working make risky change

Students asked sketch describe figure result slicing cylinder
This task implemented individually small group whole class
The student unable correctly describe figure result slicing figure
The student The student may also confuse term
What difference figure figure
Can give example
Do know mean
Can imagine cross section cylinder revealed slicing
Which way horizontal vertical
What parallel perpendicular mean
Review difference figure
Provide student example figure classified either
Ask student classify figure identify dimension
Consider implementing CPALMS Lesson Plan ID
This lesson guide student sketch describe figure resulting horizontal vertical slicing figure
Be sure student understands difference horizontal vertical parallel perpendicular
Model horizontal vertical slice
Define parallel perpendicular model parallel perpendicular slice relation base
If needed review feature cylinder emphasize base circle described diameter radius
If needed provide additional experience identifying drawing slice figure describing dimension
Consider implementing task ass student sketch describe cross section resulting slice
The student adequately describe dimension plane figure term dimension original figure
The student identify draw shape plane section What mean shorter Shorter
To part cylinder compare circle
How circle compare base cylinder
How diameter circle compare diameter base
What two dimension rectangle resulting slice
To part cylinder compare length width rectangle
Guide student relate dimension figure dimension original figure
Model concise comparison length rectangle equal height cylinder width equal diameter original circular base
Provide additional opportunity precisely describe cross section figure
The student provides complete correct response component task
The student correctly identifies draw plane figure resulting slice describes using specific dimension
For example student say Does slice middle halfway order horizontal vertical
Can horizontal slice close bottom top base cylinder
What happens dimension vertical slice get farther center cylinder
What happens dimension horizontal slice get farther center cylinder
Challenge student complex figure double cone slice neither parallel perpendicular base

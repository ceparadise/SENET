Outline architecture central processing unit CPU function arithmetic logic unit ALU control unit CU register within CPU
A major defining point history computing realisation data instruction manipulate data logically could stored place
The computer design built upon principle became known still basis computer today
Although name honour John von Neumann brilliant mathematician worked construction atomic bomb idea probably originated Presper Echkert John Mauchly two early pioneer worked ENIAC Moore School University Pennsylvania time period
Another major characteristic von Neumann architecture unit process information separate unit store information
This characteristic lead following component von Neumann architecture
Memory collection cell unique physical address
We use generic word cell rather byte number bit addressable location called memory varies one machine another
Today computer byte addressable
To fully illustrate concept memory take computer RAM example
The memory consists byte mean byte computer uniquely addressable machine bit
The cell memory numbered consecutively beginning
For example cell memory cell would addressed follows What content address
The bit pattern stored location
However content actually represents instruction value sign etc
discussed later
What important however understand bit pattern information interpreted
When referring bit byte word bit numbered right left beginning zero
The bit address numbered follows The capable performing basic arithmetic operation adding subtracting multiplying dividing two number
This unit also capable performing logical operation
The operates word natural unit data associated particular computer design
Historically word length computer number bit processed
However current Intel line processor blurred definition defining word length bit
The processor work word bit double word bit quadwords bit
In rest wiki referring word historical nature aforementioned
Most modern small number special storage unit called
These register contain one word used store information needed immediately
For example calculation
first added result multiplied
Rather storing result adding memory retrieving multiply result left register content register multiplied
Access register much faster access memory location
All computing power world would useful one could input value calculation outside report outside result said calculation
Input output unit channel computer communicates outside world
An device data program outside world entered computer
The first input unit interpreted hole punched paper tape card
input device however include limited keyboard mouse camera also known simply webcam scanning device
An device result stored computer memory made available outside world
Examples include printer screen monitor
The organising force computer charge
There two special register control unit
The contains instruction executed contains address next instruction executed
Because control unit work closely together often thought one unit called
Above simplified view flow information part von Neumann machine
The part connected one another collection wire called bus data travel computer
Each bus carry three kind information address data control
An address used select memory location device data go taken
Data flow bus CPU memory Devices
The control information used manage flow address data
For example control signal typically used determine direction data flowing either CPU
The number bit transfer simultaneously
The wider bus address data bit move
Explain use cache memory
Because memory access time consuming relative speed processor many architecture provide
Cache memory small amount memory copy frequently used data stored
Before main memory access made CPU check whether data stored cache memory
another technique used speed
This technique split instruction smaller step overlapped
In personal computer component von Neumann machine reside physically printed circuit board called
The motherboard also connection attaching device bus mouse keyboard additional storage device
So mean say machine processor
The variable usually refers number bit CPU general register Two number added single instruction
It also refer width bus size addressable always
In addition refer width data always
Explain machine instruction cycle
Before looking computer let u look
The definition computer outline capability computer electronic device store retrieve process data
Therefore instruction give computer relate storing retrieving processing data
The underlying principle von Neumann machine data instruction stored memory treated alike
This mean instruction data addressable
Instructions stored contiguous memory location data manipulated stored together different part memory
To start Cycle first data loaded main memory operating system address first instruction placed onto
The process cycle includes four step The increment one one point next instruction executed control unit go address memory address register hold address next instruction specified take main memory address bus return memory buffer register via data bus
The MBR two way register temporarily hold data fetched Memory cache RAM make copy content place copy
At point contains instruction executed
Before going next step cycle must updated hold address next instruction executed current instruction completed
There instruction register responsible instruction solved CU
CU check status instruction allows execution
Because instruction stored contiguously memory adding number byte current instruction put address next instruction
Thus control unit increment
It possible may changed later instruction executed
In case instruction must get additional data memory sends address memory bus memory responds returning value location
In computer data retrieved memory may immediately participate arithmetic logical operation
Other computer simply save data returned memory register processing subsequent instruction
At end execution result instruction may saved either register memory
To execute instruction instruction register control unit determine instruction
It might instruction access data input device send data output device perform operation data value
At phase instruction decoded control signal
That logic circuitry determines operation executed
This step show computer execute instruction expressed machine language
The instruction literally built circuit
The instruction executed may potentially require additional memory access complete task
For example instruction say add content memory location register control unit must get content memory location
Once instruction decoded operand data fetched control unit ready execute instruction
Execution involves sending signal unit carry processing
In case adding number register operand sent added content register
When execution complete cycle begin
If last instruction add value content register next instruction probably say store result place memory
However next instruction might control instruction asks question result last instruction perhaps change content program counter
Hardware changed dramatically last yet von Neumann model remains basis computer today
As Alan Perlis computer scientist said Describe primary memory
RAM stand Memory
RAM memory cell usually byte directly accessed
Inherent idea able access location ability content location
That storing something else place change bit pattern cell
In addition RAM computer contain second kind memory called ROM
ROM stand Memory
The content location ROM changed
Their content permanent altered second operation
Placing bit pattern ROM called
The bit pattern burnt either time ROM manufactured time computer part assembled
RAM ROM differentiated basic property RAM ROM
This mean RAM retain bit configuration power turned ROM
Because ROM stable changed used store instruction computer need start
Frequently used software also stored ROM system read software time machine turned
Main memory usually contains ROM along RAM
Identify need persistent storage
An input device mean data program entered computer stored memory
An output device mean result sent back user
Because main memory volatile limited essential type storage device program data stored longer processed machine turned
These type storage device main memory called storage device
Because data must read written storage device also input output device
Examples secondary storage device include Describe main function operating system
Outline use range application software
As early end first generation software development split programmer wrote tool help programmer used solve problem
Modern software divided two category system software application software reflecting separation goal
written address specific need solve problem real world
Word processing program game inventory control system automobile diagnostic program missile guidance program application software
manages computer system fundamental level
It provides tool environment application software created run
System software often interacts directly hardware provides functionality hardware
The computer core system software
An operating system manages computer resource memory device provides interface human interact computer
Other system software support specific application goal library graphic software render image display
The operating system allows application program interact system resource
The diagram illustrates operating system interacts many aspect computer system
The operating system manages hardware resource
It allows application software access system resource either directly system software
It provides direct user interface computer system
Recall executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another cycle
technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform keep track program memory memory reside
Another key operating system concept idea defined program execution
A program static set instruction
A process dynamic entity represents program executed
Through multiprogramming computer system might many active process
The operating system must manage process carefully
At point time specific instruction may next executed
Intermediate value calculated
A process might interrupted execution operating system performs carefully track progress process intermediate state
Related idea memory management process management need determines process memory executed CPU given point
One must remember however OS program must executed
Operating system process must managed maintained main memory along system software application program
The OS executes CPU program must take turn among
The following section Single Contiguous Memory Management Partition Memory Management Paged Memory Management interest purpose
The Computer Science Guide clearly note technical detail needed
For example memory management described handled multitasking environment expected
Therefore section serve purpose illustrating memory management technique summarised rather utilised exam
Has operating system one program memory one time
This basic type memory management
The memory broken different part
Has operating system number program running time different partition
The partition base bound register
Base register Bounds register Partition selection First fit Best fit Worst fit A technique process divided page stored memory frame loaded
Frame Page The number system specifies number digit used system
The digit always begin continue one le base
For example digit base
There digit base
There digit base
The base also determines position digit mean
When one add last digit number system one carry digit position left
Numbers written using
The rightmost digit represents value multiplied base zeroth power
The digit left one represents value multiplied base first power
The next digit represents value multiplied base second power
The next digit represents value multiplied base third power
One usually familiar positional notation even aware
One instinctively inclined utilise method calculate number one A formal way defining positional notation say value represented polynomial base number system
But polynomial
A polynomial sum two algebriac term consists constant multiplied one variable raised integral power
When defining positional notation variable base number system
Thus represented polynomial follows acting base To express idea formally number number system digit represented follows represents digit th position number Look complicated
Take concrete example base
Here number exactly digit base
The formula state fifth digit last digit left multiplied base fourth power fourth digit multiplied base third power In previous calculation one assumed number base
This logical assumption generic number system base
However reason number could represent value base
In order distinguish value general notation utilised order represent number base
Therefore number found base system
In order turn turn one simply us previous calculation Therefore base equal base
One must keep mind two number equivalent value
That represent number thing
If one bag contains bean second bag contains bean bag contain exact number bean
The number system allow one represent value various way
Note base rightmost digit one position
In base rightmost digit also one position
In fact true base anything raised power zero one
Why would anyone want represent value base
It done often granted sometimes helpful understand work
For example computing technique called hashing take number scramble one way scramble number interpret different base
Other base base binary particularly important computer processing
The binary number system particularly important computing
It also helpful familiar number system power ase base octal base hexadecimal
Recall base digit base two digit base eight digit
Therefore number could represent value base le digit exist base
It however valid number base base higher
Likewise number valid number base higher simply exist us digit base lower
What digit base higher
One need assign symbol represent digit correspond decimal value beyond
In base higher one generally look towards letter digit
The letter A consequently represent number B represent C represent forth
Therefore digit base Focusing value binary octal hexadecimal represent number base one calculate example decimal equivalent octal base simply put finding
As case expanding number polynomial form adding number And converting hexadecimal number decimal Define Boolean operator AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
Construct truth table using operator
The gate computer sometimes referred logic gate perform one logical function
That gate accepts one input value produce single output value
Because one dealing binary information input output either corresponding signal corresponding signal
The type gate input value determine output value
A NOT gate accepts one input value produce one output value
The table right illustrates NOT gate three way Boolean expression logical diagram symbol using truth table
In representation variable represents input signal either
The variable represents output signal whose value determined value
By definition input value NOT gate output input value output
A NOT gate sometimes referred inverts input value
In Boolean expression NOT operation represented mark value begin negated
Sometimes operation shown horizontal bar value begin negated
In Boolean expression table assigned value determined applying NOT operation input value
In variable left equal sign take value expression side
The logical diagram symbol NOT gate triangle small circle called end
The input output shown line flowing gate
Sometimes line labeled though always
The truth table show possible input value NOT gate well corresponding output value
Because one input signal NOT gate signal two possibility column labelled A truth table
The column labelled show output gate inverse input
Note three representation truth table actually defines behaviour gate situation
These three notation different way representing thing example result Boolean expression always result Boolean expression always
This behaviour consistent value shown truth table
Unlike NOT gate accepts one input signal AND gate accepts two input signal
The value input signal determine output signal
If two input value AND gate output otherwise output
The AND operation Boolean algebra expressed using single dot case asterisk
Often operator assumed example often written
Because two input two possible value input four possible combination provided input AND gate
Therefore four situation occur AND operator used Boolean expression
Likewise truth table showing behaviour AND gate four row showing four possible input combination
Like AND gate two input OR gate
If two input value output value otherwise input
The Boolean algebra OR operation expressed using plus sign
The OR gate two input one two value AND gate four input combination therefore four row truth table
The XOR OR gate illustrated right
An XOR gate produce two input otherwise
Note difference XOR gate OR gate differ one input situation
When input signal OR gate produce XOR produce
Sometimes regular OR gate referred OR produce either input
The XOR produce input mixed one one
Think XOR gate saying When I say I mean one
The Boolean algebra symbol sometimes used express XOR operation
However XOR operation also expressed using operator leave exercise
Note logic diagram symbol XOR gate like symbol OR gate except extra curved line connecting input signal
The NAND NOR gate accept two input value
The NAND NOR gate essentially opposite AND OR gate respectively
That output NAND gate one took output AND gate put inverter NOT gate
There typically specific symbol used express NAND NOR gate operation Boolean algebra
Instead one rely definition express concept
That Boolean algebra expression NAND negation AND operation
Likewise Boolean algebra expression NOR negation OR operation
The logic diagram symbol NAND NOR AND OR except NAND NOR symbol inversion bubble indicate negation
Compare output column truth table AND NAND
They opposite row row
The true OR NOR gate
Six specific type gate observed
It may seem difficult task keep straight remember work
Well probably depends one think
One encouraged try memorise truth table
The processing gate described briefly general term
If one think way one produce appropriate truth table time needed
Some description term input value cause gate produce n output case produce Construct logic diagram using AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
A combinational circuit consists logic gate whose output determined time present combination input irrespective previous consists input variable logic gate output variable
The logic gate accept signal input generate signal example combinational circuit binary adder decimal adder decoder multiplexer half adder half subtractor etc
A logic circuit addition two number called half adder
addition process reproduced truth table

You problem
Your closet overflowing spilling shoe shirt underwear onto floor
You think It time get Now two problem
Specifically first need decide keep second arrange
Fortunately small industry people think twin problem living happy offer advice
On keep Martha Stewart say ask question How long I
Does still function
Is duplicate something I already
When last time I wore used On organize keep recommends grouping like thing This look like good advice
Your closet present much challenge computer face managing memory
Except another larger industry professional also think obsessively idea
Your closet present much challenge computer face managing memory space limited goal save money time
For long computer computer scientist grappled dual problem keep arrange
The result decade effort reveal advice toss Martha Stewart actually make several different fully compatible much critical others
The computer science memory management also reveals exactly closet office ought arranged
At first glance computer appear follow Martha Stewart maxim grouping like thing Operating system encourage u put file folder like like forming hierarchy branch content become ever specific
But tidiness scholar desk may hide messiness mind apparent tidiness computer file system obscure highly engineered chaos data actually stored underneath veneer
What really happening called caching
Caching play critical role architecture memory underlies everything layout processor chip millimeter scale geography global Internet
It offer new perspective various storage system memory bank human machine also office library even closet
Starting roughly around anyone market new computer encountered particular conundrum choosing storage option
They must make tradeoff size speed
The computer industry currently transition hard disk drive drive price point hard disk offer dramatically greater capacity drive offer dramatically better performance
What casual consumer may know exact tradeoff made within machine number point considered one fundamental principle computing
In Arthur Burks Herman Goldstine John von Neumann working Institute Advanced Study Princeton laid design proposal called electrical memory In ideal world wrote machine would course limitless quantity storage practice possible
It still
A Killer Home Organization System Inspired Bees Some Can Draw Bikes From Memory
Some Definitely Can Here How Clean Up Your Gmail Inbox You Hoarder Instead trio proposed believed next best thing hierarchy memory greater capacity preceding le quickly By effectively pyramid different form small fast memory large slow could somehow get best
In computing idea memory hierarchy remained theory development supercomputer Manchester England called Atlas
Its principal memory consisted large drum could rotated read write information unlike wax phonograph cylinder
But Atlas also smaller faster working memory built polarized magnet
Data could read drum magnet manipulated ease result written back drum
Shortly development Atlas Cambridge mathematician Maurice Wilkes realized smaller faster memory convenient place work data saving
It could also used deliberately hold piece information likely needed later anticipating similar future dramatically speeding operation machine
If needed still working memory load drum
As Wilkes put smaller memory automatically accumulates word come slower main memory keep available subsequent use without necessary penalty main memory access incurred The key course would managing small fast precious memory looking often possible
Wilkes proposal implemented IBM supercomputer later acquired name Since cache appeared everywhere computer science
The idea keeping around piece information refer frequently powerful used every aspect computation
Processors cache
Hard drive cache
Operating system cache
Web browser cache
And server deliver content browser also cache making possible instantly show video cat riding vacuum cleaner million


But getting ahead bit
Knowing exactly need something easier said done
The story computer past year painted one exponential growth year referencing part famously accurate Moore Law prediction made Intel Gordon Moore number transistor CPUs would double every two year
What improved rate performance memory mean relative processing time cost accessing memory also increasing exponentially
A factory double manufacturing speed number part shipped overseas sluggish mean little factory twice idle
For seemed Moore Law yielding little except processor twiddled thumb ever faster ever time
In began known memory Computer science best defense hitting wall ever elaborate hierarchy cache cache cache way
Modern consumer laptop tablet smartphones order memory hierarchy managing memory smartly never important computer science today
So let start first question come mind cache closet matter
What get full
When cache fill obviously going need make room want store anything else computer science making room called cache replacement cache As Wilkes wrote Since cache fraction size main memory word preserved definitely must wired system algorithm progressively These algorithm known replacement policy eviction policy simply caching algorithm
IBM seen played early role deployment caching system
Unsurprisingly also home seminal early research caching perhaps important László Les Bélády
Bélády paper caching algorithm would become cited piece computer science research fifteen year
As explains goal cache management minimize number time find looking cache must go slower main memory find known page fault cache The optimal cache eviction essentially definition Bélády cache full evict whichever item need longest
Of course knowing exactly need something easier said done
While caching began scheme organizing digital information inside computer clear applicable organizing physical object human environment
The hypothetical prescient algorithm would look ahead execute optimal policy known today tribute Bélády Algorithm
Bélády Algorithm instance computer scientist call clairvoyant algorithm one informed data future
It necessarily crazy case system might know general clairvoyance hard come software engineer joke encountering implementation difficulty try deploy Bélády Algorithm practice
So challenge find algorithm come close clairvoyance get time stuck firmly present guess lie ahead
We could try Random Eviction adding new data cache overwriting old data random
One startling early result caching theory far perfect approach half bad
As happens cache make system efficient regardless maintain
Items use often end back cache soon anyway
Another simple strategy FIFO evict overwrite whatever sitting cache longest Martha Stewart question How long I
A third approach Least Recently Used LRU evicting item gone longest untouched Stewart When last time I wore used
It turn two mantra Stewart suggest different policy one suggestion clearly outperforms
Bélády compared Random Eviction FIFO variant LRU number scenario found LRU consistently performed closest clairvoyance
The LRU principle effective something computer scientist call temporal locality program called particular piece information likely near future
Temporal locality result part way computer solve problem example executing loop make rapid series related read writes emerges way people solve problem
If working computer might switching among email web browser word processor
The fact accessed one recently clue likely thing equal program using longest time also probably one used time come
The literature eviction policy go deep one algorithm account frequency well recency use algorithm track time access rather last one
But despite abundance innovative caching scheme beat LRU right condition LRU minor tweak overwhelming favorite computer scientist used wide variety deployed application variety scale
LRU teach u next thing expect need last one needed thing need probably one
And last thing expect need one already gone longest without
Unless good reason think otherwise seems best guide future mirror image past
The nearest thing clairvoyance assume history repeat
While caching began scheme organizing digital information inside computer clear applicable organizing physical object human environment
When spoke John Stanford University pioneering computer architect helped develop modern caching immediately saw link Caching obvious thing time
I mean amount information I get


certain thing I keep track right bunch thing I desk thing filed away eventually filed away university archive system take whole day get stuff I wanted
But use technique time try organize life
The direct parallel problem mean potential consciously apply solution computer science home
First deciding keep throw away LRU potentially good principle much better FIFO
You necessarily toss college still wear every
But plaid pant worn age
Those somebody else bonanza
Second exploit geography
Make sure thing whatever cache closest place typically used
This concrete recommendation book consistently turn scheme actual people describe working well
I keep running exercise gear crate floor front coat closet say one person quoted Julie Morgenstern Organizing Inside Out instance
I like close front After deciding keep go final challenge knowing organize
A slightly extreme example appears book William Jones A doctor told approach keeping thing
My kid think I whacky I put thing I think I need later even make much As example system told keep extra vacuum cleaner bag behind couch living room
Behind couch living room
Does make sense



It turn vacuum cleaner used usually used carpet living room



When vacuum cleaner bag get full new one needed usually living room
And vacuum cleaner bag
A final insight yet made guide closet organization memory hierarchy
Having cache efficient multiple level smallest fastest largest even better
Where belonging concerned closet one cache level basement another locker third
These decreasing order access speed course use LRU principle basis deciding get evicted level next
But might also able speed thing adding yet another level caching even smaller faster closer one closet
Tom otherwise extremely tolerant wife object pile clothes next bed despite insistence fact highly efficient caching scheme
Fortunately conversation computer scientist revealed solution problem
Rik Belew UC San Diego study search engine cognitive perspective recommended use valet stand
Though see many day valet stand essentially closet compound hanger jacket tie perfect piece hardware domestic caching need
Which go show computer scientist save time might also save marriage
After deciding keep go final challenge knowing organize
We talked go closet closet thing arranged inside
One constant across piece advice seen far idea grouping like like perhaps one directly fly face advice Yukio Noguchi
I emphasize say Noguchi fundamental principle method group file according Noguchi economist University Tokyo author series book offer super trick sorting office life
Their title translate roughly Super Persuasion Method Super Work Method Super Study relevantly u Super Organized Method
Early career economist Noguchi found constantly inundated correspondence data losing significant portion day trying organize
So looked alternative
He began simply putting document file labeled document title date putting file one big box
That saved think right place put result form organization
Then sometime early breakthrough started insert file exclusively side box
And thus super filing system born
The insertion rule Noguchi specifies followed old file well new one every time pull file use content must put back leftmost file return box
And search file always start side well
The recently accessed file thus fastest find
This practice began Noguchi explains returning every file left side easier trying reinsert spot came
Only gradually realize procedure simple also startlingly efficient
The Noguchi Filing System clearly save time replacing something done using
There still question however whether good way find file need first place
After certainly go recommendation efficiency guru tell u put similar thing together
Indeed even etymology word organized evokes body composed nothing cell grouped like like marshalled together similar form function
But computer science give u something efficiency guru guarantee
Though Noguchi know time filing system represents extension LRU principle
LRU tell u add something cache discard oldest tell u put new item
The answer question come line research carried computer scientist
Their version problem called list setup almost exactly mimic Noguchi filing dilemma
Imagine set item sequence must periodically search find specific item
The search constrained must look item one one starting find item looking put back anywhere sequence
Where replace item make searching efficient possible
The definitive paper list published Daniel Sleator Robert Tarjan examined classic computer science fashion performance various way organize list given possible sequence request
Intuitively since search start front want arrange sequence item likely searched appear
But item
We back wishing clairvoyance
If know sequence ahead time say Tarjan customize data structure minimize total time entire sequence
That optimum offline algorithm God algorithm algorithm sky
Of course nobody know future question know future close come optimum algorithm sky Sleator Tarjan result showed simple scheme amazingly come within constant factor clairvoyance
Namely follow LRU simply always put item back front total amount time spend searching never twice long known future
That guarantee algorithm make
Recognizing Noguchi Filing System instance LRU principle action tell u merely efficient
It actually optimal
Sleator Tarjan result also provide u one twist get turning Noguchi Filing System side
Quite simply box file side becomes pile
And nature pile search top bottom time pull document go back found top
You force computer show electronic document pile well
Computers default interface make click folder alphabetical power LRU suggests override display file Last Opened rather What looking almost always near top
In short mathematics list suggests something radical big pile paper desk far fester chaos actually one efficient structure available
What might appear others unorganized mess fact mess
Tossing thing back top pile best shy knowing future
You need organize unsorted pile paper
You already

Software Testing Complete Guide Posted In We tester aware various type Software Testing Functional Testing Testing Automation Testing Testing etc
Each u would come across several type testing testing journey
We might heard might worked everyone knowledge testing type
Each type testing feature advantage disadvantage well
However article I covered mostly every type software testing usually use day day testing life
Let go look
What You Will Learn It common type testing used software industry
The objective testing identify possible issue defect releasing market user
Alpha testing carried end software development phase Beta Testing
Still minor design change may made result testing
conducted developer site
virtual user environment created type testing
An acceptance test performed client verifies whether end end flow system per business requirement per need end user
Client accepts software feature functionality work expected
It last phase testing software go production
This also called User Acceptance Testing UAT
The name suggests testing performed basis
reference test case also without plan documentation place type testing
The objective testing find defect break application executing flow application random functionality
testing informal way finding defect performed anyone project
It difficult identify defect without test case sometimes possible defect found testing might identified using existing test case
The aim determine whether software application accessible disabled people
Here disability mean deaf color blind mentally disabled blind old age disabled group
Various check performed font size visually disabled color contrast color blindness etc
It formal type software testing carried customer
It performed releasing product market actual end user
Beta testing carried ensure major failure software product satisfies business requirement perspective
Beta testing successful customer accepts software
Usually testing typically done others
It final testing done releasing application commercial Beta version software product released limited certain number user specific area
So end user actually us software share feedback company
Company take necessary action releasing software worldwide
Whenever input data entered application store database testing database known
There different database like SQL Server MySQL Oracle etc
Database testing involves testing table structure schema stored procedure data structure
In testing GUI involved tester directly connected database proper access tester easily verify data running query database
There issue identified like data loss deadlock data corruption etc testing issue critical fixing system go live production environment It subtype Compatibility Testing explained performed testing team
Browser Compatibility Testing performed web application ensures software run combination different browser operating system
This type testing also validates whether web application run version browser
It type testing validates whether newly developed software updated software work well older version environment
Backward Compatibility Testing check whether new version software work properly file format created older version software also work well data table data file data structure created older version software
If software updated work well top previous version software
Internal system design considered type testing
Tests based requirement functionality
Detailed information advantage disadvantage type Black box testing seen
This type testing check behavior application boundary level
Testing performed checking defect exist boundary value
Boundary value testing used testing different range number
There upper lower boundary range testing performed boundary value
If testing requires test range number Boundary Value Testing performed value
It type white box testing carried unit testing
Branch Testing name suggests code tested thoroughly traversing every branch
Comparison product strength weakness previous version similar product termed Comparison Testing
It testing type validates software behaves run different environment web server hardware network environment
ensures software run different configuration different database different browser version
Compatibility testing performed testing team
It mostly performed developer completion unit testing
Component Testing involves testing multiple functionality single code objective identify defect exists connecting multiple functionality
Similar system testing involves testing complete application environment situation mimic use interacting database using network communication interacting hardware application system appropriate
It testing technique type Black Box Testing
During equivalence partitioning set group selected value number picked testing
It understood value group generate output
The aim testing remove within specific group generates output defect
Suppose application accepts value using equivalence partitioning value picked testing zero one positive value one negative value
So Equivalence Partitioning testing
It mean testing
Example testing includes scenario also involves scenario based experience tester
Exploratory Testing informal testing performed testing team
The objective testing explore application looking defect exist application
Sometimes may happen testing major defect discovered even cause system failure
During exploratory testing advisable keep track flow tested activity start specific flow
performed without documentation test case
This type testing ignores internal part focus output check per requirement
It type testing geared functional requirement application
For detailed information Functional Testing click
The objective GUI testing validate GUI per business requirement
The expected GUI application mentioned Detailed Design Document GUI mockup screen
The GUI testing includes size button input field present screen alignment text table content table
It also validates menu application selecting different menu menu item validates page fluctuate alignment remains hovering mouse menu
Gorilla Testing testing type performed tester sometimes developer well
In Gorilla Testing one module functionality module tested thoroughly heavily
The objective testing check robustness application
The objective Happy Path Testing test application successfully positive flow
It look negative error condition
The focus valid positive input application generates expected output
This approach testing continuous testing application new functionality added
Application functionality module independent enough test separately
This done programmer tester
Testing done full partial upgrade process different operating system different hardware software environment termed
Testing integrated module verify combined functionality integration termed
Modules typically code module individual application client server application network etc
This type testing especially relevant distributed system
It type testing objective Load testing check much load maximum workload system handle without performance degradation
Load testing help find maximum capacity system specific load issue cause software performance degradation
Load testing performed using tool like LoadRunner WebLoad Silk performer etc
Monkey testing carried tester assuming monkey us application random input value entered Monkey without knowledge understanding application
The objective Monkey Testing check application system get crashed providing random input
Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary aware full functionality system
Mutation Testing type white box testing source code one program changed verifies whether existing test case identify defect system
The change program source code minimal impact entire application specific area impact related test case able identify error system
Testers mindset attitude break using negative testing validate system application break
performed using incorrect data invalid data input
It validates system throw error invalid input behaves expected
It type testing every organization separate team usually called Test NFT team Performance team
NFT testing involves testing requirement Load Testing Stress Testing Security Volume Recovery Testing etc
The objective NFT testing ensure whether response time software application quick enough per business requirement
It take much time load page system sustain peak load
This term often used interchangeably stress load testing
done check whether system meet performance requirement
Different performance load tool used testing
It type testing validates well application system recovers crash disaster
Recovery testing determines system able continue operation disaster
Assume application receiving data network cable suddenly network cable unplugged
Sometime later plug network cable system start receiving data lost connection due network cable unplugged
Testing application whole modification module functionality termed Regression Testing
It difficult cover system typically used type testing
In Risk Based Testing functionality requirement tested based priority
testing includes testing highly critical functionality highest impact business probability failure high
The priority decision based business need priority set functionality high priority functionality test case executed first followed medium low priority functionality
The low priority functionality may tested tested based available time
The testing carried insufficient time available test entire software software need implemented time without delay
This approach followed discussion approval client senior management organization
Sanity Testing done determine new software version performing well enough accept major testing effort
If application crashing initial use system stable enough testing
Hence build application assigned fix
It type testing performed special team tester
A system penetrated hacking way
done check software application website secure internal external threat
This testing includes much software secure malicious program virus secure strong authorization authentication process
It also check software behaves hacker attack malicious program software maintained data security hacker attack
Whenever new build provided development team software testing team validates build ensures major issue exists
The testing team ensures build stable detailed level testing carried
check show stopper defect exists build prevent testing team test application detail
If tester find major critical functionality broken initial stage testing team reject build inform accordingly development team
Smoke Testing carried detailed level functional regression testing
Static Testing type testing executed without code
The execution performed documentation testing phase
It involves review walkthrough inspection deliverable project
Static testing execute code instead code syntax naming convention checked
The also applicable test case test plan design document
It necessary perform static testing testing team defect identified type testing project perspective
This testing done system stressed beyond specification order check fails
This performed heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity complex database query continuous input system database load
Under entire system tested per requirement
It type testing based overall requirement specification cover combined part system
Testing individual software component module termed Unit Testing
It typically done programmer tester requires detailed knowledge internal program design code
It may also require developing test driver module test harness
Under testing check done
Application flow tested know new user understand application easily Proper help documented user get stuck point
Basically system navigation checked testing
The testing involves identifying weakness software hardware network known Vulnerability Testing
Malicious program hacker take control system vulnerable kind attack virus worm
So necessary check system undergo Vulnerability Testing production
It may identify critical defect flaw security
It type testing performed performance testing team
The software application undergoes huge amount data Volume Testing check system behavior response time application system came across high volume data
This high volume data may impact system performance speed processing time
This testing based knowledge internal logic application code
It also known Glass box Testing
Internal software code working known performing type testing
Under test based coverage code statement branch path condition etc
For information white box testing type please click
The testing type part testing
However still list type testing testing type used type project
So I covered common Types Software Testing mostly used testing life cycle
Also alternative definition process used different organization basic concept everywhere
These testing type process implementation method keep changing project requirement scope change
valuable information type testing Thanks Namita Actually I planning detail description type later thought big mess single post
I take one type time future posting
usefull software tester student alpha testing beta testing sequrity usefull thanking u I need sample general checklist detailed checklist need create control chart
It really good
It simple giving good idea
Hello question real time founding bug send developer developer asks clear step better understanding bug sending also unable understand status given developer situation
THIS INFERMATION IS
I NEED FULL INFERMATION ABOUT MERCURY QUALITY U SEND IT

The information provided u really helping
Can u give information java testing
hai This reply answer
Typically know basic knowledge testing mean knowledge enough kind software testing
difference functional testing systemtesting Naga Vishala In case developer might ask bug reporter detail bug make status bug Need Info Thilak The answer NO
Think development If theoretical knowledge programming language say write program using language
No must knowledge
If basic knowledge software testing enough testing type
You gain knowledge type using basic knowledge
chengaiah Functional testing black box testing without considering program structure
You verify program using specification document
System testing end end application testing includes whole application one unit generally tested usability functionality performance load

u share question help
Friends Could please throw light testing us
role Independent Path Unit testing real time
phase SDLC testing
hello friend Can tell specifide result project testing
Folks Lot people asking difference Smoke Sanity testing
And info get confused people becoming
Let make simple Difference Smoke Sanity Smoke testing done verify build tested done properly
The build new updated version software
The motive check application build working fine crash
For example say application following feature say feature page case feature page Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Smoke Test Check page displayed properly broken link page
Check button page clickable disabled hidden
Check traverse back forth page
Check see help section page legal disclaimer section page outgoing link page Check look feel page font user text box displayed properly broken image cluttered text font scramble optional check unless see something unreadable Check able enter info input box need transaction check whether able input text page
Note required transaction Smoke test
In word testing functionality application application build
Sanity Testing done verify whether new updated build functioning properly
Note difference smoke check application build sanity check build functionality higher level
Take example say application following feature Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Sanity Test Check customer critical functionality working performing least one transaction major feature
Your depth sanity testing depends functionality application
Say major feature application
So need perform one transaction feature verify major feature working properly
Sanity test concentrate testing major feature
A feature said major accessed customer frequently daily working important business
Now say login logout enter info delete info generate record main feature application
Sanity test Check able login Check able logout Check able enter info save record new user
Check able delete data existing user
Check generate report current date
You need test rest feature
Nor require run exhaustive test case major feature
Note check basic functioning major feature working
Don run end end multiple operation test case sanity
Just ran Basic test case feature designed
Hope everyone got clear understanding Smoke Sanity testing
And Difference Well

You may asked question interview System testing
What difference Functional System Testing
Functional Testing Everyone know I going explain keep short test functionality software product functional testing
All feature transaction checked functional The common type testing
System Testing Like must read comment End End type testing
mean
You test software right login till
Test everything system testing
M kidding
Then system
It mean check system
Check functionally well Check functionality functional testing
Check requirement like Usability Accessibility Compatibility Localization Performance I recall rest In short supposed test everything kind testing System testing
That called One liner definition system testing To make simple system testing check functional well requirement software
Functional requirement affect product directly like feature whereas requirement affect product like page load time compatibility different browser user friendliness localization
So important check requirement well
Hope everyone clear Lets make Cheers Sameer K meant database testing
done real time
dear friend Computer science working lecturer CS

I confustion cheer jk Hi phalguna Thanks ur reply I need extra info db testing I know like entering data outer interface checking database
I heard need perform I wanted know wtelse thing mentioned happen db hai Plz one tell difference stress load testing example Hi All Here difference see SMOKE TESTING Smoke testing originated hardware testing practice turning new piece hardware first time considering success catch fire smoke
In software industry smoke testing shallow wide approach whereby area application without getting deep tested
A smoke test using written set test automated test A Smoke test designed touch every part application cursory way
It shallow wide
Smoke testing conducted ensure whether crucial function program work bothering finer detail
Such build verification
Smoke testing normal health check build application taking testing depth
SANITY TESTING A sanity test narrow regression test focus one area functionality
Sanity testing usually narrow deep
A sanity test usually unscripted
A Sanity test used determine small section application still working minor change
Sanity testing cursory testing performed whenever cursory testing sufficient prove application functioning according specification
This level testing subset regression testing
sanity testing verify whether requirement met checking feature

mentioned Regression Testing given Below What Regression Testing
Introduction This article attempt take close look process technique Regression Testing
What Regression Testing
If piece Software modified reason testing need done ensure work specified negatively impacted functionality offered previously
This known Regression Testing
Regression Testing attempt verify That application work specified even made The original functionality continues work specified even software application The software application introduced new bug When Regression Testing necessary
Regression Testing play important role Scenario change made previously tested software code
Regression Testing hence important aspect various Software Methodologies software change enhancement occur frequently
Any Software Development Project invariably faced request changing Design code feature
Some Development Methodologies embrace change
For example Extreme Programming Methodology advocate applying small incremental change system based end user feedback
Each change implies Regression Testing need done ensure System meet Project Goals
Why Regression Testing important
Any Software change cause existing functionality break
Changes Software component could impact dependent Components
It commonly observed Software fix could cause bug
All affect quality reliability system
Hence Regression Testing since aim verify important
Making Regression Testing Cost Effective Every time change occurs one following scenario may occur More Functionality may added system More complexity may added system New bug may introduced New vulnerability may introduced system System may tend become fragile change After change new functionality may tested along original functionality
With change Regression Testing could become costly
To make Regression Testing Cost Effective yet ensure good coverage one following technique may applied Test Automation If Test case automated test case may executed using script change introduced system
The execution test case way help eliminate oversight human error
It may also result faster cheaper execution Test case
However cost involved building script
Selective Testing Some Teams choose execute test case selectively
They execute Test Cases Regression Testing
They test decide relevant
This help reduce Testing Time Effort
Regression Testing What Test
Since Regression Testing tends verify software application change made everything may impacted change tested Regression Testing
Generally following area covered Regression Testing Any functionality addressed change Original Functionality system Performance System change introduced Regression Testing How Test
Like Testing Regression Testing Needs proper planning
For Effective Regression Testing done following ingredient necessary Create Regression Test Plan Test Plan identified Focus Areas Strategy Test Entry Exit Criteria
It also outline Testing Prerequisites Responsibilities etc
Create Test Cases Test Cases cover necessary area important
They describe Test Steps needed test Inputs Expected Outputs
Test Cases used Regression Testing specifically cover functionality addressed change component affected change
The Regression Test case may also include testing performance component application change done
Defect Tracking As Testing Levels Types It important Defects tracked systematically otherwise undermines Testing Effort
Thanks Suresh Hi Yamini This Suresh Working Test Engineer
mentioned Test Strategy given Below Test strategy hope brief version test case Test strategy company level document say approch test strategy doc also say scope business issue test delivarables tool used risk analysis etc

Which type testing suit PVT
PVT Production Verification Test Hi Diff b w sanity testing
Diff B w Priority severity
correct flow testing real
Sanity testing make sure product work general
Regression test make sure issue happened
Normally regresssion test done bug fixed
Then sanity test done make sure bug fix make side effecct overall function
Severity level defined symptom
high severity system crash function available low severity comic error
While priority base business consideration

STB click speed forward button effective twice high priority issue
But MOD ordering click Ok button effective twice high priority issue need fixed
one describe difference Functional Non functional testing example

investigation conducted provide stakeholder information product service test
Software testing also provide objective independent view software allow business appreciate understand risk software implementation
Test technique include process executing program application intent finding error defect verifying software product fit use
Software testing involves execution software component system component evaluate one property interest
In general property indicate extent component system test As number possible test even simple software component practically infinite software testing us strategy select test feasible available time resource
As result software testing typically exclusively attempt execute program application intent finding error defect
The job testing iterative process one bug fixed illuminate deeper bug even create new one
Software testing provide objective independent information quality software risk failure user sponsor
Software testing conducted soon executable software even partially complete exists
The often determines testing conducted
For example phased process testing occurs system requirement defined implemented testable program
In contrast requirement programming testing often done concurrently
Although testing determine correctness software assumption specific hypothesis see testing identify defect within software
Instead furnishes compare state behavior product mechanism someone might recognize problem
These oracle may include limited specification comparable product past version product inference intended expected purpose user customer expectation relevant standard applicable law criterion
A primary purpose testing detect software failure defect may discovered corrected
Testing establish product function properly condition function properly specific condition
The scope software testing often includes examination code well execution code various environment condition well examining aspect code supposed need
In current culture software development testing organization may separate development team
There various role testing team member
Information derived software testing may used correct process software developed
Every software product target audience
For example audience video game software completely different banking software
Therefore organization develops otherwise invests software product ass whether software product acceptable end user target audience purchaser stakeholder
Software testing aid process attempting make assessment
Not software defect caused coding error
One common source expensive defect requirement gap unrecognized requirement result error omission program designer
Requirement gap often
Software fault occur following process
A programmer make mistake result fault bug software
If defect executed certain situation system produce wrong result causing
Not defect necessarily result failure
For example defect never result failure
A defect turn failure environment changed
Examples change environment include software run new platform alteration interacting different software
A single defect may result wide range failure symptom
A fundamental problem software testing testing combination input precondition initial state feasible even simple product
This mean number software product large defect occur infrequently difficult find testing
More significantly dimension quality supposed versus supposed highly subjective something constitutes sufficient value one person may intolerable another
Software developer ca test everything use combinatorial test design identify minimum number test needed get coverage want
Combinatorial test design enables user get greater test coverage fewer test
Whether looking speed test depth use combinatorial test design method build structured variation test case
A study conducted report software bug cost economy billion annually
More third cost could avoided better software testing performed
software testing cost common China Philippines India preferred destination
Software testing done dedicated software tester
Until term software tester used generally later also seen separate profession
Regarding period different goal software testing different role established
Software testing also performed software tester
The separation testing initially introduced
Although attention breakage testing A successful test case one detects undiscovered error
illustrated desire software engineering community separate fundamental development activity debugging verification
There many approach available software testing
referred static testing whereas actually executing programmed code given set referred
Static testing often implicit proofreading plus programming editor check source code structure compiler check syntax data flow
Dynamic testing take place program run
Dynamic testing may begin program complete order test particular section code applied discrete module
Typical technique either using execution environment
Static testing involves whereas dynamic testing also involves
Together help improve
Among technique static analysis used ensure test case detect error introduced mutating source code
Software testing method traditionally divided testing
These two approach used describe point view test engineer take designing test case
testing also known clear box testing glass box testing transparent box testing structural testing seeing source code test internal structure working program opposed functionality exposed
In testing internal perspective system well programming skill used design test case
The tester chooses input exercise path code determine appropriate output
This analogous testing node circuit
ICT
While testing applied level software testing process usually done unit level
It test path within unit path unit integration subsystem test
Though method test design uncover many error problem might detect unimplemented part specification missing requirement
Techniques used testing include Code coverage tool evaluate completeness test suite created method including testing
This allows software team examine part system rarely tested ensures important tested
Code coverage reported percentage statement coverage ensures code path branch term executed least
This helpful ensuring correct functionality sufficient since code may process different input correctly incorrectly
testing treat software black box examining functionality without knowledge internal implementation without seeing source code
The tester aware software supposed
testing method include testing testing testing
testing aim test functionality software according applicable requirement
This level testing usually requires thorough provided tester simply verify given input output value behavior either expected value specified test case
Test case built around specification requirement application supposed
It us external description software including specification requirement design derive test case
These test though usually functional
testing may necessary assure correct functionality insufficient guard complex situation
One advantage black box technique programming knowledge required
Whatever bias programmer may tester likely different set may emphasize different area functionality
On hand testing said like walk dark labyrinth without flashlight
Because examine source code situation tester writes many test case check something could tested one test case leaf part program untested
This method test applied level software testing
It typically comprises testing higher level also dominate unit testing well
The aim visual testing provide developer ability examine happening point software failure presenting data way developer easily find information requires information expressed clearly
At core visual testing idea showing someone problem test failure rather describing greatly increase clarity understanding
Visual testing therefore requires recording entire test process capturing everything occurs test system video format
Output video supplemented tester input via webcam audio commentary microphone
Visual testing provides number advantage
The quality communication increased drastically tester show problem event leading developer opposed describing need replicate test failure cease exist many case
The developer evidence requires test failure instead focus cause fault fixed
Visual testing particularly environment deploy development software since agile method require greater communication tester developer collaboration within small team
important methodology checking software integrity require le preparation time implement important bug found quickly
In testing testing take place improvised impromptu way ability test tool visually record everything occurs system becomes important order document step taken uncover bug
Visual testing gathering recognition test used many individual involved development process
For customer becomes easy provide detailed bug report feedback program user visual testing record user action screen well voice image provide complete picture time software failure developer
testing American spelling testing involves knowledge internal data structure algorithm purpose designing test executing test user level
The tester required full access software source code
Manipulating input data formatting output qualify input output clearly outside black box calling system test
This distinction particularly important conducting two module code written two different developer interface exposed test
However test require modifying data repository database log file qualify user would normally able change data repository normal production operation
testing may also include determine instance boundary value error message
By knowing underlying concept software work tester make testing choice testing software outside
Typically tester permitted set isolated testing environment activity seeding
The tester observe state product tested performing certain action executing statement database executing query ensure expected change reflected
testing implement intelligent test scenario based limited information
This particularly apply data type handling
There generally four recognized level test unit testing integration testing component interface testing system testing
Tests frequently grouped added software development process level specificity test
The main level development process defined guide system testing distinguished test target without implying specific process model
Other test level classified testing objective
There two different level test perspective customer testing LLT testing HLT
LLT group test different level component software application product
HLT group test whole software application product
Unit testing refers test verify functionality specific section code usually function level
In environment usually class level minimal unit test include constructor destructors
These type test usually written developer work code style ensure specific function working expected
One function might multiple test catch branch code
Unit testing alone verify functionality piece software rather used ensure building block software work independently
Unit testing software development process involves synchronized application broad spectrum defect prevention detection strategy order reduce software development risk time cost
It performed software developer engineer construction phase software development lifecycle
Unit testing aim eliminate construction error code promoted additional testing strategy intended increase quality resulting software well efficiency overall development process
Depending organization expectation software development unit testing might include metric analysis peer code review analysis software testing practice
Integration testing type software testing seek verify interface component software design
Software component may integrated iterative way together big bang
Normally former considered better practice since allows interface issue located quickly fixed
Integration testing work expose defect interface interaction integrated component module
Progressively larger group tested software component corresponding element architectural design integrated tested software work system
The practice component interface testing used check handling data passed various unit subsystem component beyond full integration testing unit
The data passed considered message packet range data type checked data generated one unit tested validity passed another unit
One option interface testing keep separate log file data item passed often timestamp logged allow analysis thousand case data passed unit day week
Tests include checking handling extreme data value interface variable passed normal value
Unusual data value interface help explain unexpected performance next unit
Component interface testing variation focus data value beyond related action subsystem component
System testing test completely integrated system verify system meet requirement
For example system test might involve testing logon interface creating editing entry plus sending printing result followed summary processing deletion archiving entry logoff
Operational acceptance used conduct operational readiness product service system part
OAT common type software testing used mainly project
This type testing focus system supported become part production environment
Hence also known operational readiness testing ORT OR A testing
within OAT limited test required verify aspect system
In addition software testing ensure portability system well working expected also damage partially corrupt operating environment cause process within environment become inoperative
Different label way grouping testing may testing type technique
Most software system installation procedure needed used main purpose
Testing procedure achieve installed software system may used known installation testing
A common cause software failure real perceived lack operating system old new target environment differ greatly original application intended run required become must render
For example case lack occur programmer develop test software latest version target environment user may running
This result unintended consequence latest work may function earlier version target environment older hardware earlier version target environment capable using
Sometimes issue fixed proactively operating system functionality separate program
determines whether reasonable proceed testing
consists minimal attempt operate software designed determine whether basic problem prevent working
Such test used
Regression testing focus finding defect major code change occurred
Specifically seek uncover degraded lost feature including old bug come back
Such regression occur whenever software functionality previously working correctly stop working intended
Typically regression occur program change newly developed part software collides previously existing code
Common method regression testing include previous set test case checking whether previously fixed fault
The depth testing depends phase release process added feature
They either complete change added late release deemed risky shallow consisting positive test feature change early release deemed low risk
Regression testing typically largest test effort commercial software development due checking numerous detail prior software feature even new software developed using old test case test part new design ensure prior functionality still supported
Acceptance testing mean one two thing Alpha testing simulated actual operational testing potential independent test team developer site
Alpha testing often employed software form internal acceptance testing software go beta testing
Beta testing come alpha testing considered form external
Versions software known released limited audience outside programming team known beta tester
The software released group people testing ensure product fault
Beta version made available open public increase field maximal number future user deliver value earlier extended even indefinite period time
refers activity verify specific action function code
These usually found code requirement documentation although development methodology work use case user story
Functional test tend answer question user particular feature work
refers aspect software may related specific function user action behavior certain
Testing determine breaking point point extreme scalability performance lead unstable execution
requirement tend reflect quality product particularly context suitability perspective user
Continuous testing process executing part software delivery pipeline obtain immediate feedback business risk associated software release candidate
Continuous testing includes validation scope testing extends validating requirement user story assessing system requirement associated overarching business goal
Destructive testing attempt cause software fail
It verifies software function properly even receives invalid unexpected input thereby establishing input validation routine
form example failure testing
Various commercial testing tool linked page also numerous free software tool available perform destructive testing
Performance testing generally executed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
primarily concerned testing system continue operate specific load whether large quantity data large number
This generally referred software
The related load testing activity performed activity often referred
way test software function even certain component example file database increase radically size
way test reliability unexpected rare workload
often referred load endurance testing check see software continuously function well acceptable period
There little agreement specific goal performance testing
The term load testing performance testing volume testing often used interchangeably
system strict timing constraint
To test timing constraint met used
check user interface easy use understand
It concerned mainly use application
testing may include compliance standard essential software process confidential data prevent
The International Organization Standardization ISO defines type testing conducted evaluate degree test item associated data information protected unauthorised person system use read modify authorized person system denied access
The general ability software automatically tested without actual translation using
It verify application still work even translated new language adapted new culture different currency time zone
Actual translation human language must tested
Possible localization failure include Development Testing software development process involves synchronized application broad spectrum defect prevention detection strategy order reduce software development risk time cost
It performed software developer engineer construction phase software development lifecycle
Development Testing aim eliminate construction error code promoted testing strategy intended increase quality resulting software well efficiency overall development process
Depending organization expectation software development Development Testing might include data flow analysis metric analysis peer code review unit testing code coverage analysis traceability software testing practice
testing basically comparison two output generally one variable changed run test change one thing run test compare result
This useful situation useful program
With complex project multivariant testing done
In concurrent testing focus performance continuously running normal input normal operational condition opposed stress testing fuzz testing
Memory leak well basic fault easier find method
In software testing conformance testing verifies product performs according specified standard
Compilers instance extensively tested determine whether meet recognized standard language
A common practice software testing testing performed independent group tester functionality developed shipped customer
This practice often result testing phase used buffer compensate project delay thereby compromising time devoted testing
Another practice start software testing moment project start continuous process project finish
In contrast emerging software discipline movement adhere model
In process written first often extreme programming methodology
The test expected fail initially
As code written test pas incrementally larger portion test suite
The test suite continuously updated new failure condition corner case discovered integrated regression test developed
Unit test maintained along rest software source code generally integrated build process inherently interactive test relegated partially manual build acceptance process
The ultimate goal test process achieve software update published public frequently
This methodology increase testing effort done development reaching formal testing team
In development model test execution occurs requirement defined coding process completed
Although variation exist organization typical cycle testing
The sample common among organization employing model
The practice commonly found development model might clear explicit
Many programming group relying especially group use
There many framework write test software run test automatically every time code checked system
While automation reproduce everything human way think useful regression testing
However require testing script order truly useful
Program testing fault detection aided significantly testing tool
tool include feature Some feature may incorporated single composite tool IDE
Quality measure include topic completeness requirement capability compatibility
There number frequently used measure used assist determining state software adequacy testing
Based amount test case required construct complete test suite context
test suite applied implementation test collect enough information precisely determine whether system correct incorrect according specification hierarchy testing difficulty proposed
It includes following class It proved class strictly included next
For instance testing assume behavior implementation test denoted deterministic known finite set input output known number state belongs Class I subsequent class
However number state known belongs class Class II
If implementation test must deterministic machine failing specification single trace continuation number state unknown belongs class Class III
Testing temporal machine transition triggered input produced within interval belongs class Class IV whereas testing many system belongs Class V even belong Class I
The inclusion Class I require simplicity assumed computation model testing case involving implementation written programming language testing implementation defined machine depending continuous magnitude proved Class I
Other elaborated case testing framework must semantics temporal machine rational timeouts belong Class II
A software testing process produce several
The actual artifact produced factor SW Development Model used stakeholder organisational need
Several certification program exist support professional aspiration software tester quality assurance specialist
No certification offered actually requires applicant show ability test software
No certification based widely accepted body knowledge
This led declare testing field ready certification
Certification measure individual productivity skill practical knowledge guarantee competence professionalism tester
Some major include It commonly believed earlier defect found cheaper fix
The following table show cost fixing defect depending stage found
For example problem requirement found would cost time fix already found requirement review
With advent modern practice service cost maintenance may lessen time
The data table extrapolated scant
Laurent Bossavit say analysis The smaller project curve turn two team student sample size small extrapolating smaller project general totally indefensible
The GTE study explain data say came two project one large one small
The paper cited Bell Labs Safeguard project specifically disclaims collected data Boehm data point suggest
The IBM study Fagan paper contains claim seem contradict Boehm graph numerical result clearly correspond data point
Boehm even cite paper TRW data except writing Making Software cited original article
There exists large study conducted TRW right time Boehm cite paper contain sort data would support Boehm claim
Software testing used association The term verification validation commonly used interchangeably industry also common see two term defined contradictory definition
According IEEE Standard Glossary Software Engineering Terminology And according ISO standard The contradiction caused use concept requirement specified requirement different meaning
In case IEEE standard specified requirement mentioned definition validation set problem need want stakeholder software must solve satisfy
Such requirement documented Software Requirements Specification SRS
And product mentioned definition verification output artifact every phase software development process
These product fact specification Architectural Design Specification Detailed Design Specification etc
The SRS also specification verified least sense used subject
But ISO specified requirement set specification mentioned must verified
A specification previously explained product software development process phase receives another specification input
A specification verified successfully correctly implement input specification
All specification verified except SRS first one validated though
Examples The Design Specification must implement SRS Construction phase artifact must implement Design Specification
So word defined common term apparent contradiction disappears
Both SRS software must validated
The SRS validated statically consulting stakeholder
Nevertheless running partial implementation software prototype kind dynamic testing obtaining positive feedback increase certainty SRS correctly formulated
On hand software final running product artifact document including source code must validated dynamically stakeholder executing software try
Some might argue SRS input word stakeholder therefore SRS validation SRS verification
Thinking way advisable cause confusion
It better think verification process involving formal technical input document
Software testing may considered part SQA process
In SQA software process specialist auditor concerned software development process rather artefact documentation code system
They examine change software engineering process reduce number fault end delivered software defect rate
What constitutes acceptable defect rate depends nature software A flight simulator video game would much higher defect tolerance software actual airplane
Although close link SQA testing department often exist independently may SQA function company
Software testing activity investigate software test order provide information stakeholder
By contrast QA implementation policy procedure intended prevent defect reaching customer

Projects funded agency pursued research laboratory yielded extensive pool talented personnel field computer graphic simulation networked established link academic military commercial work
The history technological development social took place subject article
Artists performer entertainer always interested technique creating imaginative world setting narrative fictional space deceiving sens
Numerous precedent suspension disbelief artificial world artistic entertainment medium preceded
Illusionary space created painting view constructed residence public space since antiquity culminating monumental century
Panoramas blurred visual boundary image displaying main scene space viewed creating illusion event depicted
This image tradition stimulated creation series futuristic theatre design stereopticons movie IMAX movie course century achieve similar effect
For example widescreen film format originally called Vitarama invented Fair Ralph Walker originated Waller study vision depth perception
Waller work led focus importance vision immersion artificial environment goal devise projection technology could duplicate entire human field vision
The Vitarama process used multiple camera projector screen create illusion immersion space perceived viewer
Though Vitarama commercial hit Cinerama Army Air Corps successfully used system World War II training name Waller Flexible Gunnery example link entertainment technology would later advance development virtual reality
Sensory stimulation promising method creating virtual environment use computer
After release promotional film called cinematographer Morton Heilig became fascinated Cinerama movie
Like Waller studied human sensory signal hoping realize cinema By late Heilig built individual console variety image motion chair audio temperature change odour blown patented Sensorama Simulator designed stimulate sens individual simulate actual experience During work Sensorama also designed Telesphere Mask stereoscopic TV display patented
Although Heilig unsuccessful effort market Sensorama extended idea multiviewer theatre concept patented Experience Theater similar system called Thrillerama
The seed virtual reality planted several computing field especially interactive computer graphic simulation
Beginning late funded Navy successor project SAGE radar system funded Air Force first utilized CRT display input device light pen originally called light gun
By time SAGE system became operational operator routinely using device display aircraft position manipulate related data
During popular cultural image computer calculating automated electronic brain capable manipulating data previously unimaginable speed
The advent affordable computer emancipated machine narrow view shifted attention way computing could augment human potential rather simply substituting specialized domain number crunching
In professor MIT specializing psychoacoustics posited symbiosis applied psychological principle interaction interface
He argued partnership computer human brain would surpass capability either alone
As founding director new IPTO DARPA Licklider able fund encourage project aligned vision interaction also serving priority military system data visualization system
Another pioneer electrical engineer computer scientist began work computer graphic MIT Lincoln Laboratory Whirlwind SAGE developed
In Sutherland completed system drawing interactively CRT display light pen control board
Sutherland paid careful attention structure data representation made system useful interactive manipulation image
In put charge IPTO led computer graphic program one DARPA premier research centre
In Sutherland outlined characteristic called ultimate display speculated computer imagery could construct plausible richly virtual world
His notion world began visual representation sensory input end also called multiple mode sensory input
DARPA sponsored work output input device aligned vision Sketchpad III system Timothy Johnson presented view object Larry Roberts Lincoln Wand system drawing three dimension invention new input device computer
Within year Sutherland contributed technological often identified virtual reality computer display
In part carried test helicopter pilot wore HMD showed video infrared camera mounted beneath helicopter
The camera moved pilot head augmenting night vision providing level immersion sufficient pilot equate field vision image camera
This kind system would later called human capacity vision real world
When Sutherland left DARPA began work tethered display computer image
This apparatus shaped fit head goggles displayed graphical output
Because display heavy borne comfortably held place suspension system
Two small CRT display mounted device near wearer ear mirror reflected image eye creating stereo visual environment could viewed comfortably short distance
The HMD also tracked wearer looking correct image would generated field vision
The viewer immersion displayed virtual space intensified visual isolation HMD yet sens isolated degree wearer could continue walk around
An important area application VR system always training activity
The appeal simulation provide training equal nearly equal practice real system reduced cost greater safety
This particularly case military training first significant application commercial simulator pilot training World War II
rely visual motion feedback augment sensation flying seated closed ground
The Link Company founded former piano maker Edwin Link began construct first late eventually settling blue box design acquired Army Air Corps
The first system used motion feedback increase familiarity flight control
Pilots trained sitting simulated cockpit could moved hydraulically response action photograph
Later version added cyclorama scene painted wall outside simulator provide limited visual feedback
Not Celestial Navigation Trainer commissioned British government World War II projected film strip used Link system could project filmed along correct flight landing path generate new imagery based trainee action
By flight trainer using film television visual experience flying
The image could distorted generate flight path diverted slightly filmed sometimes multiple camera used provide different perspective movable camera mounted scale model depict airport simulated landing
Inspired control Link flight trainer Sutherland suggested display include multiple sensory output joystick muscle sensor eye tracker user would fully immersed displayed environment fly concept never visual In moved University Utah colleague founded Evans Sutherland Computer Corporation
The new company initially focused development graphic application scene generator system
These system could render scene roughly frame per second early minimum frame rate effective flight training
constructed first flight simulator computer image generation first Navy
By system capable generating simple model hundred polygon face utilized collection dot could model solid object texture enhance sense
By late military flight simulator also incorporating display VITAL helmet primarily required much le space projected display
A sophisticated head tracker HMD followed pilot eye movement match CGI view handling flight control
Advances flight simulator interface system pointed possibility immersive control system research training also improved performance
Since electrical engineer Thomas Furness working visual display instrumentation cockpit Air Force
By late begun development virtual interface flight control demonstrated Visually Coupled Airborne Systems known helmet armoured archvillain popular movie
From Furness directed air force Super Cockpit program
The essential idea project capacity human pilot handle spatial information depended data portrayed way take advantage human natural perceptual Applying HMD goal Furness designed system projected information map infrared radar imagery avionics data immersive virtual space pilot could view hear real time
The helmet tracking system control sensor enabled pilot control aircraft gesture utterance eye movement translating immersion virtual space control
The natural perceptual interface also reduced complexity number control cockpit
The Super Cockpit thus realized Licklider vision creating virtual environment pilot flew data
Beginning British Aerospace part also used HMD basis similar training simulator known Virtual Cockpit incorporated head hand eye tracking well
Sutherland Furness brought notion simulator technology imagery virtual world represented abstract model data
In system visual verisimilitude le important immersion feedback engaged sens meaningful way
This approach important medical scientific research
Project GROPE started particularly noteworthy advancement made possible study
Brooks sought enhance perception comprehension interaction drug molecule receptor site protein creating window virtual world molecular docking force
He combined imagery represent molecule physical force haptic tactile feedback mediated special device arrange virtual molecule minimum binding energy configuration
Scientists using system felt way around represented force like flight trainee learning instrument Link cockpit grasping physical situation depicted virtual world hypothesizing new drug based manipulation
During Brooks laboratory extended use virtual reality radiology ultrasound imaging
Virtual reality extended technology telepresence use robotic device controlled remotely mediated sensory feedback perform task
The foundation virtual surgery expansion microsurgery le invasive form surgery
By late microcameras attached endoscopic device relayed image could shared among group surgeon looking one monitor often location
In early DARPA funded research develop telepresence workstation surgical procedure
This Sutherland window virtual world added dimension level sensory feedback could match surgeon fine motor control coordination
The first telesurgery equipment developed SRI International first robotic surgery performed Broussais Hospital Paris
As virtual world became detailed immersive people began spend time space entertainment inspiration socializing
Research conceived virtual place fantasy space focusing activity subject rather replication real environment particularly conducive entertainment
Beginning Myron Krueger created series project nature human creativity virtual environment later called artificial reality
Much Krueger work especially VIDEOPLACE system processed interaction participant digitized image graphical object
VIDEOPLACE could analyze process user action real world translate interaction system virtual object various preprogrammed way
Different mode interaction name like finger painting digital drawing suggest aesthetic dimension system
VIDEOPLACE differed several aspect training research simulation
In particular system reversed emphasis user perceiving computer generated world computer perceiving user action converting action object space within virtual world
With emphasis shifted responsiveness interaction Krueger found representation became le important interaction participant rapidity response image form sensory input
The ability manipulate virtual object see central presentation compelling virtual significance data glove emergence VR commerce popular
Data glove relay user hand finger movement VR system translates wearer gesture manipulation virtual object
The first data glove developed project funded called Sayre Glove one team member
In Thomas Zimmerman invented first optical glove Gary Grimes constructed Digital Data Entry Glove first glove sufficient flexibility inertial sensor monitor hand position variety application providing keyboard input data entry
Zimmerman glove would greatest impact
He thinking year constructing interface device musician based common practice playing air guitar particular glove capable tracking hand finger movement could used control instrument electronic synthesizer
He patented optical device used fibre one year Grimes patented computer interface device
By Zimmerman working Atari Research Center Sunnyvale California along Scott Fisher Brenda Laurel VR researcher would active beyond
Jaron Lanier another researcher Atari shared Zimmerman interest
Beginning worked together improving design data glove left Atari start VPL Research first commercial product VPL DataGlove
By Fisher also left Atari join NASA Ames Research Center Moffett Field California founding director Virtual Environment Workstation VIEW project
The VIEW project put together package objective summarized previous work artificial environment ranging creation multisensory immersive virtual environment workstation telepresence teleoperation application

While objective NASA develop telerobotics automated space station future planetary exploration group also considered use entertainment scientific educational purpose
The VIEW workstation called Virtual Visual Environment Display completed established standard suite VR technology included stereoscopic display head tracker speech recognition imagery data glove audio technology
The brought market October year appeared cover
VPL also spawned system called DataSuit display called EyePhone shared VR system two people called Reality Built Two
VPL declared June Virtual Reality On day VPL Autodesk publicly demonstrated first commercial VR system
The Autodesk VR CAD system based VPL technology scaled operation
The marketing splash introduced Lanier new term realization cyberspace concept introduced writer
Lanier dreadlocked chief executive officer VPL became public celebrity new VR industry announcement Autodesk VPL let loose torrent enthusiasm speculation marketing hype
Soon seemed VR everywhere PowerGlove HMD movie Nintendo VirtualBoy game system television series
Numerous VR company founded early energy unleashed VPL Autodesk marketing campaign dissipated
The VR configuration took shape span project leading Sutherland data glove multimodal sensory input broad appeal quickly enthusiast predicted
Instead visible successfully marketed product entertainment system rather personal VR system
These VR arcade simulator designed team game movie simulation theme park industry combined attribute video game amusement park ride highly immersive storytelling
Perhaps important early project Disneyland Star Tours immersive flight simulator ride based movie series designed collaboration producer Industrial Light Magic
long built themed ride utilizing advanced technology animatronic Pirates Caribbean attraction originally installed Disneyland
Star Tours utilized simulated motion technology mixing technique learned Hollywood film military flight simulator strong story line architectural element shaped viewer experience moment entered waiting line attraction
After opening Star Tours Walt Disney Imagineering embarked series project apply interactive technology immersive environment ride system including used DisneyQuest indoor interactive theme park virtual world
In Virtual World Entertainment opened first emporium Chicago

A also known usually refers group individual work together different geographic location rely email FAX video voice conferencing service order collaborate
The term also refer group team work together asynchronously across organizational level
Powell Piccoli Ives define virtual team group geographically organizationally time dispersed worker brought together information telecommunication technology accomplish one organizational task
According Ale Ebrahim et
al
virtual team also defined small temporary group geographically organizationally time dispersed coordinate work predominantly electronic information communication technology order accomplish one organization task
Members virtual team may never meet
Virtual team made possible proliferation significantly increased scope
Virtual team allow company procure best talent without geographical restriction
According Hambley Kline virtual team require new way working across boundary system process technology people requires effective leadership despite widespread increase virtual teamwork relatively little focus role virtual team leader
There three main aspect virtual team purpose people link
While purpose important aspect critical aspect virtual team purpose hold virtual team together
Virtual team common structure may organization purpose brings hold team together
Purpose generally translated certain action step people work defined structure consisting common goal individual task result
A number factor may affect performance member virtual team
For example team member higher degree focused attention aggregate lower level temporal dissociation may higher performance
Further member higher degree attention focus may prefer asynchronous communication channel low level flow may prefer synchronous communication channel
Powell Piccoli Ives found investigated article virtual team concluded current research found four main focus area
virtual team mean simply forming VT planned
This mean structuring interaction kind communication tool used much time possible etc
Research found team building exercise establishment shared norm Sarker et establishment clear team structure help team succeed
Kirkman et al
found empirically meeting improved empowerment virtual team lead better learning
Numerous communication problem diverted creating shared knowledge database order allow team member information know others
As added bonus shared knowledge database also share language mental model substitute important time
Furthermore shared mental model focused designing requiring team create goal strategy
This shown clearly improve team With also coordination problem obstacle effective communication involved
These problem may solved actively understanding accepting difference culture
The team seems positive effect team performance satisfaction belonging team
At time high trust found develop
On hand relationship technology task performance found dependent experience technology group membership type task group working
Diverse technological skill create conflict among team
This team consistent improve team performance
For instance mentoring good way make personal tie experienced virtual team professional
According Tan et consistent training foster cohesiveness trust teamwork commitment team goal individual satisfaction higher perceived decision quality
In article taught communication technique called dialogue technique
It created three stage small talk sharing mental model norm building
The overall result found virtual team exhibit higher task conflict lower communication frequency knowledge sharing performance satisfaction
Although finding consistent previous research result suggest result generalize type team methodological approach
Virtualness different effect team depending
For team leaner medium misattributions subgroup potentially contribute le effective team
In team member make fewer misattributions person interact longer time frame develop relationship
Also longer time span teammate build group identity help overcome difference
There negative effect team performance satisfaction team conflict actually decreased degree virtualness increased
Although negative effect communication frequency knowledge sharing effect much le team compared team
Virtualness also varying influence team depending virtualness measured well length time team working together
The negative effect effect team disappeared longer term team
Their result also showed different effect virtualness depending type analysis used individual group method experiment survey virtual work
This section introduces emotional problem involved mitigation tactic needed achieve cohesion trust among team member
Overall research report positive link process outcome virtual team project
Because geographical distribution time occurs rarely
This according research result weaker social link lead team socially focused
If meeting feasible meeting held much possible beginning team formation order bring closer form interpersonal bond
These meeting focus actual business
However socializing different cultural preference remembered
If meeting possible feasible desired extent approach applied
done partially via electronic communication tool
Jarvenpaa Leidner study found team communicate socially achieve higher trust better social emotional relationship
Leaders help foster relationship building general team building many way
providing continuous feedback listening team opinion suggestion clearly stating team member role consistency leadership style
mean sense unity team
Cohesion important virtual team associated better performance greater satisfaction
Cohesion trust important fostering team effectiveness
It found take away development cohesion within Virtual Teams traditional team higher level team cohesiveness
Another study found although virtual team may start low cohesion time exchange enough social information develop strong cohesion
In comparing men woman perception cohesion virtual team Lind found woman virtual team men traditional team perceived greater team cohesiveness men virtual team
However virtual team difficulty attaining cohesion
Research development virtual team centered relationship building specifically team cohesion trust
Relationship building deal interaction increase inclusiveness
process outcome virtual team project closely related virtual team need meet need virtual team member order successful
particularly problematic subject virtual team arguable whether people expected trust never met
Furthermore trust noted crucial successful team usually much time build little little often team project
Jarvenpaa Leidner describe mechanism people solve trust problem short time
It called suggests team member assume beginning team member trustworthy
They adjust assumption lifetime team
Jarvenpaa Leidner also researched difference team high level trust beginning team high amount trust end compared
To achieve high trust early group life team social enthusiastic communication coped well technical uncertainty took individual initiative
The group enjoyed trust later predictable communication timely response positive leadership ability move social communication communication
The integrity team member important development trust perception member benevolence support maintenance trust time
meeting beginning stage team become virtual help develops strong trust
Task process action team member carry order accomplish goal complete project
The three main part task process communication coordination fit
one crucial thing virtual team
Communication vital success virtual team crucial team group excellent communicator proper technology best level communication
It start selecting excellent communicator team member right technology use
Virtual communication technology cause many difficulty effective team communication time delay common reference frame difference interpretation assurance participation remote team member
Some empirically found challenge successful communication virtual team failure communicate due wrong lacking contextual information unevenly distributed information interpretation meaning silence technical problem
Nonverbal communication vital team communication also missing virtual team
Traditional team communicate effectively virtual team
Difficulties often arise team member others geographically distant
There assumption team member communicate information communicated distant member cause friction member
Leadership cultural difference also substantially affect effectiveness communication
The frequency predictability communication much feedback provided regularly improves effectiveness communication lead greater team trust improves team performance
On hand inconsistent infrequent communication reduces coordination success virtual team
One common reason team member leave short amount time without communicating absence member
However virtual team found communicate frequently normal team virtual team higher communication combined gender virtual team
Higher effective communication shown improve cultural understanding
Inequalities hierarchy within group reduced via email communication also make easier access higher level employee due difficulty scheduling face face meeting
However minority member likely express opinion anonymous condition though opinion accepted condition
CMC group create hierarchy try preserve status quota
bias found student group Cramton
Lateral communication virtual team important team ability adapt change especially moving Virtual Teams
Lateral communication improved creating flatter reporting structure hierarchy well using computer mediated communication tool
The extensive reliance communication technology lead reduced effect difficulty management compared traditional team
Researchers found solution problem
One company created reward system team cooperation encourage people actively accurately communicate
On hand according Pink research rewarding creativity rewarding communication sustainable way encourage cooperation
In another company emphasized need debate well merely share information
Predictability feedback also frequently improve communication effectiveness creating trust better team performance
In addition one study researcher tested question whether adding video electronic communication help explain detailed task map route another person
They found native speaker pair bring additional benefit speaker pair brought significant improvement task
much combined effort exists various part organization consistent coherent
Coordination positively associated virtual team performance
However difficult virtual team coordinate across time zone cultural divide divergent mental model
The development type collaboration norm within team necessary team meld team member contribution
meeting especially helping leading successful project
If meeting possible formal protocol communication training improves coordination collaboration activity
Minimizing cultural barrier also improves coordination team member
It naturally difficult coordinate virtual team different time zone culture mental model
Collaboration norm develop team function well
As mentioned periodical meeting good way form relationship also good vehicle coordinate activity drive project forward
When meeting feasible one alternative develop coordination protocol communication training
Ramesh Dennis suggested standardizing input process output
This help team coordinate help party
The fit examines possible fit various technology available Studies hypothesized technology fit depends individual preference
experience use urgency task The technology used dependent personal preference previous experience technology ease use need documenting project activity urgent task
found meeting phone call suitable ambiguous task managing conflict managing external resource brainstorming strategic talk
Electronic communication suitable structured task routine analysis examining design tradeoff monitoring project status
Interestingly study team first adjusted organization technology hand later also adjusted technology organization
Output virtual team mean thing come work process team
Decision quality one output virtual team
The majority research found significant evidence difference decision quality virtual traditional team number idea generated
However Chidambaram Bostrom found virtual team generate idea compared traditional team
As many constraint working virtually virtual team require longer time reach decision When comparing performance traditional virtual team result mixed
Some study find traditional team virtual team better
The majority study found team level
Powell Piccoli Ives list many study found different factor make virtual team successful
The found factor The result different student study mixed concerning working virtual team
Tan et al
found team used dialogue technique decision made team
One study found traditional team started satisfied virtual team
Then le year satisfaction virtual team rose exceeded satisfaction traditional team
Women satisfied men virtual team also satisfied compared woman traditional team
Team member satisfied likely training used communication method compared unsatisfied team member
Below common type virtual team
Generally networked team geographically distributed necessarily organization
These team frequently created frequently dissolved usually formed discus specific topic member area expertise possibly different organization pitch idea discussion
Depending complexity issue additional member team may added time
The duration team last may vary significantly depending fast slow issue resolved
Parallel team highly task oriented team usually consist specialized professional
While generally required short span time unlike networked team dissolved completion task
The team may either internal external organization
Similar parallel team team geographically distributed may operate different timezones
Project development team mainly focused creating new product information system organizational process user customer
These team exist longer parallel team added ability make decision rather make recommendation
Similar networked team project development team may also add remove member team given time needed area expertise
These team totally function specific work particular area within organization
finance training research etc
Operating virtually different geographical location team exist perform regular ongoing task
Service team geographically located different assigned particular service customer support network upgrade data maintenance etc
Each team work providing particular service daylight hour end day work delegated next team operates different timezone someone handling service hour day
Offshore ISD outsourcing team independent service provider team company subcontract portion work
These team usually work conjunction onshore team
Offshore ISD commonly used software development well international R D project
According The life circle includes five stage The initial task implementation team definition general purpose team together determination level virtuality might appropriate achieve goal
These decision usually determined strategic factor merger increase market span cost reduction flexibility reactivity market etc
activity take place preparation phase includes mission statement personnel selection task design reward system design choose appropriate technology organizational integration
It highly recommended beginning virtual teamwork member meet
Crucial element workshop getting acquainted team member clarifying team goal clarifying role function team member information training communication technology used efficiently developing general rule teamwork
As consequence workshop expected promote clarification team process trust building building shared interpretative context high identification team
Getting acquainted goal clarification development rule also accomplished phase
Initial field data compare virtual team without meeting confirm general positive effect team effectiveness although differentiated research necessary
Experimental study demonstrate getting acquainted start work facilitates cooperation trust
After launch virtual team work effectiveness constructive team climate maintained using performance management strategy
The following discussion restricted issue empirical result already available
These issue leadership communication within virtual team team member motivation knowledge management
Leadership central challenge virtual team
Particularly kind direct control difficult team manager location team member
As consequence delegative management principle considered shift part classic managerial function team member
However team member accept fulfill managerial function motivated identify team goal difficult achieve virtual team
Next empirical result three leadership approach summarized differ degree autonomy team member Electronic monitoring attempt realize directive leadership distance management objective MBO example delegative leadership principle team example rather autonomous teamwork
Communication process perhaps frequently investigated variable relevant regulation virtual teamwork
By definition communication virtual team predominantly based electronic medium telephone etc
The main concern electronic medium reduce richness information exchange compared communication
Predominant research issue conflict escalation disinhibited communication flaming fit communication medium communication content role communication
One important need successful communication ability every member group together repeatedly time
Effective dispersed group show spike presence communication time ineffective group dramatic spike
For management motivational emotional process three group process addressed empirical investigation far motivation trust team identification cohesion satisfaction team member
Since variable originated within person vary considerably among member team requiring appropriate aggregation procedure multilevel analysis
motivation may mediated interpersonal trust
Systematic research needed management knowledge development shared understanding within team particularly since theoretical analysis sometimes lead conflicting expectation
The development common ground might particularly difficult virtual team sharing information development transactive memory know team harder due reduced amount communication reduced information individual work context
Virtual team supported personnel team development intervention
The development training concept based empirical assessment need deficit team member effectiveness training evaluated empirically
The step team development include assessment individual team training evaluation training effect
Finally disbanding virtual team team member important issue neglected empirical also conceptual work virtual team
However particularly virtual project team short reform quickly careful constructive disbanding mandatory order maintain high motivation satisfaction among employee
Members transient project team anticipate end teamwork foreseeable future turn overshadows interaction shared outcome
The final stage group development gradual emotional disengagement includes sadness separation least successful group joy pride achievement team
Cultural diversity shown affect group positive team
Combined collaborative group individual different cultural perspective likely actively participate group decision making
The differing background experience group member also encourage creativity create conflicting viewpoint make likely multiple option explored considered
The side coin virtual team create equal workplace discouraging age race disability discrimination forcing individual interact others whose difference challenge assumption
Physically disadvantaged employee also able participate team communication virtual may previously able due physical limitation office workspace
Virtual team required use technology communicate side effect mitigating problem
For instance email medium communication transfer accent carry fewer noticeable verbal language difference voice communication
Cultural barrier removed team instead shielded view situation irrelevant
In fact simply understanding diversity within team working way around strengthen relationship team member different culture
Virtual team save travel time cost significant expense business multiple location client located multiple place
They also reduce disruption normal workday requiring individual physically leave workspace
This improved efficiency also directly translate saved cost company
A company able recruit larger pool employee using virtual team people increasingly unwilling relocate new job
A growing amount talent would otherwise unobtainable without employee traveling often
The use virtual team also allows employee participate multiple project within company located different site
This turn help company allowing reuse existing resource required hire new employee job
It common cultural difference come global team
Cultural diversity also impairs communication often due language barrier cultural mismatch workplace
Satisfaction among team member virtual team shown le positive satisfaction among team
This drop satisfaction part difficult build trust without communication necessary part virtual team
However effective management adherence proper goal setting principle specific nature work virtual team require lead improved team effectiveness
If team corresponding management prepared challenge virtual team difficult achieve
rarely exists virtual team even often transferred new member contextual knowledge kept well documented
Development type particularly difficult virtual team due indirect method low frequency communication
While team meet person develop naturally virtual team often create artificially ahead time
Virtual team also highlight generational gap may older executive senior manager much experience computer technology younger counterpart
These senior member must make extra effort catch younger generation understand new way communicating
Another problem unique virtual team differing time zone
A part team one side world may asleep another part normal workday group work around
tends difficult manage requires much greater coordination
Team leader need training specifically
Given team member need able share leadership responsibility training program ought developed recognition support
A contribution problem company extensive expertise operate engage virtual team create without understanding differ regular team
Despite improvement telecommunication overcome distance obstacle collaboration working separate location still increase odds people aware
Common ground
mutual knowledge important element successful communication coordinated activity
Working separately technology make difficult detect resolve misunderstanding lack common ground
Technologies video higher medium richness provide context common ground proven effective negotiation
It important consider frequency negotiation everyday conversation
Negotiation meaning happens regularly especially people different background culture
Throughout smaller negotiation made two actor order achieve common ground seen higher medium richness fact improve common ground
The cost difficulty video high medium rich technology show disadvantage virtual collocated team
When come distance need communicate remember difference context often escape collaborator
Collaborators often assume remote partner context forget remote partner hence fail remember communicate essential contextual information remote partner
For instance many recorded case worker going offline public holiday country forget party working different area public holiday hence fail communicate holiday
This failure communicate contextual information inevitably cause misunderstanding cause people jump conclusion mistrust
Other problem include poor decision quality wasted time needed correct lack mutual knowledge
Additionally even contextual information communicated collaborator may still forget
This mean conclusion drawn lack essential contextual information causing misunderstanding
For instance team member may communicate team upcoming trip able communicate within time period
However team forgot still sent request immediate action away
When digital technology used replace communication difficult detect actual message sent received receiver vice versa
For instance collaborator two email address primary secondary one message may sent server primary address secondary address
If partner read message received primary address lot information would lost transmission working partner would different ground
These working partner would wondering message ignored others received incorrect conclusion would drawn leading misunderstanding
Since partner unaware root cause misunderstanding would long time problem brought light lot tension conclusion would drawn
Errors distribution message common technology interaction leading lack common ground
When come interaction speaker may make importance message known tone voice facial expression bodily gesture
The receiver may acknowledge understanding exact feedback called communication head nod brief verbalization like yeah okay smile
These method emphasis feedback ensure party common ground
However method absent scarce digital mean communication
For example exchange easy overlook important point message intended sender
The receiver may interpret message differently giving different part message different priority
In worse case may cause lack action salient part message receiver part
Fully implementing communication
The lack convenient cue digital communication make dispersed collaboration le conducive establishment mutual knowledge
Speed timing communication inevitably uniformed digital communication interaction
This due fact party would restricted access communication others
The difference relative speed timing feedback aggravated difference time zone
In case problem arising difference relative speed may attributed instead lack conscientiousness part slower partner
In fact fluctuating feedback cycle destructive uniformed feedback cycle slower pace
Messages met silence mean variety thing
For example silence due technical problem within technology mediates party involved communication due fact one partner town reply message
Whatever reason silence barrier establishing common ground firstly ambiguity silence
Silence ambiguous interpreted receiving partner many way
For example taken mean agreement disagreement indifference case dispersed group message undelivered
Secondly silence blur notion known unknown group signaling absence common ground

Consider familiar view field Could
Virtual team become fact business life take make work effectively
On June I launched discussion around question
The result outpouring experience advice making virtual team work
I define virtual team work group core member interact primarily electronic mean engaged interdependent task
truly team group independent worker
I distilled result combined work focus new leader ass align team first day
Because really important lay foundation superior performance team virtual otherwise
Here ten basic principle making happen It may seem paradoxical say post virtual team communication still better virtual come building relationship fostering trust essential foundation effective team work
If end world focus virtual team building
But get team together use time help team member get know better personally professionally well create shared vision set guiding principle team work
Schedule meeting early reconnect regularly annually possible
All new leader need align team goal role responsibility first day
With virtual team however coordination inherently challenge people
So important focus attention detail task design process used complete
Simplify work greatest extent possible ideally task assigned two three team member
And make sure clarity work process specific
Then periodically review evaluate thing going identify process adjustment training need
Communication virtual team often le frequent always le rich interaction provides contextual cue information emotional state engagement lack thereof
The way avoid pitfall extremely clear disciplined team communicate
Create charter establishes norm behavior participating virtual meeting limiting background noise side conversation talking clearly reasonable pace listening attentively dominating conversation
The charter also include guideline communication mode use circumstance example reply via email versus picking phone versus taking time create share document
Developments collaborative technology ranging shared workspace video conferencing unquestionably making virtual teaming easier
However selecting best technology necessarily mean going newest
It essential sacrifice reliability quest cutting edge
If team struggle get connected waste time making element collaboration suite work undermines whole endeavor
So err side robustness
Also willing sacrifice feature name everyone system
Otherwise risk creating team member undermining effectiveness
When member team working separately get disconnected normal rhythm work life
One antidote disciplined creating enforcing rhythm virtual team work
This mean example regular meeting ideally day time week
It also mean establishing sharing meeting agenda advance clear agreement communication protocol starting finishing time
If team member working different time zone place burden team member rather establish regular rotation meeting time spread load equitably
Virtual team often also team magnifies communication challenge especially member think speaking language actually
The playwright George Bernard Shaw famously described Americans British two nation divided common His quip capture challenge sustaining shared understanding across culture
When domain team work technical language science engineering often provide solid foundation effective communication
However team work task involving ambiguity example generating idea solving problem potential divergent interpretation real danger see example
Take time explicitly negotiate agreement shared interpretation important word phrase example say yes say post shared workspace
The image gathering around water cooler share information reinforce social bond
Absent explicit effort create virtual water cooler team meeting tend become mean important information may shared team cohesion may weaken
One simple way avoid start meeting member take couple minute discus going well challenging
Regular virtual exercise another way inject bit fun proceeding
Also enterprise collaboration platform increasingly combining shared workspace help team member feel connected
In classic HBR article William Oncken Donald Wass use metaphor exhort leader push accountability team
When team work remotely however inherently difficult easy way observe engagement productivity
As partly addressed carefully designing task regular status meeting
Beyond help explicit getting team member commit define intermediate milestone track progress
One useful tool deliverable dashboard visible team member whatever collaborative hub using
If create though take care end practicing virtual
There fine line appropriate tracking commitment overbearing demotivating oversight
Defining deliverable tracking commitment provides push keep team member focused productive shared leadership provides crucial Find way involve others leading team
Examples include assigning responsibility special project identifying sharing best practice getting member coach others area expertise assigning mentor help new team member asking run virtual exercise
By sharing leadership increase engagement also take burden shoulder
Leaders performance management coaching interaction team member fundamental part making team work
Make interaction regular part virtual team rhythm using check status provide feedback keep member connected vision highlight part story together
Finally inheriting team take time understand predecessor led
It essential newly appointed leader whether team virtual
Because put must study past would define It even important homework inherit virtual team structure process used manage communication coordinate work inordinate impact team performance
You use ten principle checklist diagnosing previous leader ran team help identify prioritize need first day

In computing computer system
Virtual machine based provide functionality physical computer
Their implementation may involve specialized hardware software combination
There different kind virtual machine different function Some virtual machine designed also emulate different architecture allow execution software application operating system written another architecture
allows resource computer partitioned via support multiple isolated instance usually called may look feel like real machine
A VM originally defined efficient isolated duplicate real computer machine
Current use includes virtual machine direct correspondence real hardware
The desire run multiple operating system initial motive virtual machine allow among several operating system
In respect system virtual machine considered generalization concept historically preceded
IBM first system allow implemented providing user operating system CMS
Unlike virtual memory system virtual machine entitled user write privileged instruction code
This approach certain advantage adding device allowed standard system
As technology evolves virtual memory purpose virtualization new system may applied manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machine one computer operating system
It may possible share identical content among multiple virtual machine run physical machine may result mapping physical page technique termed
This especially useful page holding code segment case multiple virtual machine running similar software software library web server middleware component etc
The guest operating system need compliant host hardware thus making possible run different operating system computer prior version operating system support future software
The use virtual machine support separate guest operating system popular regard
A typical use would run simultaneously preferred complex operating system Linux Windows
Another use would novel unproven software still developmental stage run inside
Virtual machine advantage operating system development may include improved debugging access faster reboots
Multiple VMs running guest operating system frequently engaged server consolidation
A process VM sometimes called MRE run normal application inside host OS support single process
It created process started destroyed exit
Its purpose provide programming environment abstract away detail underlying hardware operating system allows program execute way platform
A process VM provides abstraction compared ISA abstraction system VM
Process VMs implemented using performance comparable compiled programming language achieved use
This type VM become popular implemented using
Other example include run VM called
All serve computer language
A special case process VMs system abstract communication mechanism potentially heterogeneous
Such VM consist single process one process per physical machine cluster
They designed ease task programming concurrent application letting programmer focus algorithm rather communication mechanism provided interconnect OS
They hide fact communication take place attempt present cluster single machine
Unlike process VMs system provide specific programming language embedded existing language typically system provides binding several language
Examples PVM MPI
They strictly virtual machine application running top still access OS service therefore confined system model
Both system virtual machine process virtual machine date continue area active development
grew notably implemented CTSS
allowed multiple user use computer program appeared full access machine one program executed time system switching program time slice saving restoring state time
This evolved virtual machine notably via IBM research system used used early example
The first widely available virtual machine architecture see detail
An important distinction using multiple virtual machine one host system using one virtual machine host system prototyping SIMMON
hardware emulation earlier system compatibility date back software emulation simulation predates
arose originally abstract platform used program early example date around
An early example virtual machine executes object code emitted compiler
This abstraction allowed compiler easily ported new architecture implementing new took existing compiled machine code underlying physical machine
The language used similar design intermediate language named portable
This popularized around notably system compiler termed resulting machine
This influential virtual machine sense often generally called machine
In addition intermediate language Pascal also executed directly interpreter implementing virtual machine notably influenced later interpreter notably JVM
Another early example written SNOBOL Implementation Language SIL assembly language virtual machine targeted physical machine transpiling native assembler via
Macros since fallen favor however approach le influential
Process virtual machine popular approach implementing early microcomputer software including adventure game implementation engine like argues possibly portable virtual machine ever created
Significant advance occurred implementation particularly implementation pushed forward implementation approach us process virtual machine
Later notable Smalltalk VMs
A related language produced lot virtual machine innovation programming language pioneered
These technique proved commercially successful Java virtual machine
Other innovation include virtual machine better match underlying hardware rather virtual machine closer match programming language pioneered language
In full virtualization virtual machine simulates enough hardware allow unmodified guest OS one designed run isolation
This approach pioneered IBM predecessor family
Examples outside mainframe field include discontinued formerly called GSX Server vBlade technology
In virtualization hardware provides architectural support facilitates building virtual machine monitor allows guest OSes run isolation
virtualization first introduced IBM use first virtual machine operating system
In provided additional hardware support virtualization
Sun Microsystems added similar feature processor
Examples virtualization platform adapted hardware include
In hardware support found rarely offer performance advantage software virtualization
In virtualization physical server virtualized operating system level enabling multiple isolated secure virtualized server run single physical server
The guest operating system environment share running instance operating system host system
Thus also used implement guest environment application running given guest environment view system
The pioneer implementation example include AIX Parallels Virtuozzo Containers

New research suggests stereotypical programmer Trek poster empty Mountain can according significant reason woman entering computer science discipline field
While formal training chemical engineer I programming since parent enrolled computer camp I eight many friend home
In intervening year I probably count one hand number time computer workspace clean opposed looking like bomb went never looked like sophomore male dorm room except second year college I took computer science class
Where STEM field Science Technology Engineering Mathematics seeing percentage woman enrolled increase computer science going decline
The study published find feeling ambient sense well one feel fit woman computer science
When people think computer science image immediately pop many mind computer geek surrounded thing computer game science fiction memorabilia junk food said Sapna Cheryan University Washington assistant professor psychology
The author describe feeling one garnered first impression space
You look object make instant appraisal would fit object people typically found environment
You also make judgment like belong said Cheryan
To ass feeling author set series four experiment designed aid understanding whether stereotypical surroundings may cause woman choose field study computer science
The participant male female student enrolled computer science course study ushered classroom either filled stereotypical computer science object one generic crap
They told room shared another class minute asked fill questionnaire probing feeling room
The survey found woman sat stereotypically decorated room expressed le interest computer science sat control room
Men hand show similar drop interest
This lead researcher conclude choice class even major influenced simply decor office classroom lab department
In continuation theme researcher conducted three similar experiment
When faced choice joining one two team difference object found team versus overwhelmingly percent time choose work team based nonstereotypically decorated room
When men woman asked job offer two company gender ratio one decorated usual computer science gear generic stuff gender preferred nonstereotypical setting woman men
The final experiment probed thought working nondescript Web design company woman would choose work environment decorated stereotypical computer science way
The work show definitive trend nontechnical people liking work environment stuff male would hanging wall room
However outside occasional computer science TAs office undergraduate dorm room I see stereotypical setup seems well latter three experimental setup
While personal workspace may look like utter mess image company I visited worked interviewed whole project potential hire customer
Judging simply image accompanies article brightly colored poster game box strongly draw one eye designed
I would curious disparity ambient belonging remains even two focal object removed stereotypical computer science workspace
Technical book paper one thing huge color poster unrelated video game I would consider present sort professional environment short movie studio game development office I would think appropriate general use classroom University
Prior work shown kid teen extension I wager young adult actually feel common stereotype work STEM field
While I agree certain aspect technical field individual know arrogant jerk revel smug superiority unenlightened shown large people interested someone give time day answer question
Many STEM field suffer type problem
A group adequately represented teaching position definition present mentor new people group hence perpetuating cycle hard break
While cleaning first impression may perceived outside new field help instantly resolve underlying issue
As cryand competent technical individual increase however every little bit information help bring people good

I adding snapshot stream repository workspace
How I load snapshot component repository
Currently I repository workspace snapshot workspace also contain component snapshot
To add snapshot repository I use Perhaps I using different scm command add component snapshot repository instead snapshot
I used
I need use id
No error returned I view created snapshot But component snapshot added repository workspace
I think ive solved
Running command includes stream parameter Creates workspace add component newly created workspace
These component created workspace baseline defined stream
create snapshot stream order link component When add snapshot repo workspace promote snapshot mention work sure need id repo workspace id snapshot Actually commented The snapshot used
The idea though populate another empty stream order repo workspace reflect list component
If component already stream enough No need create promote snapshot case since stream already reflect component want
You see Component section workspace component
Note still need repo workspace order see file disk

Some file server used school support SnapShot technology
In essence provides point time representation file assist retrieving file may inadvertantly deleted corrupted
The snapshot used place backup reccomended take regular basis
In particular storing home directory support technology
Snapshots use filestore quota
The automatically manages snapshot take periodic interval rolling basis So example currently Tuesday snapshot follows Snapshots presented user Windows different way
You access snapshot directory may visible l command The snapshot recover file must copy back
Under Windows snapshot directory called may hidden file Windows Explorer The snapshot recover file must copy back
Under Windows snapshot also provided previous version
You access right clicking directory selecting property
You select Previous Versions tab You presented list snapshot available directory shown time date snapshot taken use Restore button recover whole directory Copy copy snapshot new location View view content snapshot could choose copy back single file
When using restore option directory returned state snapshot taken

I often need take screenshots window larger currently shown desktop
I Ubuntu say Version say Compiz I four virtual arranged The image obtained moving separate workspace taking screenshot via PrintScreen key say
I aware better way obtaining shot like Page Saver addon taken simply example generic oversized window
EDIT I apparently using wrong nomenclature turn example I one workspace changed instead viewport show virtual desktop Obviously moving virtual desktop taking screenshot stitching together finally cutting application window bit tedious I wandering tool preferably command line would allow pick window larger current desktop take screenshot entire content one go
There could two scenario well The first case possible way manually I second case I guess possible application either move window briefly total area create virtual graphic context shown screen render window although I know enough detail know sure
I tried following tool far capture corner entire application window shown current desktop situation shown
When trying capture root capture currently rendered desktop total area virtual desktop
I also tried I found information version onwards capture virtual desktop
Shutter go take picture every one compose one large screenshot I give try clicking Capture Workspaces take shot current window capture likewise cut limit current desktop fail window fully sits virtual desktop current one
Then I read screenshot plugin since manages virtual desktop I thought could handle total area setting CompizConfig setting manager Enable plugin output directory button enable set hotkeys Initiate rectangle screenshot since apparently thing drag mouse specify rectangular area I doubt plugin would help capturing total area one go
Thus I like ask suggestion tool I would prefer something deal stuff memory I could come something worse script sends keystroke change desktop take individual screenshots would pain use especially since I visually exposed desktop switching screenshot capture
If complete program suggestion APIs access bitmap data virtual desktop would great
Ok found X window As ca access window take picture current viewport window current page unmapped
This true one change window unmapped window current viewport remapped
So I guess mean I want impossible
Although two workarounds This work first query see output want execute see also Got via also see example
This worked command go terminal meant service The problem part OS initialized window decoration basic X font although apps may find font seen look almost ideal since I could basically set invisible environment big I want take screenshots directly using
The problem I window switch screenshotting bring back
Then one must set application specifically happens need size whole chain need restarted
On hand I find working workspace large viewports shwere mouse move around within viewport bit confusing change size fly nothing need restarted plus I use usual screenshot tool I still switch viewports
Needless say I still love hear possible command line solution could kind screenshotting one go On FreeBSD workstation I created bash script capture multiple virtual workspace run result ImageMagic stitch
Here bash script Here command I run directory stitch together Obviously one would change one system
One need installed bash maim equivalent xdotool ImageMagick montage solution

In system particular point time
The term coined analogy
It refer state system capability provided certain system
A full large data set may take long time complete
On may writes data backed
This prevents backup introduces may result
For example user move file directory already backed file would completely missing since backup operation already taken place addition file
Version skew may also cause corruption file change size content underfoot read
One safely backing live data temporarily disable write access data backup either stopping accessing application using provided operating system enforce exclusive read access
This tolerable system desktop computer small workgroup server regular acceptable
system however bear service stoppage
To avoid downtime system may instead perform backup copy data set frozen allow application continue writing data
Most snapshot implementation efficient create snapshot
In word time needed create snapshot increase size data set contrast time required direct backup proportional size data set
In system initial snapshot taken data set subsequent snapshot copy changed data use system pointer reference initial snapshot
This method snapshot consumes le disk capacity data set repeatedly cloned
Some Unix system
These implement entire copying changed overwritten within parent storage thus preserving past image block device
Filesystems snapshot image later mounted medium
Some volume manager also allow creation snapshot extending approach disassociating block modified within snapshot parent block original volume
Such scheme could also described performing additional operation triggered writes snapshot
On Linux LVM allows creation snapshot
Writable snapshot introduced LVM version
Some file system internally track old version file make snapshot available special
Others like provide operating system accessing file history
In access snapshot provided Volume Service VSS
provides snapshot via VSS interface shared storage
Snapshots also available NSS file system since version recently platform product
EMC Isilon OneFS clustered storage platform implement single scalable file system support snapshot file directory level
Any file directory within file system snapshotted system implement snapshot dynamically based method determined optimal system
On Linux file system support creating snapshot cloning individual file
Additionally Btrfs also support creation snapshot subvolumes
On AIX also support snapshot
hybrid implementation track snapshot block level make branched file set nameable user application clone
included snapshotting scheme incremental backup service merely watch mounted volume change copy changed file periodically volume using

New graduate student engineering computer science come variety background
Those entering graduate school immediately achieving undergraduate degree may experience finding kind book paper needed undergraduate liberal art class may little exposure literature need graduate program
Students returning school year workplace may know standard trade resource used engineering work may comfortable conference paper journal article
Over time graduate student achieve degree fluency literature need research
Engineering librarian decrease time fluency building knowledge past student cited research sharing knowledge student
At time increase credibility engineering faculty administration position informed collection development
As liaison librarian Aerospace Engineering Mechanics AEM Electrical Computer Engineering ECE Computer Science Engineering CS I began project mean determining new graduate student needed know literature field order provide effective instruction user service
I analyzed citation bibliography dissertation thesis three department published period
The result show difference type discipline age material used graduate student researcher department
The University Minnesota public research university enrolled student
The University College Science Engineering includes academic department enrolled undergraduate graduate student
Table list number faculty member undergraduate graduate student department included study
A small percentage student seek individual librarian consultation program liaison librarian must find creative way become familiar different type research occurring department kind literature researcher student level need
By reviewing bibliography dissertation thesis completed recent past author sought answer research question Citation analysis process gathering citation set source document separating component part aggregating part highlight trend material type journal title age factor
Many librarian undertake citation analysis local level way evaluating past collection development practice informing future decision regarding collection
Hoffmann Doucette reviewed method used study published alone
All user study study particular user group citation practice sought inform collection practice
Hoffmann Ducette caution approaching citation analysis project consider objective choose data analyzed accordingly
Their appendix Guide Considerations Citation Analysis Methodologies offer suggestion defining scope study
Thinking decision confronting mountain citation save researcher time allow creation consistent streamlined dataset
Careful consideration method help researcher avoid problem pitfall cited critic citation analysis
MacRoberts MacRoberts point interpretation bibliography list influence
They argue among issue author sample cite formal influence rarely cited informal influence
Beile et al
used citation education dissertation three institution build core journal list institution well composite list
They found composite list quite different individual list
While bolstering contention local citation analysis necessary understand practice local researcher finding demonstrates citation analysis study necessarily generalized
The study also revealed institution collection included vast majority citation author institution
The author argue finding may easily indicate researcher local collection indicates quality collection
Even stated objective citation analysis study inform collection development effort often result improvement user service
Kirkwood able demonstrate need fund purchase monographic material civil engineering student also found training experience graduate assistant gained collecting data made effective reference desk
In addition process brought light tool skill new graduate student taught
Knowing type age range literature used researcher discipline key understanding cultural norm discipline
Armed understanding discipline use literature librarian work academic advisor others educate new student norm
Many citation analysis study identified difference among discipline among field within discipline
Knievel Kellsey demonstrated nearly three quarter citation humanity journal article analyzed monograph percentage citation monograph varied greatly among eight discipline investigated
Walcott analysis biology thesis dissertation institution showed high use serial monograph
Goodrum et al
Rahm Wainer et al
contend conference publication held higher regard Computer Science field
Thompson note importance grey literature engineering well continuing use older technical report National Advisory Committee Aeronautics NACA National Aeronautics Space Administration NASA
Because primary objective study determine new graduate student engineering computer science need know study analyzed bibliography written work successful graduate student likely complete thesis dissertation
Masters thesis dissertation three department calendar year identified using ProQuest Dissertations Theses database University Minnesota institutional repository University Digital Conservancy UDC
Only dissertation thesis available full text one two online source included analysis
Counts department shown Table
Most Master student engineering computer science choose path thesis count reflect number degree awarded
Because small number thesis relative dissertation study compared average citation count made comparison citation one versus
Lists source document department generated using utility Needlebase exporting search result RefWorks
Given large number source document author experimented several mean automatically harvesting citation rather manually transcribing
The process used involved copying pasting bibliography Microsoft Word document using Visual Basic Applications VBA code parse citation individual table row import Microsoft Access
For description process see white paper Parsing Citations using Visual Basic Applications A Guide
Data element collected source document included title date submitted department advisor author
Data element collected citation included text citation literature type publication year journal conference title applicable
Table show number citation well average department
In order provide rich picture literature use possible citation assigned one literature type
For analysis type aggregated seven summary literature type Literature type determined using UlrichsWeb title found searching Google Scholar article title inspecting article required information
UlrichsWeb OCLC WorldCat provided ISSN publisher Library Congress classification journal
Overall graduate student three department cited article academic journal often anything else shown Table
Books accounted percent citation
This consistent Musser Conkling analysis citation engineering journal In work journal comprised percent citation monograph accounted percent
By contrast although Miller analysis biology thesis showed similar use book percent student study referenced journal article percent time conference paper scant percent
Kayongo Helm noted dissertation writer art humanity Notre Dame cited book percent time percent social science scholar citation book
Although journal article conference paper cited much often book engineering computer science analysis data showed marked difference among three department Figure
Computer scientist likely cite conference paper percent literature type including journal article percent
Unlike academic discipline conference publication computer science considered least par superior journal publication
Aerospace Engineering student likely use report Computer Science Electrical Engineering
Although citation exceptionally high relative literature type percent citing report common Of source document Aerospace Engineering cited least one report
Reports commonly AIAA Papers report
During data gathering phase became apparent computer scientist cited literature discipline student two department
Therefore Library Congress classification journal cited collected analyzed
Figure illustrates relatively large number citation journal outside Science Technology computer science student
Note Computer Science classified Library Congress Science within Mathematics subclass
This account high number citation journal classified Mathematics relative science shown Table
Journals cited Physiology largely Natural bioinformatics molecular biology
Computer Science scholar also drew material discipline outside Science Technology Table
About percent social science journal cited related statistic
As Physiology Natural journal Science classification journal classified Medicine mostly related neuroscience bioinformatics molecular biology
Philosophy Psychology Religion journal fell entirely Psychology subclass including cognitive science
Language Literature title related linguistics
Aerospace Engineering journal cited predominantly Science classification
This surprising since subclass Aeronautics Astronautics TL Technology classification
Journals Science classification fell Mathematics Physics subclass
The highly cited journal area Journal Fluid Mechanics Physics Fluids Experiments Fluids
The University Aerospace Engineering Mechanics department strong Fluid Mechanics research area worth noting citation three journal came seven source document two dissertation accounting Table
As literature type journal classification age profile material used differs department
The average Computer Science Electrical Engineering shown Table similar average age Aerospace Engineering literature substantially older type listed
This imply Aerospace Engineering student cited older literature percent conference paper journal article cited six year four year old respectively
Those age similar percent mark Computer Science Electrical Engineering citation
But aerospace engineering material appear longer shelf life
percent journal article cited year old
Aerospace Engineering student use older literature bear examination particularly relates report
As noted Thompson NASA precursor NACA conducted great deal basic research area surrounding flight space travel
Reports research still valuable field today
Citation count spike year mark year mark
The first includes NACA work wing airfoil section
The second set citation includes research boundary layer heat transfer would particularly important spacecraft launch reentry
Because Master PhD student use cite material outside LC subclass discipline therefore outside scope discipline author examined average age journal subclass dissertation writer discipline compared overall average age journal discipline
The data subclass scattered particularly since many subclass one two associated citation
Table show selection subclass discipline comparison
As assumed outset study graduate student engineering computer science overall cited academic journal article often type literature
However true discipline Computer Science student cited conference paper frequently journal article
Conference paper generally considered grey literature increasingly findable web conference web site sponsoring society database institutional repository
It may Fortnow suggests computer science researcher join rest academy move toward polished journal article standard citation
But time seems likely field electrical engineering increasingly accept conference paper mode sharing new research place le emphasis journal article
More longitudinal research across different type publication needed determine whether trend exists
In light future need journal article conference paper engineering computer science graduate student taught search literature licensed database well Google Scholar society publisher web site
They understand search tool provide efficient path particular literature need find either particular item citation everything topic
All liaison collection responsibility spend selection time book
Selectors engineering computer science aware spend time managing serial collection book study indicates time allocation appropriate
The data study help explain others library system engineering selector need process differ many colleague
In addition highlighting heavy use journal article conference paper across engineering discipline studied data show importance report aerospace engineering student
Many NACA NASA AIAA report commonly used aerospace engineering available online
But many available University Minnesota microfiche form
Liaisons help introduce student culture literature field offering instruction find use paper digitized
The wide range literature cited particularly computer science support Tucci assertion interdisciplinary work may well present librarian excellent opportunity convince faculty member practicing librarian critical knowledge skill help improve efficiency effectiveness research
Clearly librarian working within liaison subject specialist model must make point learning educating colleague wide range discipline outside subject area
Liaisons instructing new graduate student need school use literature every possibly overlapping field gain knowledge
But make student aware difference well database exist librarian available within institution help connect interdisciplinary information need
Because budget cut new material may relevant beyond strict department boundary selector need make faculty aware decision collection particularly journal subscription subject area
The data imply conclude age profile useful literature field may differ age profile literature used within student discipline
For example possible computer scientist working biology research would need older biology review article scholar working full time biology
More study needed determine whether scholar particular field use literature way outside field use
Although analysis discussed portrays certain profile use department studied profile interpreted complete model research discipline either general University Minnesota
Aspects data particularly relates interdisciplinary research may reflect research grant activity lab happened produce higher number dissertation thesis timeframe covered
It important understand area use literature discipline others le important know discipline University Minnesota timeframe
Conducting study deepened knowledge subject area
But importantly study result changed way I orient new graduate student finding literature field
I present finding fall orientation session department new student notably type literature used field diversity subject area used computer science use older report aerospace engineering
The final result provide snapshot help new student understand need know begin information gathering process demonstrate engineering different discipline differ one another
At time citation analysis thesis dissertation one tool understanding literature used field
Some writer source document continue academia produce writing likely draw type literature
But vast majority Master recipient half doctoral engineer computer scientist work private sector
A study Jeffryes Lafferty used survey focus group made University Minnesota undergraduate participated cooperative education program
Their summary type literature student asked use job comfort level finding using literature provides second perspective student taught engineering resource prepare workplace
For example research showed three quarter student primarily Mechanical Engineering department asked find use standard
This literature type obviously important engineering often cited thesis dissertation field studied
This second study provides needed balance study described
Liaisons use study others like build curriculum introduce student level culture field

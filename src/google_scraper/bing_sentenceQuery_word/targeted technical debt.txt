Technical debt concept programming reflects extra development work arises code easy implement short run used instead applying best overall solution
Technical debt commonly associated extreme programming especially context refactoring
That implies restructuring existing code refactoring required part development process
Under line thinking refactoring result poorly written code also done based evolving understanding problem best way solve problem
Technical debt may also known design debt
The term coined Ward Cunningham programmer also known developing first debt metaphor equates software development financial debt
Imagine project two potential option
One quick easy require modification future
The better design take time implement
In development releasing code quick easy approach like incurring debt come obligation interest technical debt come form extra work future
Taking time refactor equivalent paying principal
While take time short run also decrease future interest payment
Ward Cunningham describes concept follows The concept mean debt never incurred
Just leverage help company used correctly quick solution mean faster time market software development
In addition technical debt poor code
Bad code bad code technical debt result work good programmer unrealistic project constraint

However configuring maintaining system highly complex making challenging achieve high reliability
Resource constrained software team facing business pressure tempted take design shortcut order deliver business functionality quickly
These design shortcut maintenance activity contribute accumulation technical debt buildup software maintenance obligation need addressed future
We model empirically analyze impact technical debt system reliability utilizing longitudinal dataset spanning year lifecycle commercial enterprise system deployed different client firm
We use competing risk analysis approach discern interdependency client vendor maintenance activity
This allows u ass effect problematic client modification client error software error present platform vendor error system failure
We also examine relative effect modular architectural maintenance activity undertaken client order analyze dynamic technical debt reduction
The result analysis first establish technical debt decrease reliability enterprise system
Second modular maintenance targeted reduce technical debt effective architectural maintenance reducing probability system failure due client error increasing chance system failure due vendor error architectural maintenance activity
Using empirical result illustrate firm could evaluate business risk exposure due technical debt accumulation enterprise system ass estimated net effect positive negative range software maintenance practice

Many vulnerability solution figure medical device security involve analog cybersecurity
Cybersecurity risk begin analog world infect digital world exploiting semipermeable digital abstraction
Analog cybersecurity focus research side channel fault injection attack transcend traditional boundary computation
Security problem tend occur boundary condition different abstraction meet
In particular abstraction pose subtle security weakness cyberphysical system medical device Internet Things

The greatest risk old malware accidentally break clinical system running old operating system causing damage integrity availability medical device turn interrupting clinical workflow patient care
While targeted malware likely become problem future medical device currently challenged basic cybersecurity hygiene hospital spreading malware USB drive vendor infecting product accident
To enhance trustworthiness emerging medical device patient confidence manufacturer need address cybersecurity risk initial engineering design maintain postmarket surveillance throughout product lifecycle

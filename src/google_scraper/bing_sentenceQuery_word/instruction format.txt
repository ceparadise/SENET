A computer program perform specific task executed computer
Before program start executing need translated machine language loaded random access memory computer
Then CPU fetch one instruction RAM one decodes understands executes
An instruction divided number
A consists anumber micro operation
A micro operation operation performed data stored register CPU arithmetic logical shift operation
Thus defined whichdescribes sequence micro operation performed computer
The computer instruction converted known
Hence instruction code give instruction computer perform specific task
The instruction code comprises
The Opcode specifies performed instruction addition subtraction multiplication etc
The operation specified Opcode performed known operand instruction
For example write instruction value variable x CPU register add x
The instruction code instruction would specifies add operation specifies address variable x
Computer Registers instruction memory location data
Sometimes also used part instruction
The input data output result instruction often stored register
Every register specific name function associated example DR Data Register AC Accumulator AR Address Register IR Instruction Register PC Program Counter
Instruction format every instruction computer need specified
It help determining instruction
Also instruction format help CPU determining length value memory location instruction
Hence instruction format considered format specify
The instruction format comprises following The address pert instruction format specifies address used instruction
The address directly specifies location operand computation type instruction known
The Opcode specifies performed instruction addition subtraction multiplication etc
An Opcode must bit distinct operation
It part Opcode specifies way instruction
We calculate effective address instruction help addressing mode
The addressing denoted instruction format
If computer capacity word bit memory location identified bit
Also instruction code would bit
So Opcode bit perform operation
Hence instruction format An instruction one following address type An instruction said direct address part instruction code contains actual address operand
The direct address instruction
For example instruction ADD direct mode add content memory location content accumulator
Here operand
An instruction said indirect address address part instruction code contains address memory location contains actual address operand
The indirect address instruction
For example instruction ADD indirect mode add content memory location present address content accumulator
The actual address operand present memory location
Here operand
An instruction said immediate address address part instruction code contains operand
The instruction immediate address
For Example instruction MOV A move data accumulator
Here present instruction
This type instruction contains
It used stack organized computer
The push pop operation used move operand memory fetch result memory
This type instruction contains
It us data manipulation
All operation performed memory operand accumulator
This type instruction contains
Both address field specify memory location processor register
It assumes result instruction stored address first operand instruction
This type instruction contains
Each field contain memory location processor register
The usage instruction reduces program size binary code many bit instruction code
Push W Push X Add Push Y Push Z Add Mul Pop I Top W Top X Top W X Top Y Top Z Top Z Top Y Z W X M I Top LDA W ADD X STA A LDA Y ADD Z MUL A STA I AC W AC AC X A AC AC Y AC AC Z AC AC A I AC MOV W ADD X MOV Y ADD Z MUL MOV I W X Y Z M I ADD W X ADD Y Z MUL I W X Y Z M I In implied addressing mode address operand instruction
The instruction code contains part
It also known
For example clear accumulator instruction clear content accumulator
Hence effective address instruction implied instruction EA AC
All implied mode instruction
In immediate addressing mode address part instruction specifies operand
Such instruction requires executes much faster
For example MUL instruction multiply content accumulator
An immediate mode instruction
An instruction memory direct addressing mode address part instruction format contains
Such instruction requires fetch data operand memory location
The effective address memory direct instruction would address mentioned instruction
ADD X add content data present location X accumulator
Hence effective address An instruction memory indirect addressing mode address part instruction contains address memory location contains actual address operand
It requires fetch data memory
Hence slower type instruction
instruction ADD X indirect addressing mode mean X contains memory location actual address operand present
So first need access location specified X need access location specified memory location fetch operand
Hence address found memory location An instruction register direct addressing mode address part instruction contains
The operand instruction resides register
Such instruction requires direct mode instruction well
But limited number register processor use mode often
The register direct instruction specified register
MUL R instruction multiplies content register R accumulator
Hence EA An instruction register indirect mode address part instruction contains register contains actualaddress
Hence need access memory location specified register fetch operand
Such instruction requires le number memory access
The instruction would address operand present register
instruction MUL R register indirect addressing mode mean register R contains address operand
An instruction register indirect mode address part instruction contains register contains actualaddress
Hence need access memory location specified register fetch operand
Such instruction requires le number memory access
The instruction would address operand present register
instruction MUL R register indirect addressing mode mean register R contains address operand
An instruction auto mode register indirect instruction content register either execution instruction execution instruction
The instruction address specified register
instruction CLR R clear content memory location specified register R increment content register hold next memory address
In relative addressing mode instruction calculated addition address next instruction executed address specified address part instruction also called offset
The register contains address next instruction executed
Hence PC address specified instruction
The obtained actual address operand
content PC address provided instruction In base register addressing mode instruction calculated addition content address specified address part instruction
The base register contains data operand address part instruction provides
Hence result obtained actual address operand
content base register address specified EA
The instruction code address part contains operand known
We access memory either directly indirectly hence addressing mode could either
For example AND ADD LDA memory reference instruction
The instruction code address part contains known
Hence operand register reference instruction stored
The operation directly performed register needed hence mode bit equal zero
CLA CLE INC register reference instruction
The instruction code address part specifies operation known reference instruction
The mode bit always case reference instruction
INP OUT reference instruction

The MIPS ISA instruction fall three category
Not ISAs divide instruction neatly
This one reason study MIPS first assembly language
The format simple
This format instruction encoded machine code
The prototypical instruction rd refers register shown variable however use instruction must put number inclusive
also register
The semantics instruction addition signed addition
You notice order register instruction destination register followed two source register
However actual binary format shown table store two source register first destination register
Thus assembly language programmer us instruction instruction stored binary always match
Let explain field instruction
Opcode short operation code
The opcode binary encoding instruction
Opcodes seen ISAs
In MIPS opcode
The opcode MIPS ISA bit
Ordinarily mean possible instruction
Even RISC ISA typically instruction quite small
For instruction additional bit used B called
Thus bit opcode bit function specify kind instruction instruction
This
The destination register register result operation stored
This first
The source register register hold one argument operation
This second
The amount bit shift
Used shift instruction
An additional bit used specify operation addition opcode
The prototypical instruction look like In case destination register source register
It unusual used appear bit position instruction
Presumably designer MIPS ISA reason making destination register particular location
The semantics instruction IR refers instruction register register current instruction stored
IR mean bit instruction register sign bit immediate value repeated time
This followed IR bit immediate value
Basically semantics say immediate value bit add using signed addition register store result register
The prototypical instruction look like The semantics instruction mean jump PC program counter store current address instruction executed
You update PC using upper bit program counter followed bit target lower bit instruction register followed two creates bit address
The jump instruction explained detail future set note
MIPS support integer register
To specify register register identified number
It take bit specify one register
If MIPS register would need bit specify register
The register number specified using unsigned binary
Thus refers refers register
Furthermore begin realize information instruction store
For example obvious immediate value stored part instruction If know example signed addition also conclude immediate value represented
Also add immediate value register value would mean immediate value bit
However instruction encode bit immediate
For example add immediate unsigned interprets bit UB
It immediate add value stored bit register
How manage
Here example instruction One way reduce total number operand make one operand source destination register
Another approach use implicit register
For example may special register called
This register mentioned explicitly instruction
Instead implied opcode
Early personal computer Apple used ISAs register register often part instruction thus specified
With memory becoming cheaper memory access becoming cheaper become easier devote bit instruction specify three operand instead two
This make convenient assembly language programmer

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
An instruction order given computer
At lowest level instruction sequence describes physical operation computer perform Add depending particular instruction type specification special storage area called may contain data used carrying instruction location computer data
In computer language language statement generally corresponds single processor instruction
In language language statement generally result program compilation multiple processor instruction
In assembler language one processing assembler program expands become multiple instruction based previously coded macro definition

An abstract model
It also referred
A realization ISA called
An ISA permit multiple implementation may vary physical size monetary cost among thing ISA serf
Software written ISA run different implementation ISA
This enabled different generation computer easily achieved development computer family
Both development helped lower cost computer increase applicability
For reason ISA one important abstraction today
An ISA defines everything need know order program computer
What ISA defines differs ISAs general ISAs define supported state semantics set comprises computer machine language model
An instruction set architecture distinguished set technique used particular processor implement instruction set
Processors different microarchitectures share common instruction set
For example implement nearly identical version radically different internal design
The concept distinct design specific machine developed IBM design phase
Prior NPL company computer designer free honor cost objective selecting technology also fashioning functional architectural refinement
The SPREAD compatibility objective contrast postulated single architecture series five processor spanning wide range cost performance
None five engineering design team could count able bring adjustment architectural specification way easing difficulty achieving cost performance objective
Some support ISA Microsoft implement translating bytecode commonly used code path native machine code
In addition virtual machine execute le frequently used code path interpretation see
implemented instruction set atop processor fashion
An ISA may classified number different way
A common classification architectural
A CISC many specialized instruction may rarely used practical program
A RISC simplifies processor efficiently implementing instruction frequently used program le common operation implemented subroutine resulting additional processor execution time offset infrequent use
Other type include VLIW architecture closely related LIW EPIC architecture
These architecture seek exploit le hardware RISC CISC making responsible instruction issue scheduling
Architectures even le complexity studied MISC OISC
These theoretically important type commercialized
built discrete
On processing architecture given instruction may specify More complex operation built combining simple instruction executed sequentially otherwise directed instruction
Examples operation common many instruction set include Processors may include complex instruction instruction set
A single complex instruction something may take many instruction computer
Such instruction instruction take multiple step control multiple functional unit otherwise appear larger scale bulk simple instruction implemented given processor
Some example complex instruction include Complex instruction common CISC instruction set RISC instruction set RISC instruction set may include well
RISC instruction set generally include ALU operation memory operand instruction move large block memory RISC instruction set include instruction perform arithmetic operation multiple piece data time
SIMD instruction ability manipulating large vector matrix minimal time
SIMD instruction allow easy algorithm commonly involved sound image video processing
Various SIMD implementation brought market trade name
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifies operation perform zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In VLIW architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous opcodes operand specified single instruction
Some exotic instruction set opcode field TTA operand
The instruction set lack operand specifier field including NOSC
Conditional instruction often predicate bit encode specific condition cause operation performed rather performed
For example conditional branch instruction executed branch taken condition true execution proceeds different part program executed branch taken condition false execution continues sequentially
Some instruction set also conditional move move executed data stored target location condition true executed target location modified condition false
Similarly IBM conditional store instruction
A instruction set include predicate field every instruction called
The size length instruction varies widely little four bit many hundred bit VLIW system
Processors used instruction size bit
The longest possible instruction byte bit
Within instruction set different instruction may different length
In architecture notably RISC typically corresponding architecture
In architecture instruction variable length typically integral multiple
Some variable encoding two fixed usually encoding instruction mixed freely must switched branch exception boundary
A RISC instruction set normally fixed instruction length often byte bit whereas typical CISC instruction set may instruction widely varying length byte
instruction le complicated handle instruction several reason check whether instruction straddle cache line virtual memory page boundary instance therefore somewhat easier optimize speed
The instruction constituting program rarely specified using internal numeric form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
The design instruction set complex issue
There two stage history microprocessor
The first CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer many different instruction
In however place like IBM research found many instruction set could eliminated
The result RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture us smaller set instruction
A simpler instruction set may offer potential higher speed reduced processor size reduced power consumption
However complex set may optimize common operation improve memory efficiency simplify programming
Some instruction set designer reserve one opcodes kind
For example us us eight code CF DF EF FF use code range
Fast virtual machine much easier implement instruction set meet
The used much easier implement unprogrammed state memory interpreted
On system multiple processor algorithm much easier implement instruction set includes support something atomic
Any given instruction set implemented variety way
All way implementing particular instruction set provide implementation instruction set able run executables
The various way implementing instruction set give different tradeoff cost performance power consumption size etc
When designing processor engineer use block electronic circuitry often designed separately adder multiplexer counter register ALUs etc
Some kind often used describe decoding sequencing instruction ISA using physical microarchitecture
There two basic way build implement description although many design use middle way compromise Some design use combination hardwired design microcode control unit
Some CPU design use compile instruction set writable inside CPU processor FPGA
An ISA also software
Naturally due interpretation overhead slower directly running program emulated hardware unless hardware running emulator order magnitude faster
Today common practice vendor new ISAs microarchitectures make software emulator available software developer hardware implementation ready
Often detail implementation strong influence particular instruction selected instruction set
For example many implementation allow single memory load memory store per instruction leading RISC
For another example early way implementing led
The demand digital signal processing pushed opposite instruction implemented particular way
For example perform digital filter fast enough MAC instruction typical DSP must use kind fetch instruction two data word simultaneously requires
In early computer memory expensive minimizing size program make sure would fit limited memory often central
Thus combined size instruction needed perform particular task important characteristic instruction set
Computers high code density often complex instruction procedure entry parameterized return loop etc
therefore retroactively named
However typical frequent CISC instruction merely combine basic ALU operation add access one operand memory using direct indirect indexed etc
Certain architecture may allow two three operand including result directly memory may able perform function automatic pointer increment etc
instruction set may even complex powerful instruction
first widely implemented period rapidly growing memory subsystem
They sacrifice code density simplify implementation circuitry try increase performance via higher clock frequency register
A single RISC instruction typically performs single operation add register load memory location register
A RISC instruction set normally fixed whereas typical CISC instruction set instruction widely varying length
However RISC computer normally require often longer instruction implement given task inherently make le optimal use bus bandwidth cache memory
Certain embedded RISC ISAs like typically exhibit high density owing technique called code compression
This technique pack two instruction one instruction unpacked decode stage executed two instruction
MISC form separate instruction multiple instruction fit single machine word
These type core often take little silicon implement easily realized form
The code density MISC similar code density RISC increased instruction density offset requiring primitive instruction task
There research mechanism improving code density
The mathematics describes challenge limit
Instruction set may categorized maximum number operand specified instruction
In example follow direct calculated address referring memory cell refer machine register
Due large number bit needed encode three register instruction RISC architecture instruction invariably design Atmel AVR version
RISC architecture instruction usually design architecture
Each instruction specifies number operand register memory location immediate value
Some instruction give one operand implicitly stored top implicit register
If operand given implicitly fewer operand need specified instruction
When destination operand explicitly specifies destination additional operand must supplied
Consequently number operand encoded instruction may differ mathematically necessary number argument logical arithmetic operation
Operands either encoded opcode representation instruction else given value address following instruction
measure availability free register point time program execution
Register pressure high large number available register use thus higher register pressure often register content must memory
Increasing number register architecture decrease register pressure increase cost
While embedded instruction set suffer extremely high register pressure small register set RISC ISAs like enjoy low register pressure
CISC ISAs like offer low register pressure despite smaller register set
This due many addressing mode optimization addressing memory operand ALU instruction absolute addressing addressing spill CISC ISAs offer

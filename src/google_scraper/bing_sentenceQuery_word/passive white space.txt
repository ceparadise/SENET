Space important layout
Space created content text image list logo etc created space content called negative space whitespace
Space passive layout process
Or active reason guide user eye help make decision
Shapes element communicate idea example BP logo
Unusual shape attract attention whilst conventional shape combined colour convey meaning
Take red triangle example
From computer software road traffic sign red triangle mean warning
Something wrong
Whereas green circle mean everything good
Proceed
In classical design three type shape geometric natural abstract
Geometric shape expect circle square triangle rectangle diamond
Natural shape derived see around u
Abstract shape representative impressionistic expressionistic
Like art movement impressionistic abstract shape meant represent something else
Expressionistic shape convey meaning emotion
Shape size two basic element graphic design determine space
If I change shape something I changing space around
If I increase size shape I decrease space around
Now quite abstract moment
How apply theory every day work
How knowing difference abstract geometric shape make difference
Well learning look
Throughout art school design school lecturer professor would encourage view thing differently
To simplify environment shape
To look space thing
To appreciation shape size tone
By looking world way start understand richness complexity design around u
Typographic colour refers density type page either physical page screen
The shade typographic colour impact legibility dark typographic hierarchy content difficult read
Too light shade typographic colour content also diffcult read reader finding hard read line line
But plenty make thing easier reader
Let look example dark typographic colour The first paragraph set Helvetica
Clearly leading line height set small
The second paragraph us correct leading italic serif typeface generally letterforms set closely together
To correct two paragraph need add leading first add last
But remember add much
Type designer carefully crafted distance letterforms
To disrupt distance tamper feel typeface disastrous consequence
Now let look example light typographic colour Using typeface example show setting paragraph much leading much letter spacing also result uncomfortable reading experience
Typefaces also bearing typographic colour
Some typeface wide open counter large space letterforms called kern
Whilst others tight counter minimal open space letterforms
Even choice typeface play significant role typographic colour final design
My first design job based small studio Manchester city centre UK
It mostly print design agency produced work various large small client alike varying medium packaging publication marketing support material etc
One avenue output studio direct mail
Designing Direct Mail actually quite tricky one simple reason go fairly sophisticated graphic design principle standard fare college
Instead designing direct mail sophisticated small lump concrete
Direct mail client want appear market getting away fact work well big bold brash design order day
And word one client word I never forget long I practicing graphic designer white space empty space
However part truth
Definition white negative space space element composition web page web app spread magazine
Actually part truth
The space major element composition micro white space
Micro white space yes guessed white space element list item space caption image space word letter
A ago I lucky enough go see Erik Spiekermann give lecture
Part talk redesign The Economist magazine
He mentioned one primary reason redesign Economist thought design heavy
The content difficult read
In newspaper design many parallel web design information dense
Sometimes web design difficult add white space content make hard
Newspapers often deal using typeface body quite light plenty white space within around character
This part Erik solution redesign Economist
He redesigned typeface slightly whilst retaining quirkiness original
He added whitespace individual character
He set type slightly smaller I believe leading
All adding micro white space design
The overall result subtle
The content legible overall feeling magazine lighter yet still amount content
I learnt Erik day order achieve lightness increase legibility design especially applies web look design macro level
Looking space tiny stuff micro level big impact effectiveness design
For year designer using White Space design create feeling sophistication upscale brand
This Direct Mail client actually correct view white space product adding white space design would position product upscale
Coupled sensitive use typography photography careful use White Space seen certain brand market align competitor
Take cosmetic example fact luxury good use white space marketing material tell reader sophisticated high quality generally expensive
The opposite said Direct Mail get letterbox Red white black bold typography little white space
The result impression
The content design element photography
The design element differ however create two design opposite end brand spectrum
Of course simplified view world lot go brand recognition simply White Space
But I trying get brief land desk luxury brand I bet client audience product expects white space marketing material plenty align competitor
White Space often used create balanced harmonious layout
One feel right
It also used take reader journey design
In way photographer leaf looking room portrait shot positioning subject
centre frame looking remaining space designer increase effectiveness design
Another way looking white space reader user reacts
White space used designer create harmony balance design help position brand used lead reader one element another
This called Active White Space
Let take following example active white space applied
So everything pretty cramped
We need add white space create harmony visual comfort design
Here I adding margin changing type family weight also adding leading also known
The white space added passive white space
There theory passive white space white space present within composition unconsidered
I disagree bad design
Passive white space still important job create breathing room balance
Now within content something I want reader see second quote
I could highlight different colour make type size larger
I could time
In instance however I added white space around element draw user eye addition reducing white space type tracking actually making type bold
This active white space
White space added composition better emphasise structure information
Sometimes way get grip concept arbitrary subjective white space practice
In way martial artist spend hour upon hour drilling simple technique graphic designer
For many designer part craft forgotten leave high school replaced class lateral thinking design history
Working pressure real client demanding real work leaf little room time needed design drill
If find spare hour two though I great place start
Graphic design student conducted type compositional exercise decade luckily u design legend past year documented process
One favourite Emil Ruder
Emil Ruder Swiss typographer died
After year teaching typography produced book called Typography A Design Manual ISBN
The book deliberately restricted pure typography working prefabricated type subordinated precise system measurement
Its purpose make apparent law typography spite certain common feature contrast graphic design selection mean application freer So sense Ruder teaching fairly black white
There focus typography subtlety designing letterforms
Ruder take right wrong great place start learning fundamental principle
There great exercise covering white space also compositional device
It drill
It expensive I urge buy book follow example
White Space space thing space left
Knowing design manipulate space outside around content give reader head start product right market positioning perhaps make see content new light
Gosh
I never thought white space useful
I always tend fill whole picture whatever I insert wipe space

Thanks focusing importance white space relates typography
A lot advice I seen concentrated space section web design
While I always fan minimal approach design I started addressing typographical issue I got kind result really pleased
One thing I noticed often minimal site better overall use white space le accessible site term font size legibility
Smaller font size work best purely aesthetic level minimal design larger font sometimes look place
It question I pondering related site specifically think case widely

We want show tool vital may amaze designer
It underrated silence musical note
However powerful enough mean keeping people page survival word
Many element form layout structure interactive design
Often neglected one vital negative space space found inside surrounding design element
For website app many different visual element make layout
These include drawn line icon image etc
Imagine painting part painted bit
However need form painting
They need canvas
White space like canvas background hold element together design enabling stand
Let see designing white space important
White space area design element
It also space design element including space typography glyph readable character
Despite name white space need white
It texture pattern even background image
White space cause problem designer client
Design theory promotes use white space elegance ensuring quality user experience
Sadly many client manager consider white space wasted space
They think could used house information visual element
On contrary white space great tool balance design element better organize content improve visual communication experience
If technical writer charge composing hundred manual kitchen appliance company would work find superb balance word image
Few people read manual pleasure crucial hold reader attention
For white space real star show working word picture
It keep page looking busy
Instead calling helpline reader digest troubleshooting advice
People get frustrated information bombard
We human machine
White space calm u letting u breathe
As user interface element designer need understand role white space play experiment find right balance rest element
White space commonly categorized based density micro white space relationship macro white space
We talking ratio proportion
We call small space design element white space
You find line paragraph
It includes space grid image used separate menu link
Micro white space direct impact content legibility
For example marginal white space surrounding paragraph affect user reading speed comprehension
If text appears margin outside regular paragraph people read slowly
They find harder understand text without margin
Macro white space large space major layout element space surrounding design layout
You find white space right left website content space website content block
Unlike micro white space macro white space act container overall design
It big picture white space easier notice
Probably best example website implement macro white space intensively effectively homepage
Google iconic look beautifully simple notice something else
That also
Because clutter le work eye mind
You focus reason search something
There great story behind Google ended way
one first website make extensive use white space
When started Internet connection far slower
Participants user test would wait page download despite everything already screen
They used seeing much white space
From user test designer Google decided add copyright notice bottom page user know page fully loaded
The use macro micro space depends following factor With information layout fewer amount macro white space available
In volume micro white space increase
This compromise vital otherwise page would solid chunk data extremely difficult read
For example Boulton describes news website tend depend micro white space provide effective legible experience user
Users reading comfort crucial
The user interface design influence ratio micro macro white space layout
The designer chooses design style
This bias layout one type white space another
including demographic information used determine right balance macro micro white space specific audience
There rule thumb apply consistently audience
As always user experience need check target user product service
Using white space suggest company budget thus quality product
Think branding company Apple Mercedes Benz IKEA
How support theory
The image show macro micro white space old page BBC news website
Mirroring paper newspaper news website tend make scarce use white space
Instead show high quantity content page
They reflect happening world
Besides differentiation white space also look white space
white space used enhance help guide user page content
applied improve layout without guiding user specific reading flow content order
For example white space font glyph paragraph line function way Boulton
The image show difference text white space applied passive white space applied well passive active white space applied As saw micro white space essential making interface content legible
As designer consider white space choosing design typography specification font size color style leading kerning tracking
Remember image previous page
Changing white space layout affect reading performance overall user experience
Happy reader far likely stay page
White space contributes tone overall design
Websites larger amount macro white space may reflect minimalism luxury
Websites smaller amount macro white space may come across informative case news website Kyrnin
Note indication set stone
It always best use white space user
Only tell perceive design
White space help guide user interactive content
It may help build focal point direct user attention specific layout part
Part strategic planning website giving priority specific element content
You use many visual method spotlight specific element one play amount white space around focal point
The branding print industry apply theory draw attention brand message
White space negative space area design element
It another tool designer design user experience UX
Remember white space necessarily white name indicate space neither user interface UI element specific content
As designer introduce white space based four main factor Use organize content layout direct user block content shown
Use design element feature seen text image content block
We also approach white space
Passive white space specific role design facilitating user experience
It easier read
Active white space guide focus attention user
It standing making statement

Let say library
It nice move around overcrowded shelf hall librarian continuously prompting latest book arrived
It white space used web design give room breathe many website element
White space extremely important web design usability readability emphasizes particular element
Imagine would many word stuck together
User experience would definitely unpleasant would take lot effort understand message website
White space also known negative space refers empty space around several element design page layout
It also known breathing room
And white
Actually color would fit long creates clean nice design
Even negative space contain anything define enhance positive space
Negative space considered passive element play extremely important role enhancing brand exposure improving entire visual layout
Creating delivering great user experience involves using white space deny huge importance element
It guide user page creates sophistication harmonious layout communicates need attention website facilitates scannability
White space used several element sidebar text footer header image
A cluttered page especially hierarchy within text worsens reading speed comprehension
Negative space become valuable content
This applies especially important brand add note elegance
There two type white space micro macro white space
Micro white space space smaller element letter word list item image caption
Think example online newspaper
It need space around character paragraph order make content easy read give newspaper clean light feeling
Macro space mean space larger element used Google website example
It clean design focus main purpose page aspect emphasized
To test website building look like term color Adobe Kuler right tool
You create edit upload various color scheme
Plus doubt know font would appropriate try Google Webfonts
Select different font see interwine white space
If sure use whitespace building customizing site Balsamiq helpful
It help work faster easier reproducing sketch whiteboard computer
As website web form
It extremely important place use negative space context
And creating web form usually involves coding need tool simplify work save time
web form builder requires coding ideal also use white space build web form
White space active passive
Active negative space lead reader one element another creates harmony position brand much better
Passive whitespace actually white space surrounding outside page blank area inside content sometimes regarded poor design
Negative space creates balance good overall flow influence reader making stay page
And applies online newspaper website
Sometimes web designer faced various platform screen resolution browser
That compositional exercise web design student
These exercise help realize importance negative space use effectively
White space give brain visual cue regarding element separated belong together
The best example consists several line phone number email address site separated white space signal brain different sequence long number
If white space website look classy
This use negative space common expensive classy magazine woman
Almost ad feature lot white space enough room background photo text scarce
An opposite example direct email ad got least
Remember little negative space combined many big block text look well
So huge influence
That web designer work mind creating customizing particular site
There basic principle create good web page design
Negative space separate element header footer navigation
And next time design page analyze margin padding instead wondering much space need text
If doubt client understand quite well importance negative space build design two different way
One featuring le negative space convey practical tone one white space sophisticated feeling
Keep mind use element two design
The thing differently change spacing element
Perhaps best way see white space used learn importance take look several website
They inspire help future project
Just take look following website free imagination result excellent
us white space create clean minimalist look
This way emphasis website category link
keep simple us plenty white space add touch style personality
example white space white light blue
There also colored geometric element enhance certain category
feature lot white space
The purpose catch eye enhance image category featured webpage
us white space wisely
It emphasizes category logo
In centre page several colored section lead important piece information
While scrolling notice whitespace still dominates focus still section
also website us white space add sophistication elegance
At time negative space used better showcase product
sleek design
The focus product USP website category
included white space order create emotion increase user engagement
combine white space colored white space drive attention key point website
Simple effective
website touch elegance sophistication due white space
Negative space used enhance main category
feature simple white layout keep visitor interested
Everything easy read due clean design
website grab attention almost instantly
It amazing negative space alternate image video call action
Just take look
website predominance white space separate multiple element
The overall impression clean beautiful easy read page
take advantage negative space using around image column action order showcase various part website contact detail
another great example whitespace used web design
As see guide eye contributes nice airy design
This way website category beautifully displayed
great example white space white
It creates harmony balance make website look uncluttered highlight content
also demonstrates effectiveness colored negative space
Here bold color highlight message social medium button contact field site category
feature white space actually light grey hue combined large graphic display product well possible
advocate negative space
This website demonstrates le
And achieved keeping element really important
White space increase readability usability making everything website extremely easy read understand
lot white space combined colorful element
This make page extremely easy navigate
Additionally interacting website pleasant experience
Each category noticeable without making design cluttered
These website make good use white space
Although white space controversial element find multiple site using due benefit
If used negative space contributes great user experience
White space often cause friction web designer client
Sometimes client want see empty space website thinking must covered content
That designer explain client role negative space
It may difficult least beginner articulate influence
Nonetheless think white space empty space without meaning
Yes may look empty ordinary remember used especially really improves overall design something else add
It difficult explain client I hope article help

Archived You About month ago I posted
The post explained difference passive active space offered reason active space important well create active space design
What post lacked real world example using active space
This post aim correct failing
As commented earlier post said I understand love concept abstract level
Could add example
I agreed example would helpful thus post
Hopefully find example along thought I think space activated helpful understanding topic
You click example image taken site logo shown
There consistency talking active space
Though I specifically mention every design activate space planning space
The space happen design
The designer consciously considered space much considered positive form
In design create unequal uneven space help make interesting active
Space like form seen shape molded
The space much form integral design space influence perception positive element
You also notice design feature start
The image article using A List Apart
The site us design create interesting shape
Notice graphic right article
It lack border uneven shape generates equally interesting shape space around
Above home page Cameron Moll site
Again note asymmetrical design
Ample space exists move positive element
A texture placed upper left activating space area design
One small detail I particularly like space around link top sidebar
Note curved shape
The link could listed order clearly shape space around make consideration link ordered
The recent post Elliot Jay Stocks
Once asymmetrical design ample space allow eye flow space around element page
Again subdued texture helping make space interesting
Notice image top article break content area space left lead u next section design
Andy Rutledge often activates space article simple pull quote
The quote encroaches space carves thus activating
Notice much interesting entire article left hard edge
Similar article Jason Santa Maria
The heading content carves space left usually left empty
While shown image comment post also carve space placing usual biographical information commenter
The screenshot another article using whitespace time Mark Boulton Think Vitamin site
As design section notice image within article carve space left horizontal black line top article
Throughout design positive element space around creates many interesting shape within design
This article Trent Walton site continue exploration letting positive element carve surrounding space
The page heading also form interesting shape creating interesting space around
Note meta information post move even space carved page heading logo
Not orange bar reach surrounding space leading page pull space see design
It also divide space left half forcing eye move space around center page
The space around design active channel eye move
On Veerle Pieters home page us illustration upper right
The illustration carves space also reach space outside design activating
Resting arm main content area give solid feeling
This article Jason Santa Maria also us illustration carve space
The illustration reach outside design left comment section connecting article
The illustration also lead interesting shape around article
Pocket Hercules home page
Space appears actively forcing positive form edge much company logo sits partly page
Most design empty space get filled little little click link menu
Similar design Jacey Braband home page
Again space influencing element forcing edge
If click site click link see space right navigation used little differently page
Many create interesting space shape within area
Once logo menu forced edge Julie Roche home page design
The banner right hanging space implies force space play
As Jacey Braband site click click link discover space holding banner used differently different page way shaping activating space
The overall layout Taylor Carrigan home page symmetrical
We could easily draw box around centered layout
However space activated wonderful way scale graphic navigation
The scale creates depth space implies motion toward away viewer eye
You look design without feeling depth space
The design Jason Santa Maria site use positive shape enclose space
Above cable graphic create interest shape enclosing space within
Notice also carve space page
Parenthesis generally used enclose something
Here enclose space forcing look space consider space important
If read post long good read see connection post era time enclose something may one day disappear
Above single page
It simply string text letter missing word pushed together
The missing letter make use closure
We reader need actively think missing space order read sentence
We also need add back space order see separate word
Without use space reading ordinary sentence
Ho hum yawn
We time
Here though space make u active part design
The large amount empty space outside simple statement lends importance
Again important part activating space design space planned considered
The space happen result positive element placed page
In every case designer shaped space much shaped positive form page
Similar different technique used across design ultimately designer designing space much form
Let look logo activate space incorporating space directly logo
In negative space help communicate brand
I sure seen first two logo
The four made way onto list logo using negative space
The FedEx logo activates space E x shaping arrow
The space clearly planned integral logo
It implies directional motion much like package shipped one location another
The BigTen logo creates number space show conference currently member
Again space integral logo communicates extra member I believe Penn State conference added
I also assume logo need change Nebraska joining conference member later year
I really like logo Jacob Cass
Again space integral understanding design
The space carved prong fork food shape bottle wine
Even without text easy see logo represents
Note asymmetry making surrounding space interesting
The logo Fish sushi restaurant I believe definitely borrows
Escher half fish seen positive space half seen negative space
As logo space planned integral design activated result
In logo yoga australia Roy Smith us space enclosed woman yoga pose form shape Australia
Again planned result active
The woman also asymmetrically activating space around
The logo Matin Newcombe property maintenance company
Not space inside wrench shape simple house positive form wrench act negative space house much way company would provide service work home
In key activating space used way integral logo
None logo would communicate without purposely shaping space
White space regarded active element passive background
I included quote previous post activating space
I include important aspect regard making space active
The first step creating active space actively think space
See another design element disposal
I hope help make abstract concept previous post understandable
There many many example active passive space design print online
As exercise come across design like even one think space decide think space active
I leave article talk space design
book Design Fundamentals
Those excellent example design active space
I send link designer reference
A nice article good point though favourite negative space logo Spartan Golf Club logo excellent example using considered blank space
That nice logo
I like motion swing implied
Really love kind design
If I right called minimalist
Thanks sharing
They really good inspiring

Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In general testing finding well something work
In term human being testing tell level knowledge skill acquired
In computer hardware software development testing used key checkpoint overall process determine whether objective met
For example software development product objective sometimes tested product user representative
When design complete coding follows finished code tested unit module level programmer component level group programmer involved system level component combined together
At early late stage product service may also tested
The IoT world may exciting serious technical challenge need addressed especially developer

Are MVP MMF related different
There lot disagreement confusion practical interpretation term
I would get hung long Product Owner stakeholder development team agree working definition organization
Minimum Viable Product term frequently attributed
The succinct definition I seen MVP definition minimum viable product version new product allows team collect maximum amount validated learning customer least effort
In word smallest collection marketable feature roll
An MMF Mark Denne Jane smallest unit functionality intrinsic marketable value
This begs question mean given context make clear term generally applied rather product whole
Having defined MMF MVP I understand difference MVP collection one MMFs
In turn MMF smallest possible increment real potential value customer
They really different term thing smallest shippable iteration piece software
One could argue MMF best used talking new feature existing product MVP new product might require several feature MMF
That bit pedantic though
I quite like BVI Business Value Increment alternative I think Chris Matts coined one
It contain word minimum bad connotation folk outside IT world ambiguous enough cover enhancement new use increment make clearer intend continue improving launch provided make sense
Here good definition explanation difference The minimum viable product MVP powerful concept allows test idea
It confused minimal marketable product MMP product smallest feature set still address user need creates right user experience
The MVP help acquire relevant knowledge address key risk MMP reduces enables launch product faster Minimum viable product
It smallest thing get hypothesis
That
It even piece software
Oftentimes well formed question storyboard suffice
The point created marketable created used answer question
Minimum Marketable feature something tangible value customer
It something someone use accomplish something

A product enough feature satisfy early customer provide feedback future
Some expert suggest business business transaction MVP also mean saleable MVP sell
Viable mean sell
Gathering insight MVP often le expensive developing product feature increase cost risk product fails example due incorrect assumption
The term coined defined Frank Robinson popularized
It may also involve carrying market analysis beforehand
A minimum viable product core feature sufficient deploy product
Developers typically deploy product subset possible thought forgiving likely give feedback able grasp product vision early prototype marketing information
This strategy target avoiding building product customer want seek maximize information customer per dollar
The definition use word maximum minimum mean decidedly formulaic
It requires judgement figure given context MVP make sense
An MVP part strategy process directed toward making selling product customer
It core artifact iterative process idea generation prototyping presentation data collection analysis learning
One seek minimize total time spent iteration
The process iterated desirable obtained product deemed
typically refers minimum viable product minimum feature set
Releasing assessing impact minimum viable product market testing strategy used screen product idea soon generation
The release facilitated tool language common development
The MVP differs conventional market testing strategy investing time money early implement product testing market
The MVP intended ensure market large time monetary investment made
The MVP differs open source methodology listens user letting define feature future product
The MVP start product vision maintained throughout product life cycle although adapted based explicit implicit indirect measure feedback potential future customer product
The MVP strategy may used part Blank methodology focus continual product iteration refinement based customer feedback
Additionally presentation product feature may refined using
The general method akin program code testing methodology called unit test written fail code written
The used map major component activity company starting
The minimum viable product designed using selected component Business Model Canvas Concepts minimum viable product applied aspect startup organization
Using Minimum Viable Brand MVB concept ensure brand hypothesis grounded strategic intent market insight
Finding people create minimum viable product common challenge new company startup
The concept minimum viable based looking following attribute Founders company faced challenge building team minimal people cost
The process start listing basic function particular company engineer operation finance stripping abstract job activity skill company must operate

A minimum viable product MVP development technique new product website developed sufficient feature satisfy early adopter
The final complete set feature designed developed considering feedback product initial user
This concept popularized Eric Ries consultant writer startup
A minimum viable product MVP pared version product still released
An MVP three key characteristic The catch development technique assumes early adopter see vision promise final product provide valuable feedback needed guide developer forward
This suggests technically orientated product used technical user may appropriate type development technique

Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position
Or I even bother Master CS since I already industry certification
said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

Dennis said hello I Dennis
I year old I believe I want career computer science
But I never well school I visual kind guy
Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers
tom said Hello everybody
The name Tom I actually getting ready throw CS degree Now majority high school year spent totally ignoring class filling lung MJ booze learning love take care apartment let alone Trust tell I probably worst candidate succeed field thats actually probably true fact
I terrible math I actually process making within month span school start also spending hour day learning code multiple resource online offer structured Java Ruby Python course work progress
I know much current hiring trend related industry internet decides throw know truly believe something waste time business worth totally right

The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get
business belt
Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year
Random Awesomeness said discourage people KIDS especially woman want computer please give reason people computer science
Wolfee GameZ said Yea boi game design would good choice knowing code knowing language
Would also help look animation easier opinion
Those two major thing used game
yeye John Doe said Hey everyone Thanks comment really helped
I college student getting basic way
I always loved computer I pretty good user level
I know HTML access command stuff I never formal education tried learn another coding language I never failed math generally making Bs As strongest subject
Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength
Which sadly would something involving law politics entertainment I really WANT get
Any advice appreciated thank much

The number college student pursuing computer science degree university rose first time six year according released study
Academia policymakers hailing news question facing CIOs others charge IT hiring How much Do company need employee deep technical skill developed computer science software engineering degree better business major
Not surprisingly computer science educator software company hardware manufacturer adamant need computer science major drive innovation tech company
The dearth computer science graduate forcing company look offshore qualified people argue
Not enough computer science major serious repercussion competitiveness say Professor Cary Laxer head computer science software engineering Institute Technology
There large number Chinese student Indian student interested work
We going lose competitive edge country turn software engineer
But CIOs IT staffing firm say need collaboration problem solving communication developed motivated college student
After today Millennials wireless social medium technology integrated lifestyle grasp exploit far better boss
Computer science degree mattered lot year ago IT cost center
But job IT The huge IT budget even CIOs line business say David Foote CEO Foote Partners conduct quarterly survey IT skill pay
This brought whole new group IT skill come mathematics economics business marketing
On March The Computing Research Association issued annual report number college student pursuing computer science bachelor degree university
The number shown sharp decline throughout decade
In fall around newly declared computer science major
That figure dropped half bust bottoming last two year
But increase
See
Having enough computer science software engineering major critical tech company say need hire undergraduate deep technical skill practical programming experience
For software engineering role tend look people strong computer science background experience programming say Yvonne Agyei director Talent Outreach Programs Google People Operations Department
We need core programming skill algorithm skill quantitative analysis
We looking people majored computer science engineering sometimes math physic
Agyei say hire computer savvy business major department software engineering
In addition software engineering role role within business within legal within finance facility technology passion technology important Agyei say
It help familiarity product
Having knowledge really important regardless aspect business go
Even year rise computer science major tech company say still enough computer scientist engineer fill open job
That tech company CIOs often hire instead
In responded drop computer science degree creating provides free software training tool college professor across discipline rather computer science department
IBM working college faculty worldwide around student
As company greater greater need computer communication software decline student going consequence supply demand balance say Kevin Faughnan director IBM Academic Initiative
IBM goal Academic Initiative encourage college student become familiar IT apply across industry
With initiative IBM focusing strengthening technical underpinning business major rather encouraging computer science major
The business student computer science skill intro data management Web part major Faughnan say
We try encourage faculty interdisciplinary
As part initiative IBM provided university simulation game teach business process modeling It incumbent business school integrate technology curriculum Faughnan say
I think technology much computer science major horizontal skill applied across discipline
For example ca marketing day without data mining
CIOs say hiring business major IT experience computer science major
Henry Eckstein senior vice president strategy technology York Insurance Services Group say member IT shop computer science software engineering degree
Most employee Russia
Eckstein say making hiring decision weighs experience first IT certification second college degree third
If I look candidate I see computer science major going influence decision I looking newer least I know good training discipline Eckstein say
But going someone computer science degree
Particularly I looking developer I looking skill set many year experience knowledge subject matter
When CIOs surveyed top skill looking employee cite technical skill
Instead top concern ethic critical thinking collaboration communication skill according CIO survey compiled
The technical skill demand programming database system analysis ranked lower CIOs priority list
You computer science degree get entry level job IT say Professor Jerry Luftman executive director School Technology Management Stevens Institute Technology
Luftman compiles SIM annual CIO survey
When CIOs asked skill looking people clear skill critical
Luftman say computer science major engineer make good IT professional critical thinking skill logical analysis
But say business information system major valuable employee balance technical skill business collaboration communication skill
During downturn IT asked work business partner identify opportunity leverage IT improve process improve productivity Luftman say
My advice Generation X Generation make sure good balance technical business skill
Stephen Pickett past president SIM auto industry CIO say lack computer science major problem CIOs
That SIM local chapter working business school improve technical offering computer science school improve business course
We necessarily need computer science graduate
A business graduate strong computer science curriculum work lot case Pickett say
In computer science school try add business curriculum get student coming
Pickett say MIS degree good match IT business skill
It enough add computer hobbyist
The thing need project management experience business process evaluation
You get knowing application desktop Pickett add
College grad look business process find improve people going popular
Striking right balance technical skill business knowledge critical given global economic meltdown Pickett say
In downturn even important get people solve business problem business problem much difficult solve Pickett say
You solve problem without significant business resource
You technical knowledge business knowledge lot imagination
Foote say counsel high school student think carefully business like work
The question Do want techie guy work bowel organization work infrastructure job want front working application
Foote say
If want front might want work HR finance whatever area business interest
You also want look industry casino insurance whatever figure product service interested
Foote recommends student majoring math business pursue minor computer science
That give much view IT give option say
Computer science educator claim image old fashioned way viewing program
There perception propagated medium computer science major mean work bowel organization coding front terminal eating potato chip drinking Mountain Dew say Professor Lenny Pitt Director Undergraduate Programs Department Computer Science University Illinois
This far truth
Our graduate working bridge management technical people
They technical writing software testing usability
In light declining enrollment decade top computer science school like University Illinois retooled curriculum embrace soft skill collaboration communication
These department focused graduating student explain complex technical issue layman term
The decline enrollment last six year forced professor think teaching computer science student make sure giving skill need successful like collaborative learning working part team say Peter Harsha director government affair CRA
Carnegie Mellon University emphasizes teamwork collaboration computer science program requires technical communication course
Students also required take course humanity pursue minor field foreign language
Twenty year ago kid would get program would nerdy added requirement program force broader say Professor Peter Lee head Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University
Today opposite problem people tendency dabbler
We want deep broad
Carnegie Mellon strategy seems working
Last year Carnegie Mellon computer science graduate went work industry including IT vendor Microsoft Google IT user Bloomberg Goldman Sachs
The went graduate school
Where see demand high salary people deep technical software skill Lee say
These student computer savvy able manage IT operation
They actually understand software issue engineer software
Those people recruiter want
Lee predicts computer science major remain demand industry becoming dependent computing data mining

Hi I aware question may asked may appropriate I assumed site one knowledgeable topic
I currently enrolled liberal art college BA Computer Science
I dislike slower pace program would like go online college problem one I afford state
The college Maine offer online IT type degree offer Computer Information Systems
So get point I wondering I switch degree think employer would look fact online degree b I would difficulty finding job opportunity CIS degree comparison COS degree
Thanks time IT service provider
Depends goal experience CS job CIS geared job
That said really matter degree online degree
You could history major employer really care
HR want check box focused enough finish degree
Lots people start thing finish
The paper show finish thing
Employers like
Does mean need degree
Not really tech sector
It open door
You eligible job larger company otherwise may qualify wo prevent making decent living
I MIS Management Information Systems degree
Please go Computer Science
Not respected potential employer MIS ambivalent many recruiter
Ultimately though want experience
And based career ambition neither degree may useful
If I I focus getting certification clear area IT want networking IT specialist programmer etc
The way I explain people asked business oriented degree
You find easier get IS degree online CS degree online
Do get wrong plenty program easier find IS program online
One thing easily see two program requirement
IS require general math science per college requirement
Most CS program require Calculus Differential Equations Linear Algebra well Physics
If I went back time I would gotten BS CS gotten way
If going pursue degree get something interest
You resume use demonstrate interested party qualified position degree
It minimum requirement used filter applicant
My impression someone CS lot programming mixed IT skill etc OS Databases networking etc etc
Computer Information system seems le IT backend usage system
My A Level IS little use real world IT experience
It seems touch surface generic le thing work used
My experience Computer Science degree theory
Fundamentals advance topic computer engineering programming Computer much math couple course math major math well
However completely sure Computer Information Systems Bachelor Information Technology learn Business fundamental Organizational Behaviour Programming Development Networking
Then ofcourse work getting certification well IT field decided CCNA
As Bud G put Brand Representative I BS Information Studies basically library science degree programming
I also AS EET transferred year FSU
I loved major I year ahead big data craze
We programming class get major I came machine language COBOL left C java
More importantly I learned alot back think like user design system program etc
It school ask
I paid internship Career Center
I make web page HTML CSS could put access database
employer coming career fair web
The server AIX
I got first job I could web stuff real world experience UNIX
Computer Science study completely different topic Computer Information Systems
Computer Science focus algorithm theory efficiency programming language software design
It heavy advanced mathematics
Computer Information Systems focus much heavily system networking business aspect
Two different degree unfortunately many people especially HR type think difference name
I currently getting IS degree Western Governors University
It online school chosen degree path IT Security I get different cert flat tuition rate
Do much weigh far difference CS IS looking online program want go IS route I would definitely check WGU
Found link might find interesting breakdown CS v IT v IS
I experience area BS CS engineering department MIS minor
At time called MIS rather IS business school
As result I class venue
Although I find working traditional business role IT Director rather engineering role I believe CS class invaluable success
The whole experience learning algorithm think like programmer applies daily work well
I still bit programming time permit even management role knowing estimate programming project tell vendor trying buffalo project cost timeline absolute necessity
I afraid I inherited bit snob attitude CS world towards
I faculty advisor tell COBOL
I guess I take weekend learn someday saw class schedule next semester
He jackass I responded OK take week I think I take semester version
I several year Computer Science state university California others said focused programming math theory etc
Nearly IT related class simply programming Java never got deal practical aspect IT
I really disliked finish program
Currently I BS IT Security emphasis WGU Zac everything I would want
It practical course focus application skill program used aspect IT
As said I echo Computer Science theory programming practical use administration
I tend think CS programming CIS mix programming hardware OS server etc
The school determine degree focus
From recent search anything else IT
The difference online traditional school great used
If school accredited good background fine
Let u know interest steer
I agree RDavid
Get certification addition degree
CS programming career field unto
If want get job write working code save sample
There certification different language
Google
When I looking work year ago online posting wanted knowledge Python Ruby Rails PhP javascript web programming language
This one produce demonstrable body work show potential employer maybe website go try
There also database field would benefit SQL certification
Again produce demonstrable body work
Hardware certification give miraculous ability resurrect broken computer currently used model sitting morgue unknown reason
I liked part best
Then networking OS usage
networking one
Cisco good one
My AS computer science gave broad base I actually use
There also career field
This one I would highly recommend website set start applying
Is somewhere always wanted work
Apply
There reason ca work Apple always wanted
Nothing make attractive company finding honest truth love product actually fantasized working especially love accounting get accounting
Applying work like marrying anyone
Things work better marry wife husband
When I school nothing even remotely close I would call IT major degree computer science programming CIS business use program Electrical Engineering drafting circuitry study electrical theory IT probably closest CIS troubleshooting IT troubleshooting program user said program start generally stuck helpdesk type position begin
Programming really help IT unless actually making tool engineering team never come IT guy asking help code What really need learn IT career networking active directory server operating system know people like stick either Mac Windows Linux real IT professional probably need understand use point
IT problem solving anything else
Thank everyone input I truly appreciate
I wanted add I earlier I understand difference COS CIS
What I really trying figure degree better make look better
My problem I enough exposure know exactly I want IT world although I leaning towards type job
Timothy Myers wrote Thank everyone input I truly appreciate

My question Not one peer professor current college even mentioned yet seem really important
Thank input Western Governors University
It seem like good University lack AS degree many high level IT class I may qualify
Therefore relatively cheap semester
Thank even answer one question much appreciated
In grand scheme thing shouldnt make much difference career prospect interest
Alot job advert I seeing UK moment simply specifying computer orientated degree x classification
I Associates Applied Sciences AAS Computer Technology Support Specialist CTSS would fall CIS degree
I originally started BS Computer Science found cup tea
I enjoyed administration aspect technology found I could program way paper bag
My code terrible barely manged complete assigned task usually crashed server entire college
It much one make look better really want
Do want write code want support administer system
Both equally important HR usually understand difference CS CIS hiring unless manager dictate looking applicant
Certifications help get door bad
Once door may need
Your employer may offer pay maintain obtain
That entirely employer universal
I current certification asked obtain maintain
If I need go job hunting I may pick bolster credential
Granted I got multiple year experience Systems Admin far outweighs piece paper
Paper hurt though
I might look upon online degree bachelor degree
I think college class take
It learning experience time become well rounded
I online class I think place
I would say something technical good candidate online class
IT service provider

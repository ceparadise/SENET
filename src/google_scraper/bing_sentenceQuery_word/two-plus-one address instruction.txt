If I address machine machine likely follow RISC CISC design
address
address
address
To solve problem I first looked different term
When first investigating relationship RISC v CISC machine help I able quickly associate address CISC address RISC
I saw address instruction much complicated address therefore would make sense CISC design
Similar reasoning address machine RISC design
How would make distinguish CISC RISC address size middle
The problem term marketing term science engineering term
The term supposedly acronym Reduced Instruction Set Computing Complex Instruction Set Computing
Your assumption address much complicated address logic typically instruction associated RISC instruction associated CISC instruction common associated either RISC CISC
The term generally associated instruction set following characteristic Fixed width instruction
Usually
This make easier instruction decoder find boundary instruction
In CISC machine contrast different instruction range length much
This make job instruction decoder somewhat harder CISC machine result program consuming le memory
Fewer operand addressing mode
In RISC machine typically one available picture
Typically type instruction available addressing mode
The source operand found register result computation placed register
type instruction typically one operand register direct operand
type instruction typically
There typically also type instruction register indirect target sometimes instruction target operand
compared CISC instruction set
The reasoning trying keep instruction decoder simple possible RISC machine
The simple operand addressing mode easier implement simple pipeline decoder modern CISC machine often extra work instruction complex operand mode sequence like RISC instruction
There tendency RISC architecture register name available
Many RISC architecture register many CISC architecture
This making somewhat simpler exploit parallelism simple pipeline
Having available register name make possible compiler use different register name unrelated computation without requiring hardware register renaming
RISC architecture tend instruction CISC architecture tend mostly instruction
The notion also somewhat fuzzy somewhat
Every instruction operand source operand destination operand
The real distinction whether operand
In instruction make operand explicit
In instruction make destination operand explicit one source operand explicit
The third source operand always address destination operand
In instruction one source operand explicit
The source operand implicitly either accumulator register top stack destination operand
Finally instruction operand implicit usually two source operand top two value stack destination go back top stack
To sum marketing term really mean much
The important concept relationship different design choice choice make easier harder implement hardware pipeline
To understand technical aspect survive WanderingLogic said marketting aspect dominated quite quickly dichotomy need consider four point really dichotomy continuum history important RISC came reaction tentative close called
Do look simple arithmetic done give information look instruction like polynomial evaluation function entry automatic display setting register saving
Those complex instruction absent RISC present CISC
They introduced complication processor function could often implemented rapidly sequence simpler instruction especially needed full generality
RISC somewhat result ISA design trying make cost inclusion instruction justified benefit frequency execution
history important RISC became popular time implementing RISC single chip possible implementing CISC either use several chip space saving technique impact performance
You nearly define RISC answer question get high performance CPU area
When space available chip increased RISC cpu became CISCy
Now get high performance CPU small area
You ca rely cache chip lot register benefit locality data access
Thus accumulator stack architecture
Aspect carried register windowing
Pipelining
That mean overlappable instruction thus operand trouble independent instruction
Simplify decoding
Fixed width instruction
Thus wide enough operand cost implementing operand mostly instruction width get RISC operand ISA
Delayed jump le result pipelining decoding simplified extreme

In single operation defined processor
The size length instruction varies widely little many multiple VLIW system
Most modern processor used instruction size bit
In architecture especially instruction fixed length typically corresponding architecture
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifying operation performed add content memory register zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous operation operand specified single instruction
Instructions rarely specified using form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
There another general definition instruction related processor An instruction may representation element executable

This service advanced JavaScript available learn A computer program instruction address part contains exactly two address address two operand
An example instruction instruction add content two storage location specified two address

In case branch Instructions use addressing
But I really clear said book MIPS address calculating branch target actually relative address following instruction opposed current instruction
Anybody please explain
Thanks
This question came site computer enthusiast power user
Branch instruction MIPS offset value provide offset byte
This offset added Next PC value rather PC branch
Why NPC used rather PC branch obvious
This may related use Stanford MIPS project assembler performed limited instruction reordering filling delayed branch slot previous instruction
With design offset forward branch branch positive offset commonly used implement conditionally branching clause would never changed conversion offset backward branch branch negative offset commonly used loop would changed delay slot filled extra instruction
This might simplify compiler development
An alternative speculation would slightly simplified initial implementation branch evaluated second pipeline stage current PC NPC relative branch instruction
A third speculation considered conceptually cleaner given use delayed branch slot
The offset becomes relative instruction branch activated
As comment say probably easier fit add displacement target increment PC sub step instruction execution one done early
This wo make much difference reach forward somewhat greater backwards might affect corner case
In case I met assembler
implemented long branch equal By posting answer agree

In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

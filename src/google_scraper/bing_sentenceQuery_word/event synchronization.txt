In refers one two distinct related concept synchronization synchronization
refers idea multiple process join certain point order reach agreement commit certain sequence action
refers idea keeping multiple copy dataset coherence one another maintain
Process synchronization primitive commonly used implement data synchronization
The need synchronization arise merely system kind concurrent process even single processor system
Mentioned main need synchronization When job arrives fork point split N serviced n task
After serviced wait done processing
Then joined leave system
Thus parallel programming require synchronization parallel process wait several process occur
In relationship consumer process dependent producer process till necessary data produced
When multiple process dependent resource need access time operating system need ensure one processor access given point reduces concurrency
Thread synchronization defined mechanism ensures two concurrent simultaneously execute particular program segment known
Processes access critical section controlled using synchronization technique
When one thread start executing serialized segment program thread wait first thread finish
If proper synchronization technique applied may cause value variable may unpredictable vary depending timing process thread
For example suppose three process namely
All three concurrently executing need share common resource critical section shown Figure
Synchronization used avoid conflict accessing shared resource
Hence Process try access resource assigned one process time
If assigned Process process Process need wait Process free resource shown Figure
Another synchronization requirement need considered order particular process thread executed
For example board plane buy ticket
Similarly check without validating credential user name password
In way ATM provide service provide correct PIN
Other mutual exclusion synchronization also deal following One challenge exascale algorithm design minimize reduce synchronization
Synchronization take time computation especially distributed computing
Reducing synchronization drew attention computer scientist decade
Whereas becomes increasingly significant problem recently gap improvement computing latency increase
Experiments shown global communication due synchronization distributed computer take dominated share sparse iterative solver
This problem receiving increasing attention emergence new benchmark metric High Performance Conjugate Gradient HPCG ranking top supercomputer
The following classic problem synchronization These problem used test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme primitive
Many system provide hardware support code
A single processor could disable executing currently running code without inefficient system
The key ability require implement synchronization multiprocessor set hardware primitive ability atomically read modify memory location
Without capability cost building basic synchronization primitive high increase processor count increase
There number alternative formulation basic hardware primitive provide ability atomically read modify location together way tell read write performed atomically
These hardware primitive basic building block used build wide variety synchronization operation including thing
In general architect expect user employ basic hardware primitive instead expect primitive used system programmer build synchronization library process often complex tricky
Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instruction either memory word content two memory word
In prevent thread interference memory consistency error block code wrapped section
This force thread acquire said lock object execute block
The lock automatically released thread leaf block enter waiting state within block
Any variable update made thread synchronized block become visible thread whenever thread similarly acquires lock
In addition mutual exclusion memory consistency Java block enable signaling sending event thread acquired lock execute code block waiting lock within block
This mean Java synchronized section combine functionality mutexes event
Such primitive known
Any object fine used Java
The declaring object implicitly implied lock object whole method marked
The synchronization primitive
Synchronization designed cooperative demanding every thread process follow synchronization mechanism accessing protected resource critical section consistent result
In locking signaling lightweight synchronization type spinwait interlocked operation mechanism related synchronization
Another effective way implementing synchronization using spinlocks
Before accessing shared resource piece code every processor check flag
If flag reset processor set flag continues executing thread
But flag set locked thread would keep spinning loop keep checking flag set
But spinlocks effective flag reset lower cycle otherwise lead performance issue waste many processor cycle waiting
Barriers simple implement provide good responsiveness
They based concept implementing wait cycle provide synchronization
Consider three thread running simultaneously starting barrier
After time reach barrier still wait thread reach correct data
Once thread reach barrier start
After time thread reach wait thread correct data
Thus barrier synchronization multiple thread always thread end waiting thread example thread keep waiting thread
This result severe degradation process performance
The barrier synchronization wait function thread represented Wbarrier f Tbarrier Rthread Where Wbarrier wait time thread Tbarrier number thread arrived Rthread arrival rate thread
Experiments show total execution time spent waiting slower thread
Semaphores signalling mechanism allow one access section
A Semaphore flag certain fixed value associated time thread wish access section decrement flag
Similarly thread leaf section flag incremented
If flag zero thread access section get blocked chooses wait
Some semaphore would allow one thread process code section
Such Semaphores called binary semaphore similar Mutex
Here value semaphore thread allowed access value access denied
Synchronization originally concept whereby lock could obtained object
Its primary usage database
There two type file
lock may obtained many process thread
lock exclusive may used single time
Although lock derived file database data also shared memory process thread
Sometimes one object file locked time
If locked simultaneously overlap causing deadlock exception
exclusive lock thread based rely processor instruction
An abstract mathematical foundation synchronization primitive given
There also many theoretical device built top history monoid
Following synchronization example respect different platform
provides provides Enabling disabling kernel preemption replaced spinlocks uniprocessor system
Prior kernel version disabled interrupt implement short critical section
Since version later Linux fully preemptive
provides provides A distinctly different related concept
This refers need keep multiple copy set data coherent one another maintain Figure
For example database replication used keep multiple copy data synchronized database server store data different location
Examples include Some challenge user may face data synchronization When start something data usually simple format
It varies time organization grows evolves result building simple interface two application source target also need transform data passing target application
extraction transformation loading tool helpful stage managing data format complexity
This era system
Customers want see current status order current status parcel real time parcel current balance account etc
This show need system updated well enable smooth manufacturing process ordering material enterprise running stock synchronizing customer order manufacturing process etc
From real life exist many example processing give successful competitive advantage
There fixed rule policy enforce data security
It may vary depending system using
Even though security maintained correctly source system capture data security information access privilege must enforced target system well prevent potential misuse information
This serious issue particularly come handling secret confidential personal information
So sensitivity confidentiality data transfer information must encrypted
Data quality another serious constraint
For better management maintain good quality data common practice store data one location share different people different system application different location
It help preventing inconsistency data
There five different phase involved data synchronization process Each step critical
In case large amount data synchronization process need carefully planned executed avoid negative impact performance

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I benn wondering following possibility I multiple hardware thread core someone decides use shared register allow fast synchronization among thread run CPU implement register instead main memory
Will work
work
Synchronization based requires shared data storage location involved thread read modify
Your shared register shared data storage location
The reason synchronizing register thread running different CPUs register would shared visible one thread
You think register memory location feature removed make faster
In fact something similar scenario possible SPARC processor
The SPARC large register file something like register register always visible register window rest register file
Usually window used implement fast stack frame several experimental runtime system used window support multiple thread

Synchronization context process involves coordinating execution multiple thread ensure desired outcome without corrupting shared data preventing occurrence deadlock race condition
Synchronization also occurs network node ensure data stream received transmitted correctly prevent data collision
It usually us clock signal transmitted sequence data stream maintain proper signal timing
There two type synchronization data synchronization process synchronization Synchronization form basis execution multiple thread asynchronously multithreaded application
It provides mean achieve sharing resource file handling network connection memory coordinating thread process avoid data corruption
The term used context multithreaded application resource shared across multiple thread controlled otherwise lead unpredictable undesirable outcome
The framework provides synchronization primitive using application controlled without race condition
Synchronization designed cooperative demanding every thread follow synchronization mechanism accessing protected resource consistent result

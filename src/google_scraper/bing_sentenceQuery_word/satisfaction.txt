Faculty member physical science greatest rate job satisfaction among untenured assistant professor research university according study released Monday
In study researcher Harvard Graduate School Education surveyed faculty member satisfaction aspect work life
The researcher ranked result broad disciplinary area individual field
The physical science ranked among top three academic discipline approximately half survey aspect among bottom three six
The aspect surveyed included tenure clarity expectation compensation benefit nature teaching research balancing work life job climate culture global satisfaction
The humanity followed physical science term high satisfaction aspect education visual performing art ranked lowest satisfaction greatest number area
The study also found woman expressed le job satisfaction male colleague
The survey conducted Coache included response assistant professor public private university across country
The survey result mathematically precise ranking disciplinary area researcher able devise rough hierarchy based often faculty member area expressed high low satisfaction aspect work life
Two area ended tie

Physical science
Humanities

Social science
Medical school health profession
Biological science

Education
Other profession journalism law architecture etc

Visual performing art
Health human ecology Kiernan Mathews Cathy Trower director research director Coache respectively said varying level subjectivity tenure process probably contributed gap physical science visual performing art
The issue physical science thing much concrete term expectation said Trower
If get grant get published get tenure
Satisfaction tenure clarity high among junior faculty member physical science visual art ranked among last
It harder define excellence art said Mathews
Expectations tenure also divided gender woman displaying significantly le satisfaction process men
Women expressed lower level satisfaction several area including number hour worked amount time research balance compatibility tenure track raising child
Shelley Correll associate professor sociology Stanford University said survey gender finding consistent campus across country
Almost university survey look woman harder time coordinating work family woman end work home work child care make work faculty member harder said
One Correll past study showed significantly higher proportion female professor male peer found workload excessive
She attributed pattern related child care greater source stress woman men
The stress outside workplace affect amount time research said
Londa Schiebinger director Stanford Michelle Clayman Institute Gender Research said found female faculty member take greater share housework male colleague
You take woman twice much home male counterpart said
Marc Goulden director data initiative University California Berkeley said past study found woman science married child percent le likely male counterpart achieve tenure entering job
He suggested Coache data highlight need institution offer new family policy resource
The gender gap remains consistent across survey academic discipline including field social science woman typically well represented
Trower suggested trend invalidates notion critical mass woman academe needed ensure gender equality
You would think well get woman discipline gender difference go away said Trower
And I think data saying enough necessarily woman
Despite imbalance humanity faculty member expressed high satisfaction ability raise child remaining tenure track
I think speaks fact humanity situation scientist feel said Trower
I think probably supportive culture men woman take time family

In case I quickly find better solution
Another frustration encountering problem I solve
In case I ask teammate assistance
Most software engineer like find solution like ask help
Most people would view job stressful little room error I long time learned deal stress
The field software engineering demanding many people put long hour year I learned limit number overtime hour per week I work
This helped avoid total burnout problem personal life
I become efficient job working smarter I need put many hour I

I great deal stress personal life included father ill terminal cancer I put charge team somewhat lacking talent
I difficult time letting team member fail since I felt would reflect poorly manager I completed work
Since I left management become senior member technical staff I much happier
At least bachelor degree Computer Science related field Mathematics Electrical Engineering required position Software Engineer major corporation
Many master doctorate degree
Graduating prestigious university definitely plus work experience gained paid internship position
The skill help person succeed field include love solving puzzle ability think logically intense concentration focus attention detail
A software engineer often work program ten thousand line code need retain mental image code laid interconnected ability think abstract term exceptional memory also important
People enjoy math word problem good solving would probably succeed field
I constantly recommend line work bright young people
It stable industry continue grow coming year
The work remains interesting long term pay well
If I friend considering line work I would ass education skill try honestly let know I thought would good fit job
Because I current company year I receive week paid time
I find enough
Because pressure work schedule I rarely take week vacation time
This also true many coworkers
The biggest myth Software Engineers While true fit stereotype guy poor social skill good computer love science fiction wide variety type people employed Software Engineers good job
My job provides satisfaction though I say move heart much
A year ago I began writing outlet side I would say move heart
I would retire Software Engineering work full time freelance writer book author
I think I able succeed field I always academically competitive
Also I grew three brother sister I used outnumbered men
I came age time feminist bad word I afraid stand right I felt bring denied
Finally I never felt I choose feminine family working Software Engineer
It possible thing
I Caucasian male currently working Registered Nurse
So I opposite problem I often male working given shift
Also I prove group woman I must able make first impression patient eludes capacity complete job daily basis
I find patient le accepting fact male nurse colleague male coworker
I low job satisfaction however looking return school become computer programmer I looking see I better job satisfaction
I much relate story workplace female working predominantly male position
I also experienced sexual harassment workplace well men taking credit work I done suggestion I made
I feel unfair woman prove working field dominated men
I strongly feel inappropriate relation someone work unprofessional
Yet stopped men approaching asking date asking phone number
I let know I intend dating anyone else office pretty much leave respect honesty

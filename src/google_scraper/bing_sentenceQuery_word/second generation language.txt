A computer language mean instruction data transmitted computer
Put another way computer language interface computer human
There various computer language differing complexity
For example information understandable computer expressed zero one binary language
However binary language incomprehensible human
Computer scientist find far efficient communicate computer higher level language
language grew research leading development structured programming
Structured programming based idea computer program written using three arrangement information
The arrangement called sequential selection iteration
In sequential arrangement programming instruction statement executed one
This order vital
The execution second statement dependent prior execution first statement
There flexibility built selection arrangement choice typically made IF THEN ELSE structure
Iteration also known loop structure
Loop structure specify many time loop executed
In word command executed number time task completed
PASCAL ALGOL example language
Examples structured language BASIC FORTRAN LISP
Refinements BASIC FORTRAN produced structured language
language rely modular construction
A module related set command
Each module language typically begin BEGIN statement end END statement
Assembly assembler language second generation computer language
By late language become popular
Assembly language consists letter alphabet
This make programming much easier trying program series zero one
As added programming assist assembly language make use mnemonic memory aid easier human The introduction compiler spurred development computer language
These language enable programmer create program file using command similar spoken English
computer language become major mean communication digital computer user
By International Business Machine Corporation IBM language attempt make communicating computer much like process thinking talking people possible
The problem computer still understands zero one compiler interpreter must still convert source code machine code computer understand

These language often used accessing database
language use graphical interface create language statement compiled language compiler
Some biggest computer business IBM Microsoft make visual programming solution creating new apps
Programming visual interface allows user easily understand complete programming task
structure based structure data structure use simple generalization dynamic array different lower bound
Like still linear closely based mode
language usually strong type hierarchical name structure better control name space allows efficient dynamic memory allocation
This hierarchical structuring increase control flow eliminates need confusing network
These control structure offer recursive procedure mode syntactic structure
language use word policy establish rule
During peak popularity many programmer took advantage unlimited generalization functionality produced desirable result undesirable consequence
These language specific particular type processor family processor environment
They occasionally used kernel device driver produce processing intensive game graphic
There limited career available want program language
These sometimes still used obsolete business system industrial machine manufacturing console
For example industrial production lumber manufacturing system still use archaic based program
A software programmer may find work similar industry maintaining trouble shooting programming old system
These computer programmer sometimes work office writing designing software control automated industrial machine equipment
But unlike computer programmer spend lot time production floor troubleshooting fixing machine problem
They must optimally delegate machine task feeding routine tool selection product path shape pattern
They rely graphical user interface design development new solution well conduct daily calibration diagnostics
A second generation programming language outdated programming solution replaced efficient user friendly alternative
Anyone want become software learn exciting career

A generational way categorize computer
categorized
much machine independent
This includes feature like improved support aggregate data type expressing concept way favor programmer computer
A third generation language improves second generation language computer take care detail
feature abstraction previous generation language thus considered higher level language first second generation counterpart
First introduced late example early
Most popular language today also language although language subdivided category based contemporary trait
Most support
Many support
Traits like often used describe language rather
A programming language C FORTRAN Pascal enables programmer write program le independent particular type computer
Such language considered closer human language machine language hence require compilation interpretation
In contrast assembly language considered designed executed physical hardware without translation required
The main advantage language language easier read write maintain
Ultimately program written language must translated machine language compiler directly behaviour interpreter
These program could run different machine
As new abstract language developed however concept high low level language become rather relative
Many early high level language considered relatively low level comparison language feature

Just human use language communicate different region different language computer also language specific
Different kind language developed perform different type work computer
Basically language divided two category according computer understands
There also type language include These language mutually exclusive language belong multiple category
The term also open interpretation language considered considered language continued develop
computer language either machine code close
A computer understand instruction given language English
It understand execute instruction given form machine language
binary
There two type language Machine language lowest elementary level programming language first type programming language developed
Machine language basically language computer understand usually written hex
In fact manufacturer design computer obey one language machine code represented inside computer string binary digit bit
The symbol stand absence electric pulse stand presence electric pulse
Since computer capable recognizing electric signal understands machine language
Assembly language developed overcome many inconvenience machine language
This another important language operation code operand given form alphanumeric symbol instead l
These alphanumeric symbol known mnemonic code combine maximum combination
ADD addition SUB subtraction START LABEL etc
Because feature assembly language also known Symbolic Programming Language
This language also difficult need lot practice master little English support language
Mostly assembly language used help compiler orientation
The instruction assembly language converted machine code language translator executed computer
computer language use format similar English
The purpose developing language enable people write program easily native language environment English
language basically symbolic language use English word mathematical symbol rather mnemonic code
Each instruction language translated many machine language instruction computer understand
Many language developed achieving variety different task
Some fairly specialized others quite general
These language categorized according use These language oriented towards computational procedure solving mathematical statistical problem
Examples include These language best able maintain data processing procedure problem involved handling file
Some example include These used string manipulation including search pattern inserting deleting character
Examples In OOP computer program divided object
Examples These programming language designed building This resource used help write article

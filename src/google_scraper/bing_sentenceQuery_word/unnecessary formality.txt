In computer science formal language used among others basis defining grammar formalized version subset natural language word language represent concept associated particular meaning
In typically defined formal language defined set formal language limited computational power
In formal language used represent syntax philosophy mathematics reduced syntactic manipulation formal language way
The first formal language thought one used literally meaning concept writing Frege described formal language pure thought
early used rewriting string influential
An context formal language although often make sense use usual sense word generally
The element alphabet called
An alphabet may contain number element however definition formal language theory specify alphabet finite number element result apply
A alphabet finite sequence letter
The set word alphabet Σ usually denoted Σ using
The length word number letter composed
For alphabet one word length often denoted e ε λ even Λ
By one combine two word form new word whose length sum length original word
The result concatenating word empty word original word
In application especially alphabet also known word known break metaphor replaces metaphor
A alphabet Σ Σ set alphabet
Sometimes set word grouped expression whereas rule constraint may formulated creation expression
In computer science mathematics usually deal adjective formal often omitted redundant
While formal language theory usually concern formal language described syntactical rule actual definition concept formal language possibly infinite set string composed given alphabet le
In practice many language described rule
The notion may closer intuitive concept language one described syntactic rule
By abuse definition particular formal language often thought equipped formal grammar describes
The following rule describe formal language alphabet Σ Under rule string string
This formal language express addition addition equality express look like mean
For instance nowhere rule indication mean number zero mean addition
For finite language one explicitly enumerate word
For example describe language b ab cba
The case construction contains word
However even finite alphabet Σ b infinite number word potentially expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab
Therefore formal language typically infinite describing infinite formal language simple writing b ab cba
Here example formal language Formal language used tool multiple discipline
However formal language theory rarely concern particular language except example mainly concerned study various type formalism describe language
For instance language given Typical question asked formalism include Surprisingly often answer decision problem done extremely expensive characterization expensive
Therefore formal language theory major application area
Formal language may classified based expressive power generative grammar well complexity recognizing
provide good compromise expressivity ease widely used practical application
Certain operation language common
This includes standard set operation union intersection complement
Another class operation application string operation
Examples suppose language common alphabet
Such used investigate class language
A class language closed particular operation operation applied language class always produce language class
For instance known closed union concatenation intersection closed intersection complement
The theory study common closure property language family right
A compiler usually two distinct component
A generated tool like identifies token programming language grammar
expressed simpler formal language usually mean
At basic conceptual level usually generated like attempt decide source program valid belongs programming language compiler built
Of course compiler parse source code usually translate executable format
Because parser usually output answer typically
This used subsequent stage compiler eventually generate containing run directly hardware requires execute
In set expressed formal language
A also called consists formal language together also called
The deductive apparatus may consist set may interpreted valid rule inference set
A formal system used one expression one expression
Although formal language identified formula formal system likewise identified theorem
Two formal system may theorem yet differ significant way formula A may syntactic consequence formula B one another instance
A finite sequence formula may interpreted axiom follows preceding formula sequence
The last sentence sequence theorem formal system
Formal proof useful theorem interpreted true proposition
Formal language entirely syntactic nature may given give meaning element language
For instance mathematical set possible formula particular logic formal language assigns meaning
The study interpretation formal language called
In mathematical logic often done term
In model theory term occur formula interpreted object within fixed compositional interpretation rule determine truth value formula derived interpretation term formula interpretation term formula becomes true

They use Artificial Intelligence Embedded System Theory Of Computation Formal Verification etc
But widely used application Compiler check whether language written correct
Consider programming C language
So symbol type set consisting b A B set alphabet
Now wrote program include void main int b
In C program TOC string C basically set program indeed Infinite set
So program writing correct set correct C program impossible create linearly search
So TOC work given Language say C language work Finite Representation stored memory take string program decide whether valid C program
And Finite representation rule follow write program
Say check whether number open bracket equal number close bracket

The role software Engineer necessarily require degree Computer Science
However since Yahoo recently due fake computer science college degree point discussion someone need university degree
For instance article Dobb Andrew Binstock discus whether software engineer really require degree computer science perform excellent job
According Binstock Software engineer latest term undergo peculiar disconnection reality implies
In earlier generation title analyst favored term
In world yore entry level programmer
When change title needed reflect tenure programmer elevated
Then ultimately analyst
This metamorphosis might implied programming activity employee finally left behind
But fact analyst even programming junior brother
Analysis often large part job except insofar position require analysis adjunct programming
The article refers Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates software engineer successful without degree computer science
Thus Binstock conclusion The equivalent affords plenty room candidate demonstrated coding prowess lacking academic formation
In sum welcome party
And mind I raise pen dear reader software engineer
Not reader commented agree Binstock conclusion
For example user pjmlp explains In every profession learning path prof person question required set skill able offer certain quality work
My experience self taught programmer able deliver quality software shop expect skill set reduced able learn free time
RussG different viewpoint Sadly degree computer science reliably make one good programmer
Computer science computer programming generally different thing graduate seem come expectation work academia well large team building application
Another important point discussion context might specific role software engineering software architect
Does software architect responsible backbone system require computer science degree also self taught software engineer
Or engineer need academic education profound practical experience
As Einstein said In theory theory practice
In practice

By Peter LePiane The struggle
The project manager establish clear goal scope deliverable project
The client typically want deliverable delivered soon possible minimal overhead unnecessary formality
Especially project small
After introduce time effort required
Should small project exempt typical project management rigor medium large project
For sake article define small project le people including Project Sponsor Project Manager Subject Matter Experts Business Analysts Solution Developers budget le
Perhaps relationship total project effort effort expended project formality adherence methodology
If simple
Small necessarily translate straightforward
One would assume organization would recommend prescriptive approach project management project would PMI
Surprisingly Introduction PMBOK state Good practice mean knowledge described always applied uniformly project project management team responsible determining appropriate given project
So project management prescription small project sponsored someone want see project deliverable
The answer I call formality really different Introduction PMBOK alluding
As project manager developed tool technique template
For u undoubtedly level project management formality comfortable
If formality line comfort crossed start get nervous feel like project loaded risk
The best way avoid conflict client level formality applied project communicate minimum level formality front clearly possible
Know project rigor feel comfortable omitting importantly feel comfortable omitting set ground rule project early client
Once know boundary project management formality must understand client boundary
If client organization experience project used project management methodology template may able propose formality
However client experience project management formality likely start minimum level formality work point
Armed understanding client exposure experience project management negotiate establish process template technique project management methodology applied client
Because spent time carefully consider minimum level formality also would conducted simplified analysis piece formality
It analysis must modified based Understand Your Client step would conducted presented client understand upside may perceive pure overhead
It frequently part job project manager sell benefit methodology technique tool profession
This would one time
Based experience project manager painful doubt know worked
You clear picture yield project success
If best effort sell client see benefit see cost walk away
There nothing wrong professionally stating client believe able deliver project exceed expectation
It much better come understanding client project start rather reached point project might fail
Small project often seem like simple project
We proudly state statistic project resume LinkedIn profile like managed team international developer successfully delivered project implement
These large number seem carry implication complexity challenge
We le proud project manager smaller project successfully deliver

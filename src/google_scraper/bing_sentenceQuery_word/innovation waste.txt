The report analysis patent application relating recycling three main category namely technology recycling recovering material plastic metal source processing
battery cabling printed circuit board process logistics involved treatment magnetic sorting
The report show patenting activity gathered pace around subsided short took around
The bulk innovation taking place Asia followed Europe US Japanese consumer electronics metal firm Panasonic Hitachi Toshiba representing largest dominant patent portfolio percent activity
China also emerging key player domestic patenting activity increasing six year
The US make small proportion activity active recovery rare earth
Many patent application however domestic filed one jurisdiction
For example patent application first filed China filed another patent authority
The author suggest related fact processing occurs primarily Asia little need Asian company protect technology Europe US
They also suggest reflects scatter gun approach patenting Asian entity far applicant filing many diverse technology speculatively
Conversely Europe Japan US patent application tend filed multiple jurisdiction emphasis developing targeted higher value vetted technology require greater expensive protection regime
longer exclusively environmental public health issue
The report also point strongly commoditization electronic waste large increase patent activity relating recovery valuable rare earth metal
lanthanum neodymium praseodymium commonly used modern electronic device recovery noble metal gold silver platinum stream
The data indicate recovery rare earth metal emerging area interest one broadly protected multiple jurisdiction
They also reveal concentration activity relation rare earth extraction
The US hold highest absolute number patent family area
This trend partially explained fact China account per cent primary extraction rare earth element normally sold commodity open market subject strict export control
Major electronics manufacturer US Japan Europe therefore incentive seek alternative source rare earth need
Between patent activity doubled sector
The report also highlight relationship international flow stream specialization commercial entity within destination country
For example Chinese patent application area tend deal dismantling separation waste stream focused electronic component printed circuit board battery suggesting stream prior reaching China
The report identifies three primary sector innovation processing decontamination chemical separation metal extraction
The patent landscape report also indicates correlation change legislation patenting behavior
For example although plastic ferrous metal primary item recovered recent year sharp increase recovery lead tin especially silver copper
Silver primary noble metal extracted stream
This development appears driven implementation replace poisonous lead solder alloy new pure tin silver copper soldering technology
The report indicates extensive growth patenting activity technology dealing hazardous cadmium battery dismantling use conveyor belt logistics waste stream sorting operation recovery rare earth material
With respect mobile device strongly tied computing equipment within patent literature growth sector mobile device recovery focused primarily component includes growing emphasis battery printed circuit board increasing use chemical separation technique decontamination mobile device waste stream recovery silver mobile device
Rare earth metal used small amount almost consumer electronic device contain laser

A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity
An Android developer authority computer copy editor Shakespeare Keats
Instead larger lesson may developer realistic career opportunity school upfront program lead

Ready learn
Let work together make great thing possible
We design solution world greatest challenge
We always looking great talent join global team

Around half Australian household computer use Internet home
In nation fair bet computer reading story first
But happened old computer
By Tanya Ha Growing mountain accumulating around globe
In Australia seen rapid uptake new technology VCRs personal organiser DVD player
Culturally somewhat proud attitude
We feel reflects willingness accept rather resist change
Australia currently one top ten country using information communication technology ranking tenth world spending per caput fifth world spending percentage gross domestic product
In short love spending money gadget
However constant drive newest latest product come inevitable wastage product supersede
Obsolete electronic good one fastest growing waste type problem global
New electronic equipment technology constantly developed rapid adoption technology increasing speed technology reach obsolescence
Andy old PR officer bought first computer
got PC package colour inkjet printer
The last year various employer seen Andy main computer change time
Each computer sat desk average eighteen month
There estimated million computer use around Australia
It expected year million computer enter market million reach end life
This amount thousand tonne made obsolete computer along broken monitor used toner ink cartridge modem printer range peripheral consumables
The question Where Andy rest Australia unwanted computer IT waste gone
So computer longer need
Give away
Trash
Recycle
I paid hundred get Pentium processor modem old I could use internet home say Andy
Eventually I longer needed
Even upgrade I could give away
No one wanted
Andy sat garage four year gave Computerbank organisation recycles computer donates disadvantaged community group
Andy alone
It estimated around million computer disposed landfill million put storage addition million already gathering dust garage storage area million recycled Australia alone
In Australia reasonably good recycling council collection
The material collected kerbside collection largely simple material glass aluminium mixed paper sorted resold commodity market
The difficulty electronic waste many product made huge range component material useless manufacture product dismantled component material separated often difficult expensive process
Computers electronic equipment made hundred different material
Many material inherently valuable gold platinum many
If extracted reused manufacture raw material
There also nasties
Heavy metal including lead cadmium mercury arsenic used electronic equipment
When disposed leach landfill tip water table
retardant used computer equipment occupational environmental health threat
Printer ink toner often contain toxic material carbon black cadmium
It environmental health implication put spotlight international government environmentalist alike
Realising risk heavy metal toxin many developed nation quick place restriction disposal certain type
Unfortunately concern problem country stretched far local environment
In USA consumer take certain comfort program offer recycle obsolete computer
However program recycle locally
Some begin program meet difficulty
Some downright attempt
Last year Basel Action Network Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition released alarming report Exporting Harm The Asia
The report found collected recycling United States exported developing nation China India Pakistan environment polluted local men woman child exposed toxin
In USA local recycling facility operate strict occupational health safety standard
Many people first world idea recycling really look like developing nation
Recycling centre sprung developing nation cater exported waste
Electronic good reused recycled unregulated unsafe condition
In town like Guiyu China uncommon see open burning plastic wire smelting circuit board reclaim metal
Riverbank acid bath used extract gold
cathode ray tube monitor television set render much marketable value dumped
Toner cartridge pulled apart manually sending cloud toner dust air
The worker child generally work without facemasks protective clothing
Guiyu ground water polluted drinking water trucked away
International outrage trafficking hazardous waste led drafting adoption Basel Convention United Nations Environment Programme
The Basel Convention legally binding international agreement developed address problem uncontrolled movement dumping hazardous waste across international boundary particularly developing nation
Australia ratified Basel Convention hazardous waste exported Australia permit granted shown waste managed environmentally sound manner country import
Under Hazardous Waste Act exporting hazardous waste without permit offence punishable fine million imprisonment five year
country ratified Basel agreement ensuring level international cooperation may limit growth centre
The Bush Administration already received widespread criticism placing commercial interest environmental opposition Kyoto agreement
The Basel agreement brings sense de ja vu original Basel Convention signatory nation Haiti Afghanistan guessed United States America ratified Convention
Perhaps society biggest problem waste type backward approach wait waste problem think solving
According Helen Lewis Director Centre Design RMIT University tackling problem source often cheaper effective trying solve problem end line
A lot attention focused waste legislator answer could coming product designer say Lewis
And would know spent number year Manager Industry Programs state government waste authority EcoRecycle Victoria
If serious addressing waste problem need start work design stage product life cycle
Products better designed last longer environmentally responsible easily dismantled recycled end life
The Centre Design RMIT University leader growing field Design Environment
This approach design ensures environmental impact including pollution waste considered minimised stage product life disposal stage
Design Environment fit broader theme concept Extended Producer Responsibility EPR
EPR involves producer original equipment manufacturer taking responsibility managing environmental impact product throughout life
In word making producer pay
The European Parliament Directive Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment affectionately known highlight EPR key component solution growing problem
Other study including Environment Australia Product Stewardship Discussion Paper say thing producer design product better le harmful environment last longer therefore need recycled replaced often
They also call original equipment manufacturer take used product back recycle dispose responsibly
There Australian initiative starting assault mountain starting small
A year ago Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association AMTA started mobile phone battery recycling program
AMTA partnered environment group Planet Ark educate Australian public program
Hundreds thousand mobile phone recycled recovering gold nickel copper plastic manufacturing keeping cadmium battery landfill therefore water table
This program role model mobile phone recycling program overseas recycling program type electronic waste
More recently resource recovery specialist Close Loop Ltd developed toner cartridge processing technology form Machine
This new technology enables cartridge suited remanufacturing recycled component material reuse virtually zero waste landfill outcome
The first Machine work away outer suburb Melbourne complying Australia strict occupational health safety standard
Unlike situation Guiyu machine specially designed protect worker prevent fine toner dust posing explosion risk extract residue toner
Close Loop joined force Planet Ark printer industry develop cartridge recycling program Australian public
The initiative Planet Ark remanufacture recycle make model toner ink cartridge including toner drum photocopier fax cartridge
Many printer manufacturer involved program incorporating EPR program
Information collected recycling process fed back manufacturer future product designed easier recycling
The program seeking ISO ISO accreditation
The technology allows cartridge waste processed locally taking away need export potentially hazardous waste
Because worldwide printer industry closely watching program view implementing similar program overseas
Mobile phone printer cartridge one thing computer bigger bulkier consideration
However progress made computer recycling
Last Summer Resource NSW NSW government waste authority Australian Information Industry Association ran IT
pilot computer recycling program
Dell one Australia leading computer company launched national computer recycling program recycle competitor brand computer
The success computer recycling program globally remains seen seen role model program mobile phone printer cartridge work
The next stage see new electronic product designed environment mind
Maybe Andy current hardware last longer predecessor
All Andy employer worry buying new software operating system upgrade another story

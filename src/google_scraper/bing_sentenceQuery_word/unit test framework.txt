What Mocking
Prologue If look noun dictionary find one definition word
Mocking primarily used unit testing
An object test may dependency complex object
To isolate behaviour object want test replace object mock simulate behavior real object
This useful real object impractical incorporate unit test
In short mocking creating object simulate behaviour real object
At time may want distinguish opposed
There may disagreement subject definition stub minimal simulated object
The stub implement enough behaviour allow object test execute test
A mock like stub test also verify object test call mock expected
Part test verifying mock used correctly
To give example You stub database implementing simple structure storing record
The object test read write record database stub allow execute test
This could test behaviour object related database database stub would included let test run
If instead want verify object test writes specific data database mock database
Your test would incorporate assertion written database mock
There plenty answer SO good post web mocking
One place might want start looking post Martin Fowler discus lot idea mocking
In one paragraph Mocking one particlar technique allow testing unit code reliant upon dependency
In general differentiates mocking method mock object used replace code dependency allow expectation set mock object know meant called code respond
Your original question mentioned TypeMock I left answer TypeMock name
It offer feature free mocking framework like RhinoMocks Moq plus powerful option
Whether need TypeMock highly debatable mocking would ever want free mocking library many argue ability offered TypeMock often lead away well encapsulated design
As another answer stated actually defined concept could taken mean type mocking TypeMock offer using CLR profiler intercept call runtime giving much greater ability fake object requirement needing interface virtual method
Other answer explain mocking
Let walk
And believe actually far simpler think
It subclass original class
It data injected avoid testing injected part solely testing rest code
Let say writing iOS application network job test application
To whether network call work expected NOT YOUR DUTY
It another party duty test
You must remove network dependency yet continue test code work
A network call return different status code etc JSON response
Your app suppose work case error app throw expected error
What mocking create real network response like code JSON file test code without real network call waiting network response
You manually network response ALL different kind see app working expect
incorrect data responsibility responsibility test app correct case test app throw right error This creating real known mocking
In order CA use original code original code response right
You MUST add something dummy data normally needed part class
So SUBCLASS original class add whatever network HTTPResponse data OR case failure pas correct errorString HTTPResponse need subclass ie class
Long story short mocking testing also make feed class depends
In example instead whether app work expect class A good example mocking Just skip minute
I really like part transcript Because testing want make sure function called
We need make sure called Mock simulates behavior real controlled way
Mock object used unit testing
Often method test call external service method within
These called dependency
Once mocked dependency behave way defined
With dependency controlled mock easily test behavior method coded
This Unit testing
The purpose mocking type sever dependency order isolate test specific unit
Stubs simple surrogate mock surrogate verify usage
A mocking framework tool help generate stub mock
Since original wording mention type mocking I got impression related TypeMock
In experience general term mocking
Please feel free disregard info specifically TypeMock
TypeMock Isolator differs mocking framework work modifying IL fly
That allows mock type instance framework mock
To mock framework must provide abstraction mock
TypeMock offer great flexibility expense clean runtime environment
As side effect way TypeMock achieves result sometimes get strange result using TypeMock
I would think use TypeMock isolator mocking framework would TypeMocking
It tool generates mock use unit test without need write code IoC mind
If mock involves network request another alternative real test server hit
You use service generate request response testing
Mocking generating simulate real object behaviour test Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Can someone please explain software framework
Why need framework
What framework make programming easier
It difficult tell asked
This question ambiguous vague incomplete overly broad rhetorical reasonably answered current form
For help clarifying question reopened
I late answer
But I would like share one example I thought today
If I told cut piece paper dimension surely would
But suppose I ask cut piece paper dimension
In case wo measuring time obviously would make frame help would able cut piece paper le time
So make framework would specific type task
Instead performing type task type application create framework facility together one nice packet hence providing abstraction application importantly many application
Technically framework
If making really really simple site think web back HTML CSS
And want make modern webapp actually use framework either
You instead choose write logic need every time
You write layer busy write custom SQL every single database access
You write authentication session handling layer
And template rending logic
And logic
And security function
And unit test framework make sure work fine
And go quite long time able benefit good usually well tested work dozen hundred developer may well better
You get build want rapidly without spend time building worrying much infrastructure item listed
You get done le time know framework code using extending likely done better
And cost
Investing time learning framework
But virtually every web dev attest definitely worth time spent learning get massive really massive benefit using whatever framework choose
first google hit btw explains quite well A software framework computer programming abstraction common code providing generic functionality selectively overridden specialized user code providing specific functionality
Frameworks special case software library reusable abstraction code wrapped Application programming interface API yet contain key distinguishing feature separate normal library
Software framework distinguishing feature separate library normal user application You may need may provide great shortcut developing application since contains lot already written tested functionality
The reason quite similar reason use software library
A lot good answer already let see I give another viewpoint
Simplifying thing quite bit view framework application complete except actual functionality
You plug functionality PRESTO
application
Consider say GUI framework
The framework contains everything need make application
Indeed often trivially make minimal application line source absolutely nothing give window management management menu button bar etc
That framework side thing
By adding application functionality plugging right place framework turn empty app nothing window management etc
real application
There similar type framework web apps apps etc
In case framework provides bulk tedious repetitive code hopefully provide actual problem domain functionality
This ideal
In reality course success framework highly variable
I stress simplified view framework
I using scary term like Inversion Control like although framework scary concept
Since beginner I thought I spare jargon go easy simile
I sure definition framework
Sometimes large set library called framework I think typical use word closer definition aioobe brought
This sum difference set library framework A framework defined set library say call u call How framework help
Because instead writing something scratch basically extend given working application
You get lot productivity way sometimes resulting application far elaborate could done time frame usually trade lot flexibility
A simple explanation A framework scaffold build application around
A framework generally provides base functionality use extend make complex application framework sort thing
Microsofts MVC framework good example
It provides everything need get ground building website using MVC pattern handle web request route like
All implement Controllers provide Views two construct defined MVC framework
The MVC framework handle calling controller rendering view
Perhaps best wording I hope help lowest level framework environment given set tool work tool come form library configuration file etc
environment provides basic setup error reporting log file language setting etc modified extended built upon
People actually need framework matter wanting save time others matter personal preference
People justify framework code scratch
But people confusing library framework
I biased I actually using framework right
A framework provides particular problem area
Definition A software framework computer programming abstraction common code providing generic functionality selectively overridden specialized user code providing specific functionality
Frameworks special case software library reusable abstraction code wrapped Application programming interface API yet contain key distinguishing feature separate normal library
A framework help u using already created metaphore like think earth material programming language example camera program decided create notebook
You need recreate camera everytime use earth framework example technology store take camera integrate notebook
A framework function may need
maybe need sort array inbuilt sorting mechanism
Or maybe need window want place control find framework
kind WORK span FRAME around work
EDIT OK I dig guy trying tell perhaps havent noticed information line WORK span FRAME around getting fallen deeper n deeper
I try give floor hoping gracfully good explanation question Difference Library Framework I found Beyond definition sometimes understandable already understand example helped
I think I got glimmer understanding loooking sorting list example framework providing functionality tailored user code providing specific functionality
Take IComparer
The sort algorithm resides framework Sort method need series compare object A come object B
But Sort clue compare type sorted know
You could write comparison sort algorithm reused many user anticipate various type called upon sort
You got leave bit work user
So sort aka framework call back method user code type sorted compare
Or delegate used point
Did I get right
In General A frame Work real Conceptual structure intended serve support Guide building thing expands structure something useful asked viewed active site design logo Stack Exchange Inc user contribution licensed

Last night I saw Kevlin Henney ACCU London presentation I looking forward talk I started working unit test framework
I satisfied framework I found decided write
I guiding principle I felt I come I called framework YACUTS Yet Another Unit Test System typical test look something like If someValue returned someOtherValue returned I get result like Which I thought pretty good
I really like way expression broken two macro thought reasonable price pay unprecedented level expressiveness
I think whether expression template could help see way around
So I sat straight Kevlin showed achieved goal something like following What I focusing pulled macro
You pas complete expression decomposes get value LHS RHS original expression string evaluated result
The detail achieved much go I remember sufficiently good job anyway
But core trick used able grab first value put case overloading operator get RHS create capturing mechanism involving operator
The reason significant twofold happens highest precedence overloadable operator nobody else us well almost
As result introduce expression capture everything next operator level
There going interesting
Kevlin spent talk building idea test case proposition specification
The end result something grammatically encourages declarative specification driven flow assertion
His mechanism also allows use string test name proposition name declare specification scoped variable without need setup class specification really function
As well slight shift emphasis also drop small amount ceremony welcome technique
Interestingly although I fully implemented I experimented using string test name even though unit test case still function
My mechanism completely generate hide function name use string pas auto registration function
However reuse state test I still declare class although test could function method Kevlin approach still improvement
What interested perhaps Kevlin I could although interesting
But rather remarkably similar rest code looked mine
I know Sam Saariste also worked similar idea Jon Jagger although far I think
It seems converging goal large extent implementation
Given already beaten track reassures naturalness progression transcends effort
Having said I think I prefer name Yacuts Kevlin LHR London Heathrow environs work conceived UPDATE I since fleshed framework called CATCH
The announcement ACCU website contains pointer video talk Skills Matter
Thanks Martin
Sorry I see comment stuck moderation queue
I know video online
I shall watch

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
It seems everyone us without even considering option
I think Am I wrong
I decided use one project recently I love
It make much sense conceptually seems like definite step forward NUnit
I like hear opinion framework actually best taking consideration learn reconfigure automated testing
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
I personally use MSTest
NUnit really nice MSTest already fully integrated IDE full project template
For using I think MSTest way go MSTest I think par simply code coverage test runner tool available box
If use CodeRush R really great test testing framework Edit I since moved XUnit
D I started use several year ago
And feature gem provides powerful I never regretted choice
In fact I part development team Gallio OSS project I contribute make even awesome
The certainly good starting point discover Gallio MbUnit
It sill miss chapter quiet useful already
Picking one using perhaps important step
Personally I would choose reason
First foremost tooling support
There major party plugins support
Every single build system test coverage utility CI server support
In many case without plugin
On code level handle scenario point data driven test inheritance abstract test class generic test class setup tear etc
To extent NUnit got feature rich powerful
Beyond NUnit I think could make pretty decent argument MBUnit Gallio mentioned Yann solid framework
The one avoid possible would MSTest fatal flaw IMHO
Flaws constraint test class inheritance dependency professional better visual studio SKUs
Including requiring visual studio installed build server order run test
The one reason NUNIT become industry standard xUnit
But personally love xunit

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

The International Monetary Fund defines foreign direct investment FDI investment allows investor significant voice management enterprise operating outside investor country
The phrase significant voice usually mean ownership per cent ordinary share voting power incorporated enterprise equivalent unincorporated enterprise
This may involve either creating entirely new greenfield typically changing ownership existing enterprise via merger acquisition
Other type financial transaction related enterprise reinvesting earnings FDI enterprise also defined FDI
The Inward FDI Performance Index capture country relative success attracting global FDI
If country share global inward FDI match relative share global GDP country Inward FDI Performance Index equal one
A value greater one indicates larger share FDI relative GDP value le one indicates smaller share FDI relative GDP
A negative value mean foreign investor disinvested period
FDI typically considered significant lagging indicator investment environment
Once given project acquisition decided upon take time fund delivered
Therefore examining data FDI inflow given year generally provide full picture investor sentiment particular year
Flows time also considered
Canada rank country inward FDI earns D grade
Canada attracted per cent world FDI accounted per cent world GDP
Eight peer country including Canada Inward FDI Performance Index greater one meaning country attract inward FDI economic size would suggest
Although index result suggests Canada relatively attractive market foreign investment significantly lag top peer performer like Belgium Ireland Denmark
Belgium achieved inward FDI index result three time higher comparator country Ireland
Belgium FDI index result never dipped twice exceeded result past decade
Why Belgium special case
It work actively attract inward foreign direct investment using tax incentive lower corporate income tax create business environment
Belgian firm recycle capital corporate entity country form loan
Consequently Belgium one internationalized economy world foreign affiliate accounting per cent manufacturing job per cent service job
Ten country fall Canada inward FDI ranking receive D grade
Of ten country eight attracting global share FDI equal size economy Inward FDI Performance Index le one
For example index placing among peer group
In Japan Switzerland actually saw net negative result Inward FDI Performance Index meaning stock inward FDI declined
This weak result reflects variety factor including impact tsunami earthquake Japan business strategy negative asset valuation adjustment firm impact dividend payment transfer pricing
With trade liberalization rise global supply chain FDI used increasingly restructure business operation stimulate trade enhance profitability thus expanding national wealth
Traditional international trade theory saw FDI substitute international way avoid tariff setting branch plant another market
The new international trade integrative trade inward FDI enhances ability firm country expand production resulting economic activity job income gain
Countries compete attract FDI inflow international business activity
FDI become key driver global economic growth
FDI activity increased around world outpacing growth production international trade
In global GDP increased average per cent per year flow FDI worldwide grew per cent per year
Countries compete attract FDI FDI inflow help boost productivity
FDI encourages diffusion technology management well efficient resource allocation
Subsidiaries acquire new knowledge technology international parent
Domestic firm interact subsidiary also benefit transfer technology knowledge
Ultimately FDI lead higher productivity improved quality product increased competitiveness
Studies show firm average per cent productive domestically controlled firm superior technological managerial
Inward FDI also increase pool investment capital
Rather replacing domestic investment FDI supplement capital shortfall help develop home capital market creating additional export possibility
Finally inward FDI increase revenue government directly tax paid foreign investor indirectly additional employment income tax sale tax generated increased consumer spending
Since Canada ranking foreign direct investment inflow slipping
In Canada scored A ability attract FDI
This dropped B disappointing D average rebounding C
Canada share global inward FDI stock fell average per cent average per cent period
To better understand Canada FDI performance Ottawa The Conference Board Canada
Ottawa The Conference Board Canada
Canada lost lustre three main factor affect FDI investment decision Investment obtain Canadian market access declined Canadian market relatively small North American Free Trade Agreement attracted predicted investment Canada
Canada receives higher share FDI primary resource sector country
But Canada natural resource attractive foreign investor costly explore exploit elsewhere
Multinational enterprise looking operational efficiency dissuaded Canada low productivity relative peer
Canada low productivity reflects lower capital intensity lack sufficient investment research development R D area would foster innovation
Although Canada skilled workforce need specialized worker engineer scientist technician compete investment
Canada neither low cost production developing country scale production large economy like United States
Another barrier foreign often cited reason relatively low inward FDI Canada
Although step taken reduce regulatory barrier foreign investment recent case BHP Billiton aborted effort purchase PotashCorp well controversy CNOOC acquisition Nexen may created impression arbitrary policy foreign acquisition Canada
Reduced regulatory barrier greater clarity decision taken would help build Canada attractiveness investment destination
The remains world favoured FDI destination country yet popularity diminished recent decade
In held per cent global inward FDI stock
This share fell per cent
China share global FDI stock grew per cent per cent transition economy increased share per cent per cent
Although manufacturing sector still occupies top position per cent inward FDI stock Canada mining energy sector slowly climbed second place per cent
Management company enterprise crept third place per cent share finance insurance industry fourth place per cent
Filip De Beule Daniel Van Den Bulck New York Vale Columbia Center Sustainable International Investment
The ratio country share global foreign direct investment FDI inflow share global gross domestic product GDP

In phenomenon whereby larger entity arise interaction among smaller simpler entity larger entity exhibit property entity exhibit
Emergence play central role theory
For instance phenomenon studied emergent property phenomenon emerge phenomenon living thing
In philosophy theory emphasize emergent property called
Almost account emergentism include form irreducibility lower level
In philosophy emergence often understood claim system property
An emergent property system context one property component system still feature system whole
one first modern philosopher write emergence termed new category
This idea emergence around since least time
two many scientist philosopher written concept
The term emergent coined philosopher wrote Every resultant either sum difference force sum direction difference direction contrary
Further every resultant clearly traceable component
It otherwise emergents instead adding measurable motion measurable motion thing one kind individual kind thing unlike kind
The emergent unlike component insofar incommensurable reduced sum difference
Economist provided current definition emergence journal
Goldstein initially defined emergence arising novel coherent structure pattern property process complex system
Goldstein definition elaborated describe quality definition detail The common characteristic radical novelty feature previously observed system coherence correlation meaning integrated whole maintain period time A global macro level
property wholeness product dynamical process evolves ostensive perceived
Systems scientist Peter Corning also say living system reduced underlying law physic Usage notion emergence may generally subdivided two perspective weak emergence strong emergence
In term physical system weak emergence type emergence emergent property amenable computer simulation
This opposed older notion strong emergence emergent property simulated computer
Some common point two notion emergence concern new property produced system grows say one shared component prior state
Also assumed property rather metaphysically primitive
Weak emergence describes new property arising system result interaction elemental level
However stipulated property determined observing simulating system process analysis
Bedau note weak emergence universal metaphysical solvent weak emergence lead conclusion matter contains element awareness
However Bedau concludes adopting view would provide precise notion emergence involved consciousness second notion weak emergence metaphysically benign
Strong emergence describes direct causal action system upon component quality produced way system constituent part
The whole sum part
An example physic emergence water seemingly unpredictable even exhaustive study property constituent atom hydrogen oxygen
It follows simulation system exist simulation would constitute reduction system constituent part
However debate whether whole predicted property part miss point
Wholes produce unique combined effect many effect may context interaction whole environment
In accordance Synergism Hypothesis Corning also stated It effect produced whole cause evolution complexity nature
Novelist Arthur Koestler used metaphor symbol unity underlying complement like illustrate two perspective strong weak treated work together address issue emergence
Further The ability reduce everything simple fundamental law imply ability start law reconstruct universe
The constructionist hypothesis break confronted twin difficulty scale complexity
At level complexity entirely new property appear
Psychology applied biology biology applied chemistry
We see whole becomes merely different sum part
The plausibility strong emergence questioned contravening usual understanding physic
Mark Bedau observes Although strong emergence logically possible uncomfortably like magic
How irreducible supervenient downward causal power arise since definition due aggregation potentiality
Such causal power would quite unlike anything within scientific ken
This indicates discomfort reasonable form materialism
Their mysteriousness heighten traditional worry emergence entail illegitimately getting something nothing
Strong emergence criticized causally
The canonical example concern emergent mental state M supervene physical state P respectively
Let M emergent property
Let supervene base property
What happens M cause
say In schematic example concluded M cause causing
So M cause
Now M emergent must emergence base property say Now face critical question emergent M emerges basal condition P P displace M cause putative effect M
Why P work explaining alleged effect M occurred
If causation understood nomological sufficiency P M emergence base nomologically sufficient M cause nomologically sufficient
It follows P nomologically sufficient hence qualifies M somehow retained cause faced highly implausible consequence every case downward causation involves overdetermination since P remains cause well
Moreover go spirit emergentism case emergents supposed make distinctive novel causal contribution
If M cause overdetermined also thought determined One escape route strong emergentist could take would deny
However would deny emergent mental state must supervene physical state turn would deny thus unpalatable philosopher physicist
Meanwhile others worked towards developing analytical evidence strong emergence
In Gu et al
presented class physical system exhibit macroscopic property
More precisely one could compute certain macroscopic property system microscopic description system one would able solve computational problem known undecidable computer science
They concluded Although macroscopic concept essential understanding world much fundamental physic devoted search everything set equation perfectly describe behavior fundamental particle
The view goal science rest part rationale theory would allow u derive behavior macroscopic concept least principle
The evidence presented suggests view may overly optimistic
A everything one many component necessary complete understanding universe necessarily one
The development macroscopic law first principle may involve systematic logic could require conjecture suggested experiment simulation insight
Emergent structure pattern emerge via collective action many individual entity
To explain pattern one might conclude per emergent structure sum part assumption emergent order arise various part simply interact independently one another
However
According argument interaction part immediate surroundings cause complex chain process lead order form
In fact system nature observed exhibit emergence based upon interaction autonomous part others exhibit emergence least present reduced way
In particular method theoretical physic enables scientist study system tractable combination part
The property complexity organization system considered Crutchfield determined observer
Defining structure detecting emergence complexity nature inherently subjective though essential scientific activity
Despite difficulty problem analysed term observer infer measurement computational capability embedded process
An observer notion ordered random complex environment depends directly computational resource amount raw measurement data memory time available estimation inference
The discovery structure environment depends critically subtly though resource organized
The descriptive power observer chosen implicit computational model class example overwhelming determinant finding regularity data
On hand argues Must synergy order qualify emergent effect theorist claim
Most emphatically
The synergy associated emergence real measurable even nobody observe
In religion emergence ground expression sense perceived working entirely naturalistic process form arise evolve simpler form
Examples detailed
An early argument emergence social formation part stemming religion found famous work
In art emergence used explore origin novelty creativity authorship
Some theorist Wheeler Alexander proposed alternative postmodern understanding authorship using complexity science emergence theory
They contend artistic selfhood meaning emergent relatively objective phenomenon
used emergence describe experience work art relation contemporary neuroscience
In international development concept emergence used within theory social change termed show standard principle interact bring forward development fitted cultural value community economics natural environment local solution emerging larger
These principle implemented utilizing sequence standardized task individually specific way utilizing recursive evaluative criterion
In postcolonial study term Emerging Literature refers contemporary body text gaining momentum global literary landscape v

By opposition emergent literature rather concept used theory literature
An emergent behavior emergent property appear number simple agent operate environment forming complex behavior collective
If emergence happens disparate size scale reason usually causal relation across different scale
In word often form feedback system emergent property
The process emergent property result may occur either observed observing system commonly identified pattern accumulating change generally called
Emergent behaviour occur intricate causal relation across different scale feedback known
The emergent property may either predictable unpredictable unprecedented represent new level system evolution
The complex behaviour property property single entity easily predicted deduced behaviour entity might fact irreducible behavior
The shape behaviour flock bird school fish good example emergent property
One reason emergent behaviour hard predict number component system increase exponentially number component thus potentially allowing many new subtle type behaviour emerge
Emergence often product particular pattern interaction
introduces constraint serve fix structure behaviour
In contrast promotes change allowing local variation grow global pattern
Another way interaction lead emergent property
This occurs interaction applied intermittently leading two phase one pattern form grow refined removed
On hand merely large number interaction enough guarantee emergent behaviour many interaction may negligible irrelevant may cancel
In case large number interaction fact work emergence interesting behaviour creating lot noise drown emerging signal emergent behaviour may need temporarily isolated interaction reach enough critical mass
Thus sheer number connection component encourages emergence also connection organised
A hierarchical organisation one example generate emergent behaviour bureaucracy may behave way quite different individual human bureaucracy perhaps interestingly emergent behaviour also arise decentralized organisational structure marketplace
In case system reach combined threshold diversity organisation connectivity emergent behaviour appears
side effect closely related emergent property
writes A component particular functionality recognizable subfunction global functionality
Instead component implement behaviour whose side effect contributes global functionality Each behaviour side effect sum side effect give desired functionality
In word global macroscopic functionality system emergent functionality sum side effect emergent property functionality
Systems emergent property emergent structure may appear defy principle second law form increase order despite lack command central control
This possible open system extract information order environment
Emergence help explain fallacy
Emergent structure found many natural phenomenon physical biological domain
For example shape weather phenomenon emergent structure
The development growth complex orderly driven water molecule within conducive natural environment another example emergent process give rise complex deeply attractive orderly structure
However crystalline structure hurricane said phase
It useful distinguish three form emergent structure
A emergent structure occurs result shape interaction example water molecule lead
A emergent structure involves shape interaction played sequentially time example changing atmospheric condition snowflake fall ground build upon alter form
Finally emergent structure consequence shape time heritable instruction
For example organism set interaction biological system space time
In emergence used describe property law phenomenon occurs macroscopic scale space time microscopic scale despite fact macroscopic system viewed large ensemble microscopic system
An emergent property need complicated underlying property generate
For instance law remarkably simple even law govern interaction component particle complex
The term emergence physic thus used signify complexity rather distinguish law concept apply macroscopic scale one apply microscopic scale
Some example include sometimes used example emergent macroscopic behaviour
In classical dynamic instantaneous momentum large number particle equilibrium sufficient find average kinetic energy per degree freedom proportional temperature
For small number particle instantaneous momentum given time statistically sufficient determine temperature system
However using temperature still obtained arbitrary precision averaging momentum long enough time
liquid gas another example emergent macroscopic behaviour make sense considering differential temperature
particularly example system specifically whose structure determined constraint system random perturbation possible realization shape size cell depends temperature gradient well nature fluid shape container configuration actually realized due random perturbation thus system exhibit form
In theory particle physic even basic structure viewed emergent phenomenon arising fundamental concept
In interpretation perception reality object definite position momentum forth actually emergent phenomenon true state matter described instead need single position momentum
Most law experience today appear emerged course time making emergence fundamental principle universe raising question might fundamental law physic others emerged
turn viewed emergent property law physic
including biological viewed emergent property law chemistry
Similarly could understood emergent property neurobiological law
Finally theory understand emergent feature psychology
According Laughlin many particle system nothing calculated exactly microscopic equation macroscopic system characterised broken symmetry symmetry present microscopic equation present macroscopic system due phase transition
As result macroscopic system described terminology property depend many microscopic detail
This mean microscopic interaction irrelevant simply see anymore see renormalized effect
Laughlin pragmatic theoretical physicist possibly ever calculate broken symmetry macroscopic property microscopic equation point talking reducibility
major source complexity major process behind varying form life
In view evolution process describing growth complexity natural world speaking emergence complex living being view refers therefore process sudden change evolution
thought emerged early chain began express basic condition necessary natural selection operate conceived heritability variation type competition limited resource
RNA replicator per caput rate increase would likely function adaptive capacity intrinsic sense determined nucleotide sequence availability resource
The three primary adaptive capacity may capacity replicate moderate fidelity giving rise heritability variation type capacity avoid decay capacity acquire process resource
These capacity would determined initially folded configuration RNA replicators see turn would encoded individual nucleotide sequence
Competitive success among different replicators would depended relative value adaptive capacity
Regarding evolution observes Synergistic effect various kind played major causal role evolutionary process generally evolution cooperation complexity particular Natural selection often portrayed mechanism personified causal agency
In reality differential selection trait adaptation consequence functional effect produce relation survival reproductive success given organism given environment
It functional effect ultimately responsible continuity change nature
Per Corning also address emergence evolution In evolutionary process causation iterative effect also cause
And equally true synergistic effect produced emergent system
In word emergence underlying cause evolution emergent phenomenon biological evolution synergy produced organized system key
behaviour many animal specie
Emergent structure common strategy found many animal group colony ant mound built termite swarm bee fish flock bird mammal
An example consider detail
The queen give direct order tell ant
Instead ant reacts stimulus form chemical scent larva ant intruder food buildup waste leaf behind chemical trail turn provides stimulus ant
Here ant autonomous unit reacts depending local environment genetically encoded rule variety ant
Despite lack centralized decision making ant colony exhibit complex behavior even demonstrated ability solve geometric problem
For example colony routinely find maximum distance colony entrance dispose dead body
It appears environmental factor may play role influencing emergence
Research suggests induced emergence bee specie
In specie bee emerge pattern consistent rainfall
Specifically pattern emergence consistent southwestern desert late summer rain lack activity spring
A broader example emergent property biology viewed life ranging level entire
For example individual combined form chain turn refold form turn create even complex structure
These protein assuming functional status spatial conformation interact together molecule achieve higher biological function eventually create
Another example cascade reaction detailed arise individual gene mutating respective positioning
At highest level world form biosphere human participant form society complex interaction system stock market
Among considered phenomenon evolutionary account life continuous history marked stage fundamentally new form appeared origin sapiens intelligence
The emergence mind evolution researched considered separate phenomenon special system knowledge Groups human being left free regulate tend produce rather meaningless chaos often feared
This observed society least since ancient China
A classic good example car moving effective organization modern city begun replacing stoplight problem intersection traffic circle getting better result
project form even compelling illustration
Emergent process behaviour seen many place city phenomenon economics organizational phenomenon
Whenever multitude individual interacting one another often come moment disorder give way order something new emerges pattern decision structure change direction Miller
The market matter example emergence grand scale
As whole precisely regulates relative security price company across world yet leader place one entity control working entire market
Agents investor knowledge limited number company within portfolio must follow regulatory rule market analyse transaction individually large grouping
Trends pattern emerge studied intensively

The popular example decentralized system exhibiting emergent property
There central organization rationing number link yet number link pointing page follows page linked many time page seldom linked
A related property network link World Wide Web almost pair page connected relatively short chain link
Although relatively well known property initially unexpected unregulated network
It shared many type network called
pp
Internet traffic also exhibit seemingly emergent property
In congestion control mechanism flow become globally synchronized bottleneck simultaneously increasing decreasing throughput coordination
Congestion widely regarded nuisance possibly emergent property spreading bottleneck across network high traffic flow considered phase transition see review related research pp

Another important example emergence system also called collaborative tagging
In social bookmarking system user assign tag resource shared user give rise type information organisation emerges crowdsourcing process
Recent research analyzes empirically complex dynamic system shown consensus stable distribution simple form shared vocabulary indeed emerge even absence central controlled vocabulary
Some believe could user contribute tag use language share similar semantic structure underlying choice word
The convergence social tag may therefore interpreted emergence structure people similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information process called semantic imitation
Emergent structure appear many different
Emergent appears frequently planning zoning entity predetermines layout city

The interdisciplinary study emergent behavior generally considered field divided across application problem
Architects Landscape Architects may design pathway complex building
Instead might let usage pattern emerge place pavement pathway become worn
The action vehicle progression could possibly regarded example emergence

Eric Bonabeau attempt define emergent phenomenon traffic traffic jam actually complicated mysterious
On individual level driver trying get somewhere following breaking certain rule legal speed limit others societal personal slow let another driver change lane
But traffic jam separate distinct entity emerges individual behavior
highway example travel backward apparent reason even car moving forward
He also likened emergent phenomenon analysis market trend employee behavior
Computational emergent phenomenon also utilized architectural design process example formal exploration experiment digital materiality
Some artificially intelligent AI computer application utilize emergent behavior animation
One example mimic bird
It argued structure regularity least emergent phenomenon
While speaker merely try reach communicative goal us language particular way

It seems congregation realized change somehow trying exchange idea great someone explain difference emergent system chaotic system
That simply characterization behaviour
A chaotic system one exhibit behaviour
See also theory
It suggests given system behaviour linear like laminar flow air flow analysis
The term system actually misnomer
We speak property system
Like way complex system personality purport function differently purpose designed
Hi thanks
A chaotic system emergent system chaotic behavior emerges interaction system part
Chaos thing emerge system sometimes orderly behavior emerges
So short answer chaotic system emergent system

evolutionary theory rise system predicted explained condition
English philosopher distinguished resultant predictable part physical mixture sand talcum powder contrasted salt look nothing like sodium chlorine
The evolutionary account life continuous history marked stage fundamentally new form appeared origin life origin protozoa origin sexually reproducing form individual destiny lacking cell reproduce fission rise animal nervous system protobrains appearance cogitative animal namely human
Each new mode life though grounded physicochemical biochemical condition previous simpler stage intelligible term ordering principle
These thus case emergence
Early century British zoologist Lloyd one founder animal psychology emphasized antipode principle nothing called emergent unless shown resultant

Thus tend concentrate mechanism mutation effective change variety variety specie finding macroevolution origin great group living thing
Nevertheless concept emergence still figure evolutionary thinking

David Pines Distinguished Professor Physics UC Davis Chief Evangelist ICAM When electron atom people interact behavior whole different part
We call collective behavior
Emergence thus refers collective phenomenon behavior complex system exist individual part gateway emergence regularity characterize emergent behavior organizing principle may able explain
In science society developing emergent perspective mean focus identifying gateway emergent system behavior
Because emerging global challenge unique cause unique even best response
An emergent strategy address therefore involves pursuing simultaneously many different partial solution focus connection synergy among accelerate progress lead whole greater sum part
We live emergent universe interaction part people electron give rise emergent collective behavior different part separately generally unpredictable knowledge part interaction
To understand emergent universe scientist replacing traditional reductionist approach focus using individual component basic building block focus characterizing collective emergent behavior search collective organizing concept principle bring
These new basic building block use understand quantum matter living matter cosmos society live
In physical biological science carry experiment laboratory analyze observational data discover regularity characterize emergent behavior ask whether gateway emergent behavior identified one area might provide u useful insight origin emergent collective behavior another
An emergent perspective essential confront emerging global change troubled educational infrastructure system terrorism current global economic meltdown etc
These caused human searching appropriate response properly begin seeking identify origin societal behavior
But difference simpler system origin many unique
Moreover feedback leading behavior play significant role origin difficult identify nearly impossible separate
Armed emergent perspective right strategy
First keep clearly mind since emerging global challenge unique cause unique even best solution
Therefore right emergent strategy making progress pursue simultaneously many different partial solution searching synergy among
Second experiment experiment experiment monitor regularly one progress adapt adapt adapt one strategy pursuing
Third hesitate invent new institution
Emergence bulk property
When bring together component part system people society matter bulk behavior whole different part call resulting behavior From discovery novel ordered state quantum matter egg cooking bird flocking collective behavior ant colony development consciousness infant latest measurement early universe global climate change current global economic around u
More matter turn different almost always unpredictable knowledge component part interaction
We know simple equation govern immediate world find almost useless telling u emergent behavior encounter whether working problem frontier science cooking meal seeking understand change societal behavior
So must conclude dream twentieth century reductionists according Wikipedia reductionism either mean approach understand nature complex thing reducing interaction part simpler fundamental thing b philosophical position complex system nothing sum part account reduced account individual constituent Theory Everything hollow
Thus matter bulk acquires property different fundamental constituent electron nucleus recognize knowledge interaction make possible predict property whether one trying determine whether material becomes magnet novel superconductor say nothing understanding behavior cell living matter behavior neuron human brain
Feynman famously said life nothing wiggling jiggling atom tell u gave rise LUCA last universal ancestor progenitor living matter say nothing subsequent evolution
It follows need rethink role reductionism understanding emergent behavior physical biological social science
What replaces reductionist dream
The short answer recognition understanding emergent behavior requires change focus
Instead adopting traditional reductionist approach begin identifying individual constituent quark electron atom individual using basic building block building model emergent behavior focus instead identifying collective organizing concept principle characterize explain emergent behavior basic building block one need understand emergence
The chef cooking egg found experiment organizing principle work change state liquid easy shirred scrambled omelet soufflé learned pan butter temperature stove top oven added ingredient altitude especially play role determining outcome
The physical scientist studying bulk matter seek identify collective building block symmetry broken symmetry effective field criticality feedback energy landscape frustration quasiparticle collective mode coherent competing state universal scaling protected behavior etc
candidate system investigation understand range applicability
For physical scientist social scientist emergent strategy involves following step focus experimental regularity pattern possible scaling behavior experimental observational data obtained many different probe consult one catalogue organizing concept decide qualitative level candidate organizing concept might responsible important experimental regularity develop phenomenological description incorporates organizing principle link result obtained using different experimental probe put reductionist candidate microscopic theory proposing solving simplified toy model embodies candidate organizing principle
Both reductionist scientist emergent perspective focus fundamental
For reductionist individual constituent system force couple
For emergentist physical scientist emergent fundamental collective organizing principle bring emergent behavior system whole second law thermodynamics mechanism producing novel coherent state matter emerge material seek reduce entropy temperature lowered
The difference reductionist perspective emergent one also viewed term starting point ending point
In considering new problem turned laboratory posed observation reductionist focus outset solving standard model incorporates basic interaction individual component system
The scientist emergent perspective put reductionist hat much later toward end point research problem continued attention experimental result obtained using broad spectrum probe emergent behavior possible identify organizing principle must incorporated candidate model one nearly always quite different standard model reductionist
For citizen world leader alike emergent perspective essential confront emerging global change failed educational system terrorism current global economic meltdown etc
These caused human searching appropriate emergent response properly begin seeking identify origin societal behavior
But difference origin many unique
Moreover feedback leading behavior play significant role origin difficult identify nearly impossible separate
Armed emergent perspective right strategy
Emergent strategy making progress involve trying simultaneously many different partial solution inventing new institution pursuing
These involve well modifying approach information becomes available impact
accelerate progress priority given offer promise solving one problem time
accelerated using vastly improved communication tool available internet

This sequence value model variable saved large collection data often viewed computer screen using method visualization
Often certainly always method visualization designed output scientific simulation appears measuring system interest
Sometimes method computer simulation used model interest contains continuous differential equation specify continuous rate change time solved principle perhaps practice
This underwrites spirit following definition given Paul Humphreys method exploring property mathematical model analytic method available
But even narrow definition one read carefully taken suggest simulation used analytically unsolvable equation model
Computer simulation often used either original model contains discrete directly implemented algorithm suitable original model consists something better described
In former case equation discretized turning equation describe continuous rate change discrete equation emphasized although common speak simulation solving equation discretization best find something approximates solution continuous equation desired degree accuracy
Finally speaking computer simulation narrowest sense speaking particular implementation algorithm particular digital computer written particular language using particular compiler etc
There case different result obtained result variation particular
More broadly think computer simulation comprehensive method studying system
In broader sense term refers entire process
This process includes choosing model finding way implementing model form run computer calculating output algorithm visualizing studying resultant data
The method includes entire make inference target system one try well procedure used sanction inference
This le definition computer simulation Winsberg
Successful simulation study compute number
They make use variety technique draw inference number
Simulations make creative use calculational technique motivated
As unlike simple computation carried computer result simulation automatically reliable
Much effort expertise go deciding simulation result reliable When philosopher science write computer simulation make claim epistemological methodological property computer simulation usually mean term understood broad sense computer simulation study
Both definition take computer simulation fundamentally using computer solve approximately solve mathematical equation model meant represent real hypothetical
Another approach try define simulation independently notion computer simulation define computer simulation compositionally simulation carried programmed digital computer
On approach simulation system believed hoped dynamical behavior similar enough system former studied learn latter
For example study object believe sufficiently dynamically similar basin fluid u learn basin fluid studying provides simulation basin fluid
This line definition simulation find Hartmann something imitates one process another process
In definition term process refers solely object system whose state change time
Hughes objected Hartmann definition ruled simulation imitate structure rather dynamic
Humphreys revised definition simulation accord remark Hartmann Hughes follows Note Humphreys defining computer simulation simulation generally spirit defining compositional term
It noted Humphreys definition make simulation success term seems unfortunate
A better definition would one like one last section included word like believed hoped address issue
In philosophical discussion computer simulation useful concept one defined
The exception explicitly goal discussion understand computer simulation example simulation generally see section
Examples simulation computer simulation include famous physical model San Francisco Bay Huggins Schultz
This working hydraulic scale model San Francisco Bay Joaquin River Delta System built Army Corps engineer study possible engineering intervention Bay
Another nice example discussed extensively Dardashti et al
forthcoming use acoustic dumb hole made condensate study behavior Black Holes
Physicist Bill Unruh noted certain fluid something akin black hole would arise region fluid moving fast wave would move faster speed sound something order escape Unruh
Such region would effect sonic event horizon
Unruh called physical setup dumb hole dumb mute proposed could studied order learn thing know black hole
For time proposal viewed nothing clever idea physicist recently come realize using condensate actually build study dumb hole laboratory
It clear think setup simulation dumb hole simulates black hole
Instead finding computer program simulate black hole physicist find fluid dynamical setup believe good model model fundamental mathematical similarity model system interest
They observe behavior fluid setup laboratory order make inference black hole
The point definition simulation section try understand sense computer simulation sort activity specie genus
We might better situation understand simulation sense happens run computer overlap simulation sense
We come back section
Barberousse et al
however critical analogy
They point computer simulation work way Unruh simulation work
It case computer material object target system follow differential equation
A good reference simulation computer simulation Trenholme
Two type computer simulation often distinguished
Computer Simulations type used three different general sort purpose prediction pointwise understanding exploratory heuristic purpose
simulation commonly used physical science science governing theory guide construction mathematical model based differential equation
I use term equation based refer simulation based kind global equation associate physical opposed rule evolution discussed next section
Equation based simulation either n many discrete body set differential equation governing interaction set equation governing time evolution continuous medium field
An example former simulation galaxy formation gravitational interaction finite collection discrete body discretized time space
An example latter simulation fluid meteorological system like severe storm
Here system treated continuous field representing distribution relevant variable space discritized space updated discrete interval time
simulation common social behavioral science though also find discipline artificial life epidemiology ecology discipline networked interaction many individual studied
simulation similar simulation represent behavior discrete individual
But unlike simulation global differential equation govern motion individual
Rather simulation behavior individual dictated local rule To give one example famous groundbreaking simulation Thomas Schelling model The agent simulation individual lived chessboard
The individual divided two group society
two different race boy girl smoker etc
Each square board represented house one person per house
An individual happy certain percent neighbor group
Happy agent stay unhappy agent move free location
Schelling found board quickly evolved strongly segregated location pattern agent happiness rule specified segregation heavily favored
Surprisingly however also found initially integrated board tipped full segregation even agent happiness rule expressed mild preference neighbor type
In section discussed model based particle method based field method
But simulation model hybrid different kind modeling method
Multiscale simulation model particular couple together modeling element different scale description
A good example would model simulates dynamic bulk matter treating material field undergoing stress strain relatively coarse level description zoom particular region material important small scale effect taking place model smaller region relatively modeling method
Such method might rely molecular dynamic quantum mechanic description matter offered treating material field
Multiscale simulation method broken serial multiscale parallel multiscale method
The traditional method serial modeling
The idea choose region simulate lower level description summarize result set parameter digestible higher level model pas part algorithm calculating higher level
Serial multiscale method effective different scale strongly coupled together
When different scale interact strongly produce observed behavior required approach simulates region simultaneously
This called parallel multiscale modeling
Parallel multiscale modeling foundation nearly ubiquitous simulation method called modeling
modelingrefers representation important physical process occur adequately resolved grid size particular simulation
Remember many simulation discretize continuous equation relatively arbitrary finite grid In study turbulence fluid example common practical strategy calculation account missing fall inside grid cell
This done adding motion characterizes transport dissipation energy feature occurs small scale captured grid
In climate science kindred discipline modeling called This refers method replacing complex physically represented simple mathematical description
This opposed flow calculated grid level accordance basic theory
It called parameterization various needed drive highly approximative algorithm compute value
Examples parameterization climate simulation include descent rate raindrop rate atmospheric radiative transfer rate cloud formation
For example average cloudiness km grid box cleanly related average humidity box
Nonetheless average humidity increase average cloudiness also could parameter linking average cloudiness average humidity inside grid box
Even though parameterizations cloud formation sophisticated basic idea well illustrated example
The use modeling method simulation important consequence understanding structure epistemology simulation
This discussed greater detail section
modelling method contrasted another kind parallel multiscale model algorithm theoretically principled motivated theory different level description
In example simulation bulk matter mentioned example algorithm driving smaller level description built
The algorithm driving smaller level actually theoretically principled higher level sense physic fundamental quantum mechanic molecular dynamic continuum mechanic
These kind multiscale model word cobble together resource theory different level description
So provide interesting example provoke thinking intertheoretic relationship challenge view inconsistent set law model
In scientific literature another large class computer simulation called Monte Carlo MC Simulations
MC simulation computer algorithm use randomness calculate property mathematical model randomness algorithm feature target model
A nice example use random algorithm calculate value π
If draw unit square piece paper inscribe circle randomly drop collection object inside square proportion object land circle would roughly equal
A computer simulation simulated procedure like would called MC simulation calculating π
Many philosopher science deviated ordinary scientific language shied away thinking MC simulation genuine simulation
Weirich offer following reasoning The Monte Carlo approach mimetic purpose It imitates deterministic system order serve surrogate investigated stead order offer alternative computation deterministic system property
This show MC simulation fit definition aptly
On hand divide philosopher ordinary language perhaps squared noting MC simulation simulate imaginary process might used calculating something relevant studying process
Suppose I modeling planetary orbit calculation I need know value π
If I MC simulation mentioned last paragraph I simulating process randomly dropping object square I modeling planetary orbit
This sense MC simulation simulation simulation system used study
However Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources point MC simulation viz
use MC technique solve stochastic dynamical equation referring physical system fact simulation system study
There three general category purpose computer simulation put
Simulations used heuristic purpose purpose predicting data generating understanding data already
Under category heuristic model simulation subdivided used communicate knowledge others used represent information
When Watson Crick played tin plate wire latter first former showed result others
When army corp built model San Francisco Bay convince voting population particular intervention dangerous using kind heuristic purpose
Computer simulation used kind explore feature possible representational structure communicate knowledge others
For example computer simulation natural process bacterial reproduction tectonic shifting chemical reaction evolution used classroom setting help student visualize hidden structure phenomenon process impractical impossible costly illustrate wet laboratory setting
Another broad class purpose computer simulation put telling u expect system real world behave particular set circumstance
Loosely speaking computer simulation used prediction
We use model predict future retrodict past use make precise prediction loose general one
With regard relative precision prediction make simulation slightly finegrained taxonomy
There Point prediction Where planet Mars October
b Qualitative global systemic prediction Is orbit planet stable
What scaling law emerges kind system
What fractal dimension attractor system kind
c Range prediction It likely global mean surface temperature increase degree C year highly likely sea level rise least two foot implausible thermohaline shut next year
Finally simulation used understand system behavior
If already data telling u system behaves use computer simulation answer question event could possibly occurred event actually occur
When thinking topic next section epistemology computer simulation also keep mind procedure needed sanction result simulation often depend large part kind purpose purpose simulation put
As computer simulation method gained importance discipline issue trustworthiness generating new knowledge grown especially simulation expected counted epistemic peer experiment traditional analytic theoretical method
The relevant question always whether result particular computer simulation accurate enough intended purpose
If simulation used weather predict variable interested degree accuracy sufficient meet need consumer
If simulation atmosphere Midwestern plain used structure severe thunderstorm confidence structure one play explanatory role account storm sometimes split two sometimes form depicted accurately enough support confidence explanation
If simulation used engineering design prediction made simulation reliable enough sanction particular choice design parameter sanction belief particular design airplane wing function
Assuming answer question sometimes yes
kind inference least sometimes justified central philosophical question justifies
More generally claim simulation good enough intended purpose evaluated
These central question epistemology computer simulation EOCS
Given confirmation theory one traditional topic philosophy science might seem obvious latter would resource begin approach question
Winsberg however argued come topic related credentialing knowledge claim philosophy science traditionally concerned justification theory application
Most simulation hand extent make use theory tends make use theory
EOCS word rarely testing basic theory may go simulation often establishing credibility hypothesis part result application theory
Winsberg argued unlike epistemological issue take center stage traditional confirmation theory adequate EOCS must meet three condition
In particular must take account fact knowledge produced computer simulation result inference

EOCS must reflect fact large number case accepted scientific theory starting point construction computer simulation model play important role justification inference simulation result conclusion target system
The word downward meant signal fact unlike scientific inference traditionally interested philosopher move observation instance theory inference drawn part high theory particular feature phenomenon

EOCS must take account simulation result nevertheless typically depend theory many model ingredient resource well including parameterizations discussed numerical solution method mathematical trick approximation idealization outright fiction ad hoc assumption function library compiler computer hardware perhaps importantly blood sweat tear much trial error

EOCS must take account autonomy knowledge produced simulation sense knowledge produced simulation sanctioned entirely comparison observation
Simulations usually employed study phenomenon data sparse
In circumstance simulation meant replace experiment observation source data world relevant experiment observation reach principled practical ethical reason
Parker forthcoming made point usefulness condition somewhat compromised fact overly focused simulation physical science discipline simulation
This seems correct
In social behavioral science discipline simulation see norm model built absence established quantitative theory EOCS probably ought characterized term
For instance social scientist use simulation pursue methodology social phenomenon example observed pattern like segregation explained accounted generating similar looking phenomenon simulation Epstein Axtell Epstein
But raise sort epistemological question
What exactly accomplished kind knowledge acquired observed social phenomenon le reproduced simulation
Does count explanation phenomenon
A possible explanation
see
It also fair say Parker forthcoming condition outlined pay insufficient attention various differing purpose simulation used discussed
If using simulation make detailed quantitative prediction future behavior target system epistemology inference might require stringent standard involved inference made general qualitative behavior whole class system
Indeed also fair say much work could done classifying kind purpose computer simulation put constraint purpose place structure epistemology
Frigg Reiss argued none three condition new computer simulation
They argued ordinary paper pencil modeling incorporate feature
Indeed argued computer simulation could possibly raise new epistemological issue epistemological issue could cleanly divided question appropriateness model underlying simulation issue identical epistemological issue arise ordinary modeling question correctness solution model equation delivered simulation mathematical question one related epistemology science
On first point Winsberg replied simultaneous confluence three feature new simulation
We return second point section Some work EOCS developed analogy computer simulation order draw recent work epistemology experiment particularly work Allan Franklin
see entry
In work epistemology experiment Alan Franklin identified number strategy experimenter use increase rational confidence result
Weissart Parker argued various form analogy strategy number strategy available simulationists sanction result
The detailed analysis relationship found Parker also us analogy highlight weakness current approach simulation model evaluation
Winsberg also make use Ian Hacking work philosophy experiment
One central insight experiment captured slogan experiment life
Hacking intended convey two thing slogan
The first reaction unstable picture science come example Kuhn
Hacking suggests experimental result remain stable even face dramatic change part science
The second related point intended convey experiment organic develop change yet retain certain development make u talk repeating replicating experiment
Some technique simulationists use construct model get credentialed much way Hacking say instrument experimental procedure method credential develop extended period time become deeply
In Hacking language technique set assumption simulationists use become
Perhaps better expression would carry credential
This provides response problem posed understanding simulation could viable epistemology despite motley autonomous nature inference
Drawing inspiration another philosopher experiment Mayo Parker suggests remedy shortcoming current approach simulation model evaluation
In work Parker suggests Mayo approach understanding traditional make use notion severe test shed light epistemology simulation
The central question epistemology simulation perspective becomes What warrant taking computer simulation severe test hypothesis natural world
That warrant concluding simulation would unlikely give result fact gave hypothesis interest false
Parker belief much pass simulation model evaluation lack rigor structure Drawing explicitly upon Mayo work argues epistemology simulation ought instead offering account canonical error arise well strategy probing presence
Practitioners simulation particularly engineering context weapon testing climate science tend conceptualize EOCS term
said process determining whether output simulation approximates true solution differential equation original model
hand said process determining whether chosen model good enough representation system purpose simulation
The literature verification validation engineer scientist enormous beginning receive attention philosopher
Verification divided solution verification code verification
The former verifies output approximates true solution differential equation original model
The latter verifies code written carry intended algorithm
Code verification mostly ignored philosopher science probably seen problem computer science empirical mistake
Part solution verification consists comparing computed output analytic solution called benchmark solution
Though method course help make case result computer simulation since simulation often used precisely analytic solution unavailable region solution space interest
Other indirect technique available important probably checking see whether rate computed output converges stable solution time spatial resolution discretization grid get finer
The principal strategy validation involves comparing model output observable data
Again course strategy limited case simulation run observable data sparse
But complex strategy employed including comparing output subsystem simulation relevant experiment Parker forthcoming Oberkampf Roy
The concept verification validation drawn criticism philosopher
Oreskes et al
article mostly critical terminology arguing validity particular property applies logical argument hence term applied model might lead overconfidence
Winsberg argued conceptual division verification validation misleading taken suggest one set method show solved equation right another set method show got right equation
He also argued misleading think epistemology simulation cleanly divided empirical part verification mathematical computer science part validation
But misleading idea often follows discussion verification validation
We find work practitioner philosopher
Here standard line practictioner Roy Verification deal mathematics address correctness numerical solution given model
Validation hand deal physic address appropriateness model reproducing experimental data
Verification thought solving chosen equation correctly validation choosing correct equation first place Roy
Some philosopher put distinction work argument philosophical novelty simulation
We first raised issue section Frigg Reiss argued simulation could epistemologically novel feature since contained two distinct component component identical epistemology ordinary modeling component entirely mathematical
We distinguish two different notion reliability answering two different question
First solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful purely mathematical question fall within class problem mentioned
So nothing new philosophical point view question indeed one number crunching
Second computational model basis simulation represent target system correctly
That simulation result externally valid
This serious question one independent ﬁrst problem one equally arises connection model involve intractable mathematics ordinary experiment Frigg Reiss
But verification validation strictly speaking cleanly separable
That method validation much weak establish validity simulation
And model equation chosen simulation straightforward sense right equation model equation would choose ideal world
We good reason think word model equation enjoy better empirical support abstract
The equation choose often reflect compromise think best describes phenomenon computational tractability
So equation chosen rarely well validated
If want understand simulation result taken credible look epistemology simulation integrated whole cleanly divided verification would look inadequate task
So one point verification validation separable activity
But point two independent entity onto activity directed model chosen discretized method discretizing
Once one recognizes equation solved sometimes chosen cancel discretization error etc
Lenhard nice example involving Arakawa operator later distinction get harder maintain
So success achieved simulation kind piecemeal adjustment model method calculation
And case hard even know mean say simulation separately verified validated
No one argued V V useful distinction rather scientist overinflate pragmatically useful distinction clean methodological dictate misrepresents messiness practice
Collaterally Frigg Reiss argument absence epistemological novelty simulation fails reason
It purely mathematical question whether solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful
At least respect question answered pragmatic matter entirely using mathematical method
And hence issue arise ordinary modeling
Working scientist sometimes describe simulation study experimental term
The connection simulation experiment probably go back far von Neumann advocating early use computer physic noted many difficult experiment conducted merely determine fact ought principle derivable theory
Once von Neumann vision became reality experiment began replaced simulation became somewhat natural view version experiment
A representative passage found popular book simulation The idea silico experiment becomes even plausible simulation study designed learn happens system result various possible intervention What would happen global climate amount carbon added atmosphere
What happen airplane wing subjected strain
How would traffic pattern change onramp added location
Philosophers consequently begun consider sense computer simulation like experiment sense differ
A number view emerged literature centered around defending criticizing two thesis
Computer simulation study literally instance experiment

The identity thesis would true good reason weak version best reason stronger version reason strongest version necessary condition believe simulation provide warrant belief hypothesis support
A consequence strongest version identity thesis true reason believe simulation confer warrant believing hypothesis
The central idea behind epistemological dependence thesis experiment canonical entity play central role warranting belief scientific hypothesis therefore degree ought think simulation also play role warranting belief depends extent identified kind experiment
One find philosopher arguing identity thesis early Humphreys Hughes
And least implicit support stronger version epistemological dependence thesis Hughes
The earliest explicit argument favor epistemological dependence thesis however Norton Suppe
According Norton Suppe simulation warrant belief precisely literally experiment
They detailed story tell sense experiment supposed work
According Norton Suppe valid simulation one certain formal relation call realization hold base model modeled physical system computer running algorithm
When proper condition met simulation used instrument probing detecting real world phenomenon
Empirical data real phenomenon produced condition experimental control
One problem story formal condition set much strict
It unlikely many real example computer simulation meet strict standard
Simulation almost always far idealizing approximating enterprise
So simulation experiment probably way Norton Suppe imagined
More generally identity thesis drawn fire quarter
Gilbert Troitzsch argued major difference experiment one controlling actual object interest example chemistry experiment chemical investigation simulation one experimenting model rather phenomenon Gilbert Troitzsch
But seem right
Many Guala Morgan Parker Winsberg pointed problem claim
If Gilbert Troitzsch mean simulationists manipulate model sense abstract object claim difficult manipulate abstract entity
If hand simply mean point fact physical object simulationists digital actual object interest clear differs ordinary experiment
It false real experiment always manipulate exactly target interest
In fact real experiment simulation complex relationship manipulated investigation one hand system target investigation
In case experiment simulation therefore take argument substance establish external validity investigation establish learned system manipulated applicable system interest
Mendel example manipulated pea plant interested learning phenomenon heritability generally
The idea biology make idea perspicuous
We experiment interested understanding organism general use gene control development genealogy
We experiment provides useful model mutation genetic inheritance
But idea limited biology
Galileo experimented inclined plane interested object fall would behave absence interfering inclined plane experiment even actually instantiate
Of course view experiment uncontested
It true quite often experimentalists infer something system distinct system interfere
However clear whether inference proper part original experiment
Peschard mount criticism along line hence seen defender Gilbert Troitzsch
Peschard argues fundamental assumption experimentation simulation manipulated system standing target confused
It confuses Peshard argues experiment She argues epistemic motivation experiment might quite proper epistemic target experiment worm
In simulation according Peschard however epistemic target never digital computer
Thus simulation distinct experiment according epistemic target opposed merely epistemic motivation distinct object manipulated
Other opponent identity thesis include Giere Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources
It clear adjudicate dispute seems revolve primarily around difference emphasis
One emphasize experiment simulation following Gilbert Troitzsch Peschard insisting experiment teach u first epistemic target secondarily allow inference behavior system
experiment worm teach u first instance worm secondarily allow u make inference genetic control generally
This would make conceptually different computer simulation thought teach u first instance behavior computer second instance storm galaxy whatever
Or one emphasize opposite way
One emphasize degree experimental target always chosen surrogate really interest
Morrison probably forceful defender emphasizing aspect similarity experiment simulation
She argues experimental practice indeed measurement practice involve kind modeling practice simulation
In case pace Peschard nothing debate maybe appeal ordinary language use scientist always compelling kind prevent u saying epistemic target storm simulation computer storm merely epistemic motivation studying computer
Be may many philosopher simulation including discussed section chosen latter way drawing attention way message lurking behind Gilbert Troitzch quoted claim paint overly simplistic picture experiment
It seem overly simplistic paint picture according experiment get world whereas situation
And picture one seems get Gilber Troitzsch quotation
Peschard sophisticated picture involving distinction epistemic target epistemic motivation go long way towards smoothing concern without pushing u territory thinking simulation experiment regard
Still despite rejecting Gilbert characterization difference simulation experiment Guala Morgan reject identity thesis
Drawing work Simon Guala argues simulation differ fundamentally experiment object manipulation experiment bear material similarity target interest simulation similarity object target merely formal
Interestingly Morgan accepts argument identity thesis seems hold version
She argues word difference experiment simulation identified Guala implies simulation epistemologically inferior real experiment intrinsically le power warrant belief hypothesis real world experiment
A defense epistemic power simulation Morgan argument could come form defense identity thesis form rejection epistemological dependency thesis
On former front seem two problem Guala argument identity thesis
The first notion material similarity weak second notion mere formal similarity vague required work
Consider example fact uncommon engineering science use simulation method study behavior system fabricated silicon
The engineer want learn property different design possibility silicon device develops computational model device run simulation behavior digital computer
There deep material similarity material cause work central processor computer silicon device studied
On Gaula line reasoning mark example real experiment seems wrong
The peculiarity example illustrate problem rather starkly problem fact quite general two system bear material similarity difference
On flip side idea existence formal similarity two material entity could mark anything interesting conceptually confused
Given two sufficiently complex entity many way formally identical mention similar
There also way formally completely different
Now speak loosely say two thing bear formal similarity really mean best formal representation two entity formal similarity
In case appear good ground rejecting Gilbert Troitzsch Morgan Guala ground distinguishing experiment simulation
Returning defense epistemic power simulation also ground rejecting epistemological dependence thesis
As Parker point experiment simulation relevant similarity computer simulation target system matter
When relevant background knowledge place simulation provide reliable knowledge system experiment
A computer simulation solar system based sophisticated model celestial dynamic produce better representation planet orbit experiment
Paul Humphreys argued computer simulation profound implication understanding structure theory argues reveal inadequacy semantic syntactic view scientific theory
This claim drawn sharp fire Roman Frigg Julian Reiss
Frigg Reiss argue whether model admits analytic solution bearing relates world
They use example double pendulum show
Whether pendulum inner fulcrum held fixed fact determine whether relevant model analytically solvable bearing semantics element model
From conclude semantics model relates world unaffected whether model analytically solvable
This responsive however charitable reading Humphreys pointing
The syntactic semantic view theory account abstract scientific representation relate world
More particularly story relation particular model world rather relation world role model played relation
They also story lot say philosophically interesting action come scientific theorizing
The syntactic view suggested scientific practice could adequately rationally reconstructed thinking theory axiomatic system importantly logical deduction useful regulative ideal thinking inference theory world drawn
The syntactic view also omission made fairly clear modeling played anything role science
This feature syntactic view theory Frederick Suppe one ardent critic often railed
Theories nothing model theory could compared world without important role modeling play
The semantic view theory hand emphasize important role model also urged theory entity
It urged philosopher distracted contingency particular form linguistic expression theory might found say particular textbook
Computer simulation however seem illustrate theme misguided
It profoundly wrong think logical deduction right tool rationally reconstructing process theory application
Computer simulation show method theory application vastly outstrip inferential power logical deduction
The space solution example available via logical deduction theory fluid microscopic compared space application explored via computer simulation
On flip side computer simulation seem reveal Humphreys urged syntax matter
It wrong turn suggest semantic view particular linguistic form scientific theory expressed philosophically uninteresting
The syntax theory expression deep effect inference drawn kind idealization work well etc
Humphreys put point follows specific syntactic representation used often crucial solvability theory equation Humphreys
The theory fluid used emphasize point whether express theory Eulerian Lagrangian form deeply affect practice calculate affect idealization approximation calculational technique effective reliable circumstance
So epistemology computer simulation need sensitive particular syntactic formulation theory well particular formulation credentialed
Hence seem right emphasize Humphreys computer simulation revealed inadequacy syntactic semantic theory
Paul Humphreys Mark Bedau argued philosopher interested topic emergence learn great deal looking computer simulation
Philosophers interested topic consult entry contribution philosopher discussed
The connection emergence simulation perhaps best articulated Bedau
Bedau argued conception emergence must meet twin hallmark explaining whole depends part whole independent part
He argues philosopher often focus call strong emergence posit brute downward causation irreducible principle
But argues mistake
He focus instead call weak emergence reducibility whole part
Systems produce emergent property mere mechanism mechanism complex many independently interacting part
As result way figure exactly happen given specific set initial boundary condition except crawl causal web
It connection computer simulation arises
Weakly emergent property characteristic complex system nature
And also characteristic complex computer simulation way predict except let run
Weak emergence explains according Bedau computer simulation play central role science complex system
The best way understand predict real complex system behave simulate crawling web see happens
Models course involve idealization
But argued kind idealization play especially prominent role kind modeling involved computer simulation point deserve title This section discus attempt define fiction explore role computer simulation
There two different line thinking role fiction science
According one model fiction
This line thinking motivated considering role example ideal pendulum science
Scientists argued often make claim sort entity ideal pendulum period proportional length nowhere found real world hence must fictional entity
This line argument fictional entity science connect special way computer interested topic consult entry scientific representation forthcoming
Another line thinking fiction concerned question sort representation science ought regarded fictional
Here concern much ontology scientific model entity representational character various postulated model entity
Here Winsberg argued fiction special connection computer simulation
Or rather computer simulation contain element best typify might call fictional representation science even representation uniquely present simulation
He note first conception make representation contradicts reality fiction correspond ordinary use term rough map fiction
He proposes alternative definition nonfiction offered good enough guide part world fiction
But definition need refined
Take fable grasshopper ant
Although fable offer lesson world still fiction useful guide way world general sense rather specific guide way part world prima facie representational target singing grasshopper toiling ant
Nonfictions hand point certain part world guide part world
These kind fictional component model paradigmatically exemplified certain computer simulation
Two example silogen atom artificial Silogen atom appear certain nanomechanical model crack specie kind multiscale model blend quantum mechanic molecular mechanic mentioned section
The silogen containing model crack propagation silicon work describing crack using quantum mechanic region immediately surrounding crack using classical molecular dynamic
To bring together modeling framework two region boundary get treated contains silogen atom mixture property silicon hydrogen
Silogen atom fiction
They offered even good enough description atom prima facie representational target
But used overall model hoped get thing right
Thus overall model fiction one component
Artificial viscosity similar sort example
Fluids abrupt shock difficult model computational grid abrupt shock hide inside single grid cell resolved algorithm
Artificial viscosity technique pretend fluid highly shock shock becomes le abrupt blur several grid cell
Getting viscosity hence thickness shock wrong help get overall model work well Again overall model fluid fiction reliable enough guide behavior fluid
But component called artificial viscosity used reliably model shock
It incorporated larger modeling framework make larger framework reliable This account drawn two sort criticism
Toon argued definition fiction narrow
He give example historical fiction like argues fiction despite fact offered good enough guide people place event certain respect entitled take
Toon presumably support broader conception role fiction science according play particularly prominent heightened role computer simulation
Gordon Purves forthcoming argues example fiction computational model example imaginary crack elsewhere meet strict requirement discussed
Unlike Toon however also want delineate fictional modeling element one
His principal criticism criterion fictionhood term social norm Purves argues ought able settle whether piece modeling fiction absence norm
Thus want find intrinsic characterization scientific fiction
His proposal take constitutive model fiction fail characteristic Laymon called piecewise improvability PI
PI characteristic many model idealization say model becomes accurate
But silogen atom get accurate simulation silicon crack
But Purves take failure PI constitutive fiction rather merely symptomatic

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal

student received guidance
Has anyone developed widely accepted definition emergence
It seems like phenomenon obvious see way define always know emerge simple individual instruction
The concept emergence property derived empirically observation
It fundamental principle Gestalt psychology
However fall short science strictly defined since hypothesis formulated tested could support theory would yield prediction word way understand work
In sense bizarre quantum mechanic string theory
As explanatory device akin intelligent design evolution
Is emergence merely statement obvious
A solution search problem
In real way study emergence advance knowledge
Let consider emergence fully defined arena like checker chess
The rule game though number give rise huge number possibility irrelevant outright bad objective win game
However certain recurring pattern regularity among possibility greatly influence possibility winning
The regularity even name like sacrifice pin gambit
These regularity depend upon particular interaction piece
The regularity obey rule higher level
These new rule strategy exploiting regularity contradict rule game emergent sense obtainable simply summing rule applying individual piece
Similarly persistence vortex stream interaction vortex simply summing property individual water molecule
It noteworthy Maxwell used vortex rough analogy guide theory electromagnetism
Emergence regular phenomenon
A consists large number interacting individual called adapt learn interact
Examples corresponding agent parenthesis market trader ecosystem organism immune system antibody biological cell protein
Some complex current problem center All examined closely exhibit phenomenon I call inexpensive action yield desired outcome
In game lever point say pin chess immune system vaccine good example
We mostly discover lever point trial error good theory would give u principled way find
Pieces theory exist general theory deep difficult problem
Still clear young discipline much contribute understanding world
Is hurricane part emergence
I would say hurricane emergent depends interaction many component arises interaction simple sum behavior component water molecule pattern imposed flow
Again vortex stream water offer simple analogy
In philosophy workshop tried link emergence unpredictability nonlinear system like weather walking pedestrian
We utterly failed could determine exact spot new arise
Does lie eye beholder human naming something expect new quality emerging
How separate observer emergent pattern
In word bird flock wood person see make pattern
Thank
Starting clean tabletop add one grain sand time center table
When reach point pile sand exhibit small avalanche sand new grain added example phenomenon known criticality
There sharp transition pile sand pile sand transition exist
Many complex phenomenon including life sharply defined boundary studied scientifically
In case life example study produced astounding unexpected insight go far beyond interpretation
For example property DNA gene turned emergent property simply determined summing property component nucleotide
The idea pattern exist without observer bit like old philosophical conundrum Does tree falling forest make sound one hear
If define sound pattern vibration air answer yes
If define sound vibration cochlea answer
We define pattern rigorously without reference eye
Einstein equivalence
Space time intertwined
The number pi seemingly endless
What emergence say geometry universe know
Thank
The concept emergence played important role physical science though name recently
For instance property water transparency refraction etc
property individual molecule H O
They property aggregate depend upon molecule
Much story science one using selected combination element one level atom atomic physic element next level molecule chemistry
The law level constrained fully determined law previous level
Are predict emergent property Internet computer network
Might large enough collection right kind computer programmed appropriate way create emergent behavior
It seems already emergent property network positive new kind collaborative market eBay negative subroutine virus worm etc
There also simulation exhibit emergence one BOIDS simulation shown Nova segment
What insight emergence present stock market
Is possible trace back heavy volume day single stock find leader caused
As organizational performance consultant theorist I several year since reading book captured notion emergence best description corporate culture occurs
Further idea organizational culture best appreciated complex adaptive system seems appropriate experience organizational culture always seems occur inside bottom nonlinear interaction agent system etc
If true method created amplified seems antithesis traditional management theory espouses control directive extrinsically motivated alignment
Does make sense
Many esteemed colleague argue people ant fish antibody choiceful render complexity science useless lens understanding organization
My view organization must first viewed organism albeit primitive one full appreciation living complex adaptive system
Am I base
Do think study application marketing
That I could think watching wonderful piece
Thinking individual often act predictable way crowd behavior traffic jam illustrated NOVA scienceNOW program
The study complex adaptive system usually involves model wherein individual agent
firm trader even antibody organism modify behavior learning adapting strategy basis experience

Hi
Something I pondered time emergence plant community ecology assembly rule pattern vegetation respond predictably certain disturbance regime
It long time since grad school I remember modeled
My ultimate question I feeling emergence end spectrum Second Law eventually fall apart
In many case coherent plant animal community begin disorganize disturbance regime removed
Has anyone looked standpoint energy input ecological system
Thanks
This bugging long time

The great diversity tropical rain forest provides good example insect inhabit single tree
My early research used computer program called solve difficult problem mimicking role recombination selection evolution
The execution program nothing hidden create quite complex solution
As Samuel program I describe book result outdistance designer
Such concrete illustration emergence give little comfort advocating intelligent design

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

In method work specified mean assigned resource complete work
The work may virtual computation element data turn scheduled onto hardware resource
A scheduler carry scheduling activity
Schedulers often implemented keep computer resource busy allow multiple user share system resource effectively achieve target
Scheduling fundamental computation intrinsic part computer system concept scheduling make possible single CPU
A scheduler may aim one many goal example maximizing total amount work completed per time unit minimizing time work becoming enabled first point begin execution resource minimizing time work becoming enabled finished case batch activity system responds hand first output user case interactive activity maximizing equal CPU time process generally appropriate time according priority workload process
In practice goal often conflict
throughput versus latency thus scheduler implement suitable compromise
Preference measured one concern mentioned depending upon user need objective
In environment industry example scheduler also must ensure process meet crucial keeping system stable
Scheduled task also distributed remote device across network administrative back end
The scheduler operating system module selects next job admitted system next process run
Operating system may feature three distinct scheduler type also known admission scheduler scheduler
The name suggest relative frequency function performed
The process scheduler part operating system decides process run certain point time
It usually ability pause running process move back running queue start new process scheduler known otherwise
The decides job process admitted ready queue main memory attempt made execute program admission set currently executing process either authorized delayed scheduler
Thus scheduler dictate process run system degree concurrency supported one time whether many process executed concurrently split process handled
The scheduler responsible controlling degree multiprogramming
In general process described either
An process one spends time spends computation
A process contrast generates request infrequently using time computation
It important scheduler selects good process mix process
If process ready queue almost always empty scheduler little
On hand process waiting queue almost always empty device go unused system unbalanced
The system best performance thus combination process
In modern operating system used make sure process get enough CPU time finish task
scheduling also important system system
For example interacting process often required prevent blocking due waiting
In case software typically used assist function addition underlying admission scheduling support operating system
The temporarily remove process main memory place secondary memory vice versa commonly referred swapping swapping also incorrectly paging
The scheduler may decide swap process active time process low priority process frequently process taking large amount memory order free main memory process swapping process back later memory available process unblocked longer waiting resource
Stallings Stallings In many system today support mapping virtual address space secondary storage swap file scheduler may actually perform role scheduler treating binary swapped process upon execution
In way segment binary required swapped demand lazy loaded
Stallings The also known decides ready process executed allocated CPU clock interrupt operating another form
Thus scheduler make scheduling decision much frequently scheduler scheduling decision minimum made every time slice short
This scheduler implying capable forcibly removing process CPU decides allocate CPU another process also known voluntary case scheduler unable force process CPU
A preemptive scheduler relies upon invokes run implement scheduling function
Another component involved function dispatcher module give control CPU process selected scheduler
It receives control kernel mode result interrupt system call
The function dispatcher involve following The dispatcher fast possible since invoked every process switch
During context switch processor virtually idle fraction time thus unnecessary context switch avoided
The time take dispatcher stop one process start another known
Scheduling discipline algorithm used distributing resource among party simultaneously asynchronously request
Scheduling discipline used handle packet traffic well share among disk drive printer embedded system etc
The main purpose scheduling algorithm minimize ensure fairness amongst party utilizing resource
Scheduling deal problem deciding outstanding request allocated resource
There many different scheduling algorithm
In section introduce several
In notion used alternative queuing data packet
The simplest scheduling algorithm scheduling algorithm scheduling
If differentiated guaranteed offered opposed communication may utilized
In advanced packet radio wireless network Downlink Packet Access cellular system may used take advantage
If channel condition favourable may increased
In even advanced system scheduling combined assigning component user best utilize
also known FCFS simplest scheduling algorithm
FIFO simply queue process order arrive ready queue
This commonly used example illustrated section
Earliest deadline first EDF dynamic scheduling algorithm used operating system place process priority queue
Whenever scheduling event occurs task finish new task released etc
queue searched process closest deadline next scheduled execution
Similar SJF
With strategy scheduler arranges process least estimated processing time remaining next queue
This requires advanced knowledge estimation time required process complete
The operating system assigns fixed priority rank every process scheduler arranges process ready queue order priority
process get interrupted incoming process
The scheduler assigns fixed time unit per process cycle
If process completes within get terminated otherwise rescheduled giving chance process
This used situation process easily divided different group
For example common division made foreground interactive process background batch process
These two type process different requirement may different scheduling need
It useful shared memory problem
A scheduler always try keep scheduled resource busy submitted job ready scheduled
In contrast conserving scheduler scheduler case may leave scheduled resource idle despite presence job ready scheduled
There several scheduling problem goal decide job go station time total minimized A common method embedded system schedule job manually
This example done fashion
Sometimes kernel divided three part Manual scheduling preemptive interrupt level
Exact method scheduling job often proprietary
When designing operating system programmer must consider scheduling algorithm perform best use system going see
There universal best scheduling algorithm many operating system use extended combination scheduling algorithm
For example us combination preemptive scheduling first first algorithm
In system thread dynamically increase decrease priority depending serviced already waiting extensively
Every priority level represented queue among thread among one
In sense response time short thread short critical system thread get completed quickly
Since thread use one time unit queue starvation problem longer thread
The algorithm used may simple process given equal time instance m usually m m cycling list
So process A executes m process B process C back process A
More advanced algorithm take account process priority importance process
This allows process use time process
The kernel always us whatever resource need ensure proper functioning system said infinite priority
In symmetric multiprocessing system considered increase overall system performance even may cause process run slowly
This generally improves performance reducing
IBM available three different scheduler
The difference variant often considered three different operating system Later virtual storage version MVS added feature scheduler schedule processor resource according elaborate scheme defined installation
Very early Microsoft Windows system feature scheduler
used scheduler meaning interrupt program
It relied program end tell OS need processor could move another process
This usually called cooperative multitasking
Windows introduced rudimentary preemptive scheduler however legacy support opted let bit application run without preemption
operating system use multilevel feedback queue
priority level defined priority normal priority priority soft priority requiring privilege assign
reserved Operating System
Users select priority assign running application Task Manager application thread management APIs
The kernel may change priority level thread depending CPU usage whether interactive
accepts responds input human raising priority interactive bounded process lowering CPU bound process increase responsiveness interactive application
The scheduler modified use modern processor keep track exactly many CPU cycle thread executed rather using interrupt routine
Vista also us priority scheduler queue disk defragmenters program interfere foreground operation
Mac OS us cooperative scheduling thread one process control multiple cooperative thread also provides preemptive scheduling multiprocessing task
The kernel schedule multiprocessing task using preemptive scheduling algorithm
All Process Manager process run within special multiprocessing task called blue task
Those process scheduled cooperatively using algorithm process yield control processor another process explicitly calling
Each process copy schedule process thread cooperatively thread yield control processor another thread calling
macOS us multilevel feedback queue four priority band thread normal system high priority kernel mode
Threads scheduled preemptively macOS also support cooperatively scheduled thread implementation Thread Manager
In AIX Version three possible value thread scheduling policy Threads primarily interest application currently consist several asynchronous process
These application might impose lighter load system converted multithreaded structure
AIX implement following scheduling policy FIFO round robin fair round robin
The FIFO policy three different implementation FIFO
The round robin policy named AIX fair round robin called
In priority level ranging used reserved task considered task level
For task time quantum switching process approximately m nice task approximately m
The scheduler ran ready process letting highest priority process go first run time slice placed expired queue
When active queue empty expired queue become active queue vice versa
However enterprise replaced scheduler backport maintained Linux Kernel series Linux kernel used distribution
In version kernel used developed many kernel developer Linux development
For many kernel time frame developed patch set improved interactivity scheduler even replaced scheduler
Con Kolivas work significantly implementation named Rotating Staircase Deadline inspired Ingo Molnár develop replacement earlier crediting Kolivas announcement
CFS first implementation fair queuing widely used operating system
The CFS us classic scheduling algorithm called originally invented
Fair queuing previously applied CPU scheduling name
The fair queuing CFS scheduler scheduling complexity O N N number task
Choosing task done constant time reinserting task run requires O log N operation implemented
The BFS also created Con Kolivas alternative CFS
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
reserved interrupt top half kernel user thread user thread idle user thread
Also like Linux us active queue setup also idle queue
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
reserved thread default policy user thread entered kernel thread user thread policy
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
Priorities reserved thread system thread thread low priority interrupt
Unlike Linux process done using time quantum given new priority put back queue
Solaris introduced two new scheduling class namely fixed priority class fair share class
The thread fixed priority priority range class priority dynamically adjusted
The fair scheduling class us CPU prioritize thread scheduling decision
CPU share indicate entitlement CPU resource
They allocated set process collectively known project

Priority scheduling method scheduling process based priority
In method scheduler chooses task work per priority different type scheduling example simple round robin
Priority scheduling involves priority assignment every process process higher priority carried first whereas task equal priority carried FCFS round robin basis
An example algorithm SJF algorithm
Priorities either dynamic static
Static priority allocated creation whereas dynamic priority assigned depending behavior process system
To illustrate scheduler could favor intensive task let expensive request issued soon possible
Priorities may defined internally externally
Internally defined priority make use measurable quantity calculate priority given process
In contrast external priority defined using criterion beyond operating system OS include significance process type well sum resource utilized computer use user preference commerce factor like politics etc
Priority scheduling either following Indefinite blocking otherwise called starvation one major issue concerning priority scheduling algorithm
It state process ready executed face long wait getting assigned CPU
It often possible priority scheduling algorithm make process wait indefinitely
For example intensely loaded system number higher priority process process may never get CPU execution
A remedy starvation aging technique used gradually increase priority process wait long period system
Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

In problem encountered perpetually denied necessary process work
Starvation may caused error scheduling algorithm also caused intentionally caused via
The impossibility starvation concurrent algorithm called instance one two requirement mutual exclusion algorithm correctness
The name finite bypass mean process concurrent part algorithm bypassed finite number time allowed access
Starvation usually caused overly simplistic
For example poorly designed system always switch first two task third never get run third task starved
The scheduling algorithm part supposed allocate resource equitably algorithm allocate resource process perpetually lack necessary resource
Many operating system scheduler employ concept process priority
A high priority process A run low priority process B
If high priority process process A never block low priority process B system never experience starvation
If even higher priority process X dependent result process B process X might never finish even though important process system
This condition called
Modern scheduling algorithm normally contain code guarantee process receive minimum amount important resource often CPU time order prevent process subjected starvation
In computer network especially wireless network may suffer scheduling starvation
An example
Starvation similar cause process freeze
Two process become deadlocked nothing waiting resource occupied another program set
On hand process starvation waiting resource continuously given process
stronger guarantee absence deadlock mutual exclusion algorithm must choose let one two process pick one arbitrarily
A possible solution starvation use scheduling algorithm priority queue also us technique
Aging technique gradually increasing priority process wait system long time

I total loss accomplish following scenario Access Say I two table Users Tasks
I like display form show particular user task sorted Priority integer
The priority fixed I need make sure two task user priority
I clue accomplish using Access
What kind query I need build form
Ideally I like two button form Task Priority
Any suggestion would greatly appreciated
I averse using VBA take I feeling elegant solution

learn share knowledge build career
From I read past encouraged change priority window application programmatically never change
What process priority setting compared Normal
A realtime priority thread never timer interrupt run higher priority thread system
As CPU bound realtime priority thread totally ruin machine
Creating realtime priority thread requires privilege done administrative user
For Vista beyond one option application require run realtime priority use MMCSS let manage thread priority
The MMCSS prevent application using much CPU time worry tanking machine
Simply Real Time priority class higher High priority class
I think much
Oh yeah put thread Real Time class
Windows sometimes boost priority thread various reason wo boost priority thread another priority class
It also wo boost priority thread priority class
So High priority thread wo get automatic temporary boost Real Time priority class
Russinovich Inside Windows chapter Windows handle priority great resource learning work Note absolutely problem thread priority normal Windows system necessarily special process running dedicatd machine
I imagine multimedia driver process might need thread priority
However thread require much CPU blocking time order normal system event get processing
It would highest available priority setting would usually used box dedicated running specific program
It actually high enough could cause starvation keyboard mouse thread extent become unresponsive
So basicly ask use highest priority available process
Therefore different one step greater Normal two step greater
Similarly also thread priority level
The process priority raise lower effective thread priority process therefore considered priority
So process Since supposed reserved application absolutely must running process special security privilege protect haphazard use
This defined security policy
In use Vista Multimedia Class Scheduler proper way achieve operation OS
It work part though perfect since OS designed operation
Microsoft considers priority dangerous rightly
No application use except specialized circumstance even try limit use temporary need
Once Windows learns program us higher normal priority seems like limit priority process
Setting priority IDLE REALTIME NOT change CPU usage
I found My AMD CPU I drop one CPUs ot like LAST one CPU usage MAX OUT last CPU remains idle
The processor speed increase Quad AMD
Use Task select Right Click Set Affinity Click last processor
The CPU usage increase MAX remaining processor Frame count processing video increase
It basically everything else
A keyboard le priority real time process
This mean process taken account faster keyboard ca handle keyboard slowed
Like answer real time give program utmost priority class
Nothing processed program processed
On pentium machine I set minecraft real time lot since increase game performance lot system seems completely stable
realtime bad seems set program affinity specific core core let everything else able run case real time set program get hung set priority real time

In traditionally either kind variable
The latter may allow element mutated length changed may fixed creation
A string generally understood often implemented store sequence element typically character using
A string may also denote general sequence data type structure
Depending programming language precise data type used declared string may either cause storage memory statically allocated predetermined maximum length employ allow hold variable number element
When string appears literally known anonymous string
In used string finite sequence chosen called
Let Σ symbol alternatively called character called
No assumption made nature symbol
A Σ finite symbol Σ
For example Σ string Σ
The string number symbol length sequence often denoted
The unique string Σ length denoted
The set string Σ length denoted Σ
For example Σ Σ
Note Σ ε alphabet Σ
The set string Σ length Σ denoted Σ
In term Σ For example Σ Σ ε
Although set Σ element Σ string finite length
A set string Σ
Σ called Σ
For example Σ set string even number zero ε formal language important Σ
For two string Σ concatenation defined sequence symbol followed sequence character denoted
For example Σ b z
String concatenation operation
The empty string ε serf string ε ε
Therefore set Σ concatenation operation form generated Σ
In addition length function defines Σ integer function
A string said exist possibly empty string
The substring defines Σ empty string
A string said exists string
If nonempty said prefix
Symmetrically string said exists string
If nonempty said suffix
Suffixes prefix substring
Both relation prefix suffix
A string said rotation
For example Σ string rotation u v
The reverse string string symbol reverse order
For example abc b c symbol alphabet reverse cba
A string reverse madam called also includes empty string string length
It often useful define set string
If alphabet Σ cf
one define total order Σ called
For example Σ lexicographical order Σ includes relationship ε
The lexicographical order alphabetical order nontrivial alphabet even alphabetical order
See alternative string ordering preserve
A number additional operation string commonly occur formal theory
These given article
Strings admit following interpretation node graph The natural topology set string string discrete topology natural topology set infinite string viewing set infinite string set finite string
This construction used construction yield topology
string representation topology found normalizing according
A datatype modeled idea formal string
Strings important useful datatype implemented nearly every
In language available others
The programming language allows string usually quoted way represent instance string datatype called
Although formal string arbitrary finite length length string real language often constrained artificial maximum
In general two type string datatypes fixed maximum length determined compile time use amount memory whether maximum needed whose length arbitrarily fixed use varying amount memory depending actual requirement
Most string modern string
Of course even string limited length number bit available pointer size available
The string length stored separate integer may put artificial limit length implicitly termination character usually character value bit zero
See also
String datatypes historically allocated one byte per character although exact character set varied region character encoding similar enough programmer could often get away ignoring since character program treated specially period space comma place encoding program would encounter
These character set typically based
If text one encoding displayed system using different encoding text often though often somewhat readable computer user learned read mangled text
language known collectively need far character limit one byte encoding reasonable representation
The normal solution involved keeping representation ASCII using representation CJK
Use existing code led problem matching cutting string severity depended character encoding designed
Some encoding family guarantee byte value ASCII range represent ASCII character making encoding safe system use character field separator
Other encoding make guarantee making matching byte code unsafe
These encoding also locating character boundary required backing start string pasting two string together could result corruption second string
simplified picture somewhat
Most programming language datatype Unicode string
Unicode preferred byte stream format designed problem described older multibyte encoding
require programmer know code unit different character main difficulty currently incorrectly designed APIs attempt hide difference make character due composing code
Some language like implement string used datatype exception rule
Some language normally allow content string changed created termed string
In language value fixed new string must created alteration made termed string
Strings typically implemented byte character code unit order allow fast access individual unit character fixed length
A language implement instead
Some language avoid implementing dedicated string datatype instead adopting convention representing string list character code
Representations string depend heavily choice character repertoire method character encoding
Older string implementation designed work repertoire encoding defined ASCII recent extension like series
Modern implementation often use extensive repertoire defined Unicode along variety complex encoding
The term usually indicates string byte rather string readable character string bit
Byte string often imply byte take value data stored meaning value interpreted termination value
Most string implementation similar entry storing corresponding character
The principal difference certain encoding single logical character may take one entry array
This happens example single code code point take anywhere one four byte single character take arbitrary number code
In case logical length string number character differs physical length array number byte use
avoids first part problem
The length string stored implicitly using special terminating character often NUL bit zero convention used perpetuated popular
Hence representation commonly referred
This representation string take space terminator thus
In terminated string terminating code allowable character string
Strings field limitation also store arbitrary
An example stored along modern representation The length string example character occupies byte
Characters terminator form part representation may either part data garbage
Strings form sometimes called original directive used declare
Using special byte null terminating string historically appeared hardware software though sometimes value also printing character
used many assembler system used system character value zero used since string delimiter BASIC language
Somewhat similar data processing machine like used special bit delimit string left operation would start right
This bit clear part string
This meant IBM word almost ever thought use feature override assignment seventh bit example handle ASCII code
Early microcomputer software relied upon fact ASCII code use bit set indicate end string
It must reset prior output
The length string also stored explicitly example prefixing string length byte value convention used many dialect consequence people call string
Storing string length byte limit maximum string length
To avoid limitation improved implementation use store string length
When field cover string limited
If length bounded encoded constant space typically machine word thus leading taking space number character word ASCII machine machine etc
If length bounded encoding length take log space see string encoding string length log space
In latter case field fixed length therefore actual string data need moved string grows length field need increased
Here Pascal string stored buffer along ASCII representation Many language including one implement string internal structure like However since implementation usually string must accessed modified member function
pointer dynamically allocated memory area might expanded needed
See also
Both character termination length code limit string For example C character array contain null NUL character handled directly C string library function Strings using length code limited maximum value length code
Both limitation overcome clever programming
It possible create data structure function manipulate problem associated character termination principle overcome length code bound
It also possible optimize string represented using technique replacing repeated character character value length
While representation common others possible
Using make certain string operation insertion deletion concatenation efficient
The core data structure one manages string sequence character represents current state file edited
While state could stored single long consecutive array character typical text editor instead us alternative representation sequence data line make certain string operation insertion deletion undoing previous edits efficient
The differing memory layout storage requirement string affect security program accessing string data
String representation requiring terminating character commonly susceptible problem terminating character present caused coding error deliberately altering data
String representation adopting separate length field also susceptible length manipulated
In case program code accessing string data requires ensure inadvertently access change data outside string memory limit
String data frequently obtained program
As responsibility program validate string ensure represents expected format
Performing limited validation cause program vulnerable attack
Sometimes string need embedded inside text file intended consumption machine
This needed example source code programming language configuration file
In case NUL character work well terminator since normally invisible difficult input via keyboard
Storing string length would also inconvenient manual computation tracking length tedious
Two common representation While character string common us string string computer science may refer generically sequence homogeneously typed data
A example may used represent retrieved communication medium
This data may may represented datatype depending need application desire programmer capability programming language used
If programming language string implementation data corruption may ensue
C programmer draw sharp distinction string aka string character definition always null terminated byte string pseudo string may stored array often null terminated
Using function byte string often seems work later lead
There many processing string various
Some category algorithm include Advanced string algorithm often employ complex mechanism data structure among
The name coined computer scientist issue algorithm data structure used string processing
Character string useful datatype several language designed order make string processing application easy write
Examples include following language Many utility perform simple string manipulation used easily program powerful string processing algorithm
Files finite stream may viewed string
Some like use string hold command interpreted
Recent including Perl Ruby Tcl employ facilitate text operation
Perl particularly noted regular expression use many language application implement
Some language Perl Ruby support permit arbitrary expression evaluated included string literal

standard way handle text use
Any given Java mean changed
A
Whenever must manipulated change require creation new turn involves creation new array character copying original array
This happens even original value intermediate used manipulation kept
Java provides two alternate class string manipulation called
Both like array hold character
They however mutable state altered
Their array character necessarily completely filled opposed String whose array always exact required length content
Thus capability add remove change state without creating new object without creation new array array copying
The exception array longer suitable length hold content case rarely happens default Dynamic memory allocation provided JVM
In case required create new array copy content
For reason Java would handle expression like like Generally String string handling
However necessarily case since StringBuffer required recreate character array run space
Theoretically possible happen number time new String would required although unlikely programmer provide length hint prevent
Either way effect noticeable modern desktop computer
As well shortcoming array inherent
In order insert remove character arbitrary position whole section array must moved
The method attractive environment low processing power take ability using much memory likely also premium environment
This point however trivial considering space required creating many instance Strings order process

The software industry put much effort reducing bug count
These include Bugs usually appear programmer make
Various innovation designed make bug le likely easier spot
Some typo especially symbol allow program operate incorrectly others missing symbol misspelled name may prevent program operating
Compiled language reveal typo source code compiled
Several scheme assist managing programmer activity fewer bug produced
address software design issue well applies many technique prevent defect
For example formal state exact behavior program design bug may eliminated
Unfortunately formal specification impractical anything shortest program problem
involves writing test every function unit program perform
In unit test written code code considered complete test complete successfully
involves frequent software release relatively small change
Defects revealed user feedback
Open source development allows anyone examine source code
A school thought popularized say popular chance bug software given enough eyeball bug shallow
This assertion disputed however computer security specialist wrote easy hide vulnerability complex little understood undocumented source code even people reviewing code mean qualified
An example actually happening accidentally
include feature help prevent bug static restricted
For example programmer writes pseudocode although may syntactically correct code fails
Compiled language catch without run program
Interpreted language catch error runtime
Some language deliberate exclude feature easily lead bug expense slower performance general principle almost always better write simpler slower code inscrutable code run slightly faster especially considering substantial
For example support arithmetic implementation language often runtime array least debugging build
Tools help developer inspecting program text beyond compiler capability spot potential problem
Although general problem finding programming error given specification solvable see tool exploit fact human programmer tend make certain kind simple mistake often writing software
Tools monitor performance software running either specifically find problem give assurance correct working may embedded code explicitly perhaps simple statement saying provided tool

people whose primary task find bug write code support testing
On project resource may spent testing developing program
Measurements testing provide estimate number likely bug remaining becomes reliable longer product tested developed
Finding fixing bug major part
early computing pioneer described realization late much rest life would spent finding mistake program
Usually difficult part debugging finding bug
Once found correcting usually relatively easy
Programs known help programmer locate bug executing code line line watching variable value feature observe program behavior
Without debugger code may added message value may written console window log file trace program execution show value
However even aid debugger locating bug something art
It uncommon bug one section program cause failure completely different section thus making especially difficult track example error graphic routine causing file routine fail apparently unrelated part system
Sometimes bug isolated flaw represents error thinking planning part programmer
Such require section program overhauled rewritten
As part stepping code imagining transcribing execution process may often find error without ever reproducing bug
More typically first step locating bug reproduce reliably

Some software publisher use qualified severity critical high low blocker trivial
The severity bug may separate category priority fixing two may quantified managed separately
control bug fall list planned change
The priority decided software producer
Priorities sometimes numerical sometimes named critical high low deferred note may similar even identical severity rating looking different software producer
For example priority bug may always fixed next release bug may never fixed
Industry practice employ inverted scale highest priority low number larger number indicate lower priority
It common practice release software known bug
Most big software project maintain two list known bug known software team told user
The second list informs user bug fixed specific release may offered
Releases different kind
Bugs sufficiently high priority may warrant special release part code containing module fix
These known
Most release include mixture behavior change multiple bug fix
Releases emphasize bug fix known release
Releases emphasize feature known major release often name distinguish new feature old
Reasons software publisher opts patch even fix particular bug include In software development project mistake fault may introduced stage
Bugs arise oversight misunderstanding made software team specification design coding data entry documentation
For example relatively simple program alphabetize list word design might fail consider happen word contains
Or converting abstract design code coder might inadvertently create fail sort last word list
Errors may simple typing error intended
Another category bug called may occur program multiple component executing time
If component interact different order developer intended could interfere stop program completing task
These bug may difficult detect anticipate since may occur every execution program
Conceptual error developer misunderstanding software must

Missing measure Should severity autism defined intensity person symptom ability function
Just last week parent young boy I diagnosed autism asked How severe autism It first time parent child adult autism posed question
It important one family make sense child diagnosis available treatment option also scientific community
How define autism severity good measure
But measure autism severity need come acceptable definition
A literature search article include term autism severity yield result
But definition severity vary among study widely method
Severity often defined term language ability intellectual functioning presence problematic behavior aggression contribute significantly individual ability function social academic employment situation
However necessarily core feature autism currently conceptualize disorder
If define severity autism degree intensity autism need direct focus core feature namely social communicative impairment restricted interest behavior
But even focus restricted core domain autism remains unclear severity defined relation intensity symptom individual ability function
And severity defined intensity symptom measured total number symptom core domain degree symptom expressed domain combination degree number symptom carrying weight others
There challenge approach
It easy see child mild symptom core autism domain may seem le severely impaired child key deficit wholly prevent reciprocal social interaction
If severity defined based individual ability function common impairment necessarily core feature autism cognitive deficit challenging behavior need considered factor major impact functioning
Ultimately severe autism
Is child presenting every textbook symptom linked autism one core symptom well associated challenging behavior significantly impact quality life
Clinicians researcher working answering question several way
As scientist I driven quantify define severity autism
And although I strongly believe measure severity scientific utility helping elucidate neurobiological mechanism underlying disorder I wonder single tool ever successfully measure severity autism
Researchers use several approach quantify autism severity including rating scale Childhood Autism Rating Scale Gilliam Autism Rating Scale Autism Behavior Checklist questionnaire measuring autism trait behavior Autism Spectrum Quotient Social Responsiveness Scale SRS Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory Autism Diagnostic Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS measure cognitive level adaptive ability language ability statistically derived combination
These approach instrument incredibly valuable characterizing autism however highlighted study limitation approach
For example many rating scale correlate strongly individual intelligence quotient IQ reduces focus autism core symptom
However SRS le impacted IQ focus primarily social communication include direct observation child
Summary score often used severity metric coreautism symptom developed measure severity
For example higher score generally indicate greater impairment child administered portion test restricting utility communication domain
Scores also vary based child IQ age
Similar complication arise researcher use ADOS summary score
These influenced age language level determine version module test administered limiting ability ADOS generalize across individual
The newest approach calibrated severity score based raw ADOS score attempt provide standardized metric control language ability age determining autism severity
It provides promising approach address many drawback measure
But still early determine usefulness clinical setting effective providing insight underlying genetic neurobiological feature autism
Despite untested status I believe measure calibrated severity score account range contributing factor appropriate approach take
Specifically measure control contribution age language cognitive ability incorporates objective measure observed behavior includes measure rarer behavior accurately reported caregiver acknowledges challenging behavior scale variability good psychometric property goal
These measure significantly advanced understanding autism although precise characterization severity remained elusive
This expected given fact disorder change development heterogeneous
The measure also used multiple context varying clinical research setting
It may definition autism severity measure also vary across context
Given diverse symptom child autism clear understanding feature disorder including language ability cognitive ability medical complication behavior aggression tendency wander away caregiver needed fully characterize functioning level individual
These qualifier may prove relevant parent clinician impact functioning much core autism symptom
Better knowledge related symptom interact core autism symptom critical advancing understanding autism severity adapting diagnostic clinical service accordingly
It also crucial helping define phenotype assessing treatment outcome
By contrast given underlying heterogeneity autism focus core impairment exclusion associated challenge may help pinpoint disorder pathway
When studying genetic neurobiological contribution autism quantifying autism severity based presence degree core autism symptom rather impact functioning may relevant
I confident future universal definition definition autism severity
Perhaps one based core symptom second one defined functioning maybe even third definition reflects disorder societal financial impact
In order get scientist clinician parent need understand contribution interaction associated symptom core symptom
We also need build gain made using existing measure severity consider autism severity function context define
Although severity metric help evaluate treatment progress guide planning I sure I want able answer question parent office asked last week

As one recently diagnosed ASD age le I pondered idea severity
By outward appearance I severely impaired
But I reported parent IQ tested standard deviation normal around age
Yet I stumbled school ended working series low paying dead end job
I attempted college time nearly completing computer science degree landing first entry level real job age full year past normal freshly minted college graduate Computer Science
Even struggle maintain employment daunting career trajectory flat regularly opportunity passing favor socially competent individual
This brief synopsis begs question severe impairment
Is simply surviving undiagnosed without typical autism intervention enough say I mildly autistic
Or fulfillment one potential also part measure severity
It easy question
It easy question
You wildly successful order considered able bodied
My son autistic dad obviously Aspie I certainly autistic quality
I remember struggling certain aspect school lot thing childhood make LOT sense I understand autism
But I lot core feature autism
I struggled live independently I nearing
I autistic
I disabled
Autistic trait certainly affected ability move upward many true NT temper NT inability play nice others well
It able work hour effectively bad leadership skill
In case sound like ARE able hold employment personality make difficult score promotion
That life really disability
Sorry Sunshine ability hold job year two denote success
Quality life extremely important one ablility hold meaninful job contribute society fully possible also important
Let face person stymied hold minimum wage job year leave employee accept quirk would better person counselled trained allow work better others productive therefore earn better wage pay tax take le even contribute society
Would also worth time effort educate worker quirk le offensive controllable issue blind person someone wheelchair might present
Most people would hold door open someone cane wheelchair patience someone stutter hold conversation minute
The whole point neurodiversity everyone given opportunity become person wish held back bullied mocked otherwise dismissed incomplete incapable person
son level benjamin severe twin brother andrew jr severe Also parent day I would describe son autism severe day I hardly even notice
Some day seems normal converse way something I never seen I always think THIS IS And next day want speak nonsense talk repeatedly label toy I think maybe severe I get feeling function level fluctuates school high functioning sometimes low sometimes severe
At beginning teacher labeled severe acan test
At end year said thing like severe I thought She advised summer school teacher He smart try hard day think I know make severity level
It scary I always second guess
To autism fluctuates wildly I wish I could pin point make good day high functioning

Measures categorical discrete variable consist assigning observation one number category term count proportion
The category unordered ordered see
variable representing frequency occurrence event bounded count ratio count Discretely measured response We learn evaluate mostly parametric model response
Interval variable numerical distance two value
income Measurement hierarchy Example Grades Note many variable considered either nominal ordinal depending purpose analysis
Consider major English Psychology Computer Science
This classification may considered nominal ordinal depending whether intrinsic belief better major Computer Science Psychology English
Generally speaking binary variable like ordinal nominal consideration matter
Context important
The context study relevant question interest important specifying kind variable analyze
For example Based context also decide whether variable response dependent variable explanatory independent variable
Discuss following question Course Discussion Board Here simple example contingency table
A university offer two degree program English Computer Science

In given
Local variable reference declared override variable name larger scope
In two level visibility local variable contrasted
On hand many language allow number nested level visibility private variable function constant type hidden within either nested block
Local variable fundamental generally variable local scope used avoid issue occur
Local variable may lexical dynamic though lexical static scoping far common
In lexical scoping lexical scope also called static scoping static scope variable name scope certain block scope program text block definition within block text variable name exists bound variable value outside block text variable name exist
By contrast dynamic scoping dynamic scope variable name scope certain block scope block function transitively called block except overridden another declaration block end variable name exist
Some language like allow programmer choose static dynamic scoping defining redefining variable
Examples language use dynamic scoping include shell language MirBSD Korn shell mksh local declaration
Most language provide lexically scoped local variable
In language local variable stored directly
This mean call local variable instance function given distinct
Hence variable scope declared written read without risk function outside block declared
Programming language employ semantics provide called subroutine local copy passed
In language local parameter treated local variable within subroutine
In contrast semantics allow parameter act alias value passed argument allowing subroutine modify variable outside scope
A special type local variable called available many mainstream language including allows value retained one call function another local scope
In case recursive call function also access single variable
In language static variable declared special keyword
Static local global function lifetime value remains memory life program global scope automatic local variable
This distinct usage several different meaning various language
support dynamic local variable
The keyword used define local variable used local variable
Since dynamic scoping le common today Perl documentation warns people think local
Instead keyword give temporary value global package variable last end enclosing block
However variable visible function called within block
To create local variable use operator instead
To understand work consider following code output This happens since global variable modified new local meaning inside global value restored upon leaving scope
Using case instead would printed three time since case variable would limited static scope function seen
Randal Schwartz Tom Phoenix argue operator different name like
language inspired also Perl case notation made simpler global variable name must preceded sign like local variable simply sign front name like perl scalar value front
Note Ruby provides support local variable like Perl local variable like Perl
There least one library Ruby provides variable

In storage location identified paired associated contains known unknown quantity information referred
The variable name usual way stored value addition referring variable depending context
This separation name content allows name used independently exact information represents
The identifier computer value variable may thus change course
Variables programming may directly correspond concept
The latter reference physical object storage location
The value computing variable necessarily part mathematics
Variables computer programming frequently given long name make relatively descriptive use whereas variable mathematics often terse name brevity transcription manipulation
A variable storage location may referred several different identifier situation known
Assigning value variable using one identifier change value accessed identifier
replace variable symbolic name actual location data
While variable name type location often remain fixed data stored location may changed program execution
In value generally time
In variable expression keep single value entire due requirement
In imperative language behavior exhibited named symbolic constant typically contrasted normal variable
Depending programming language variable may able store specified

Alternatively datatype may associated current value allowing single variable store anything supported programming language
An identifier referencing variable used access variable order read value alter value edit variable access permission etc
For instance variable might referenced identifier variable contain number
If variable referenced identifier well using identifier value variable altered reading value using identifier yield result
If variable referenced single identifier simply called
Otherwise speak
For instance previous example name variable question another name variable
The variable describes program text variable may used describes program execution variable meaningful value
The scope variable actually property name variable extent property variable
These confused also called property program varies point source code execution see
Further may coincide variable lifetime many case tied variable lifetime
A variable name affect
important part variable
Most language define specific variable well named entity may differ within given program
The scope variable portion program code variable name meaning variable said visible
Entrance scope typically begin variable lifetime come context exit scope typically end lifetime go context
For instance variable meaningful within certain finely within block accordingly static resolution performable
Alternatively variable resolved based global binding stack depends specific control flow
Variables accessible within certain function termed
A one indefinite scope may referred anywhere program
hand runtime aspect variable
Each variable value runtime
The extent binding portion program execution time variable continues refer value memory location
A running program may enter leave given extent many time case
Unless programming language feature variable whose extent permanently outlasts scope result whereby memory allocated variable never freed since variable would used reference deallocation purpose longer accessible
However permissible variable binding extend beyond scope occurs Lisp C execution pass back variable scope variable may used
A variable whose scope begin extent said often undefined arbitrary value accessed see since yet explicitly given particular value
A variable whose extent end scope may become deemed uninitialized since value destroyed
Variables described previous two case may said
In many language error try use value variable extent
In language may yield
Such variable may however assigned new value give new extent
For space efficiency memory space needed variable may allocated variable first used freed longer needed
A variable needed scope thus beginning variable lifetime enters scope may give space unused variable
To avoid wasting space compiler often warn programmer variable declared used
It considered good programming practice make scope variable narrow feasible different part program accidentally interact modifying variable
Doing also prevents
Common technique different section program use different make individual variable private either
Many programming language employ reserved value often named indicate invalid uninitialized variable
In language variable also meaning certain kind value stored
For example variable type prohibited storing text value
In language value variable carry type
In situation exist simultaneously A variable given type undeclared assumed universal exists compile time
Values also type checked queried runtime
Typing variable also allows resolved compile time
However different polymorphism used function call referred resolve call based value type opposed supertypes variable allowed
Variables often store simple data like integer literal string programming language allow variable store value well
Such language may also enable function
These function operate like variable represent data multiple type
For example function named may determine length list
Such function may parametric polymorphic including type variable since amount element list independent element type
The function also referred variable
For instance code segment variable named given value function called
The integer give value
In language function parameter local scope
This specific variable named referred within function though course function also variable called
The specific variable allocation representation value vary widely among programming language among implementation given language
Many language implementation allocate space whose extent last single function call whose memory automatically reclaimed function return
More generally name variable bound address particular block contiguous sequence byte memory operation variable manipulate block
common variable whose value large unknown size code compiled
Such variable reference location value instead storing value allocated pool memory called
Bound variable value
A value however abstraction idea implementation value represented stored somewhere computer memory
The program must set aside memory data object since memory finite ensure memory yielded reuse object longer needed represent variable value
Objects allocated heap must object longer needed
In language runtime environment automatically reclaims object extant variable longer refer
In language program programmer must explicitly memory later free reclaim memory
Failure lead heap depleted program run risk eventual failure exhausting available memory
When variable refers created dynamically component may indirectly accessed variable
In circumstance garbage collector analogous program feature language lack garbage collector must deal case portion memory reachable variable need reclaimed
Unlike mathematical counterpart programming variable constant commonly take name

name commonly used auxiliary variable instance variable
Some naming convention enforced language level part language syntax involve format valid identifier
In almost language variable name start digit contain whitespace character
Whether punctuation mark permitted variable name varies language language many language permit variable name forbid punctuation
In programming language specific often punctuation character known prefixed appended variable identifier indicate variable type
variable name also varies language language require use certain case naming certain entity Most modern language older language
Some language reserve certain form variable name internal use many language name beginning two underscore often fall category
However beyond basic restriction imposed language naming variable largely matter style
At level variable name used exact name chosen matter computer
Thus name variable identify rest tool programmer make program easier write understand
Using poorly chosen variable name make code difficult review name name clear often encouraged
Programmers often create adhere code style guideline offer guidance naming variable impose precise naming scheme
Shorter name faster type le descriptive longer name often make program easier read purpose variable easier understand
However extreme verbosity variable name also lead le comprehensible code

Variables act storage location data program
They way naming information later usage
Each variable example variable name use
To store information variable write command using equal sign following way Thus end program value value value

used store information referenced manipulated computer program
They also provide way labeling data descriptive name program understood clearly reader
It helpful think variable container hold information
Their sole purpose label store data memory
This data used throughout program
Naming variable known one difficult task computer programming
When naming variable think hard name
Try best make sure name assign variable accurately descriptive understandable another reader
Sometimes reader revisit program wrote month even year earlier
When assign variable use symbol
The name variable go left value want store variable go right
Here assigned value string variable
Now want reference variable
As see stored string memory use throughout program
Let try little something
Look following irb session
What value point
Take best guess type session irb find
You notice value remains
This show variable point value memory deeply linked
If confusing worry plenty exercise complete make information clear obvious
And doubt always try irb
Up able assign data variable within program
However wild want people able interact program interesting way
In order allow user store information variable well
Then decide like data
One way get information user call method
stand get string lot fun
When use program wait user type information press enter key
Let try
Type example irb get feel play around bit like
After code computer waited u type information
We typed Bob pressed enter program returned
The end newline character represents enter key
But want part string
We use chained get rid put string remove carriage return character end
There go
That much prettier
Now use variable please
A variable scope determines program variable available use
A variable scope defined variable initialized created
In Ruby variable scope defined
A block piece code following method invocation usually delimited either curly brace
Be aware pair imply
Now idea constitutes variable scope one rule want remember Looking code make clearer
Let say file called
What value printed screen
Try
The value
This available inner scope created allowed code value
In fact three time
Let try something else
We modify piece code
What result get running program
You gotten error tune This variable available outside method invocation block initialized
When call available within outer scope
Note key distinguishing factor deciding whether code delimited considered block thereby creates new scope variable seeing immediately follows method invocation
For example The answer yes
The reason code create new inner scope since part Ruby language method invocation
When use method invocation followed new block created
Before move aware five type variable
Constants global variable class variable instance variable local variable
While worry much topic depth yet brief description
Constants declared capitalizing every letter variable name
They used storing data never need change
While programming language allow change value assigned constant Ruby
It however throw warning letting know previous definition variable
Just mean change value
In fact
Constants declared method definition available throughout application scope
Example constant declaration Global variable declared starting variable name dollar sign
These variable available throughout entire app overriding scope boundary
Rubyists tend stay away global variable unexpected complication using
Example global variable declaration Class variable declared starting variable name two sign
These variable accessible instance class well class
When need declare variable related class instance class need value variable use class variable
Class variable must initialized class level outside method definition
They altered using class instance method definition
Example class variable declaration Instance variable declared starting variable name one sign
These variable available throughout current instance parent class
Instance variable cross scope boundary
You learn get OOP topic use instance variable know
Example instance variable declaration Local variable common variable come across obey scope boundary
These variable declared starting variable name neither well capitalizing entire variable name
Example local variable declaration In chapter talked use variable store information later use get information user
We also showed variable created equal scope variable defined change availability throughout program
Now know different type variable use let put knowledge practice exercise
Write program called asks user type name print greeting message name included
Write program called asks user old tell old year
Below output someone year old
Add another section onto print name user time
You must without explicitly writing put method time row
Hint use method something repeatedly
Modify first asks user first name save variable last name
Then output full name
Look following program What x print screen case
Do give error
Are error different
Why
The first print screen
The second throw error available created within scope block
What following error message tell
The program trying reference variable method named defined program outside scope called

A local variable C type variable declared local variable declaration beginning block variable intended local
It also occur foreach statement using statement statement using statement
The local variable declaration explicitly defines type variable declared along identifier name variable
A local variable type variable used scope extent variable within method statement block declared
It used iteration variable foreach statement exception variable clause resource variable using statement
It also used constant whose value modified within method statement block declared
An implicitly typed local variable whose type inferred compiler expression right useful dealing language integrated query LINQ return anonymous type creating custom type LINQ result set
The memory allocation local variable based type
In case local variable type like struct integer etc
entire content stored stack whereas reference typed variable stored reference portion stack content heap
An implicitly typed local variable declared without using type keyword var assigns appropriate type
For example implicitly typed local variable used foreach statement without declaring type iterate collection
A local variable referred code textual position precedes declaration statement local variable
In addition two local variable name within single block result compilation error
Multiple local variable type declared initialized single statement

In software programming language variable work like container hold number phrase important stuff used several place code
Here work several common language
In software programming variable name used hold one value
Instead repeating value multiple place code variable hold result calculation database call result database query value
Instead multiple calculation load multiple database call retrieve data variable stored computer memory used wherever needed code
For example imagine calculation assigned variable called math math Now imagine need calculation different place code
You could copy paste spot code like answer Or could use variable math like answer math When update calculation example changing update part right math variable math One change definition variable much easier searching replacing How variable used similar across programming language
Typically variable left followed equal sign followed item item assigned
Assignment value variable happens either top script example variable used widely close used possible
This help readability maintenance code
Variable identifier different across language
Here example variable handled several different programming language
int width With C programming language specify data type variable case integer int
Lines code C also end
width With Lua programming language variable name assignment brutally simple
There mark end line code
width Note dollar sign variable name width well end line
If important useful specify data type variable typically short prefix added variable name example intWidth integer arrHouseData variable contains array library data
width As Lua Python use prefix like PHP explicit line ending like C PHP
width The Rails language number way express variable based location use within code
The use double symbol example indicates class variable whose value disappears unavailable outside class contains variable
The scope class variable differs variable used language
If know programming class block code
Classes contain number different item called referenced part application rather like variable
With variable also important note As learn language learn nuance language handle variable assigned scope possible detail
All language however use variable efficient way store reuse data software application

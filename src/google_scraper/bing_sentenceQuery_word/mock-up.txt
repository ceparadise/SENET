In model design device used teaching demonstration design evaluation promotion purpose
A mockup provides least part functionality system enables testing design
used designer mainly acquire feedback user
address idea captured popular engineering You fix drafting board eraser fix later construction site sledge hammer
Mockups used virtually everywhere new product designed
Mockups used automotive device industry part product development process dimension overall impression shape tested experiment
They also used test consumer reaction
Mockups prototype cleanly distinguished mockups way designing paper computer image
A software mockup thus look like real thing useful work beyond user see
A software prototype hand look work like real thing
In many case best design prototype user interface written hardware built avoid go back make expensive change
Early layout World Wide Web site page often called
A large selection software tool available purpose
Mockups part process
Mockups often used test example
In context mockups include
They also used public display demonstration purpose prior development prototype case aircraft
Mockups used consumer good industry part product development process dimension human factor overall impression tested
Mockups commonly required designer architect end user custom furniture cabinetry
The intention often produce replica using inexpensive material order verify design
Mockups often used determine proportion piece relating various dimension piece fit piece specific space room
The ability see design piece relates rest space also important factor determining size design
When designing functional piece furniture desk table mockups used test whether suit typical human shape size
Designs fail consider issue may practical use
Mockups also used test color finish design detail visualized initial drawing sketch
Mockups used purpose reduced scale
The cost making mockups often repaid saving made avoiding going production design need improvement
The common use mockups software development create user interface show end user software look like without build software underlying functionality
Software UI mockups range simple hand drawn screen layout realistic bitmap semi functional user interface developed software development tool
Mockups often used create usually called
The main reason create mockups able test one part software system unit without use dependent module
The function dependency faked using mock object
This especially important function simulated like difficult obtain example involves complex computation result readout sensor
A common style software design SOA many component communicate via
example implementation mockups called modelling dependent SOA environment
Mockup software also used micro level evaluation example check single function derive result test enhance product power usability whole
At beginning project construction architect often direct contractor provide material mockups review
These allow design team review material color selection make modification product order placed

What Mocking
Prologue If look noun dictionary find one definition word
Mocking primarily used unit testing
An object test may dependency complex object
To isolate behaviour object want test replace object mock simulate behavior real object
This useful real object impractical incorporate unit test
In short mocking creating object simulate behaviour real object
At time may want distinguish opposed
There may disagreement subject definition stub minimal simulated object
The stub implement enough behaviour allow object test execute test
A mock like stub test also verify object test call mock expected
Part test verifying mock used correctly
To give example You stub database implementing simple structure storing record
The object test read write record database stub allow execute test
This could test behaviour object related database database stub would included let test run
If instead want verify object test writes specific data database mock database
Your test would incorporate assertion written database mock
There plenty answer SO good post web mocking
One place might want start looking post Martin Fowler discus lot idea mocking
In one paragraph Mocking one particlar technique allow testing unit code reliant upon dependency
In general differentiates mocking method mock object used replace code dependency allow expectation set mock object know meant called code respond
Your original question mentioned TypeMock I left answer TypeMock name
It offer feature free mocking framework like RhinoMocks Moq plus powerful option
Whether need TypeMock highly debatable mocking would ever want free mocking library many argue ability offered TypeMock often lead away well encapsulated design
As another answer stated actually defined concept could taken mean type mocking TypeMock offer using CLR profiler intercept call runtime giving much greater ability fake object requirement needing interface virtual method
Other answer explain mocking
Let walk
And believe actually far simpler think
It subclass original class
It data injected avoid testing injected part solely testing rest code
Let say writing iOS application network job test application
To whether network call work expected NOT YOUR DUTY
It another party duty test
You must remove network dependency yet continue test code work
A network call return different status code etc JSON response
Your app suppose work case error app throw expected error
What mocking create real network response like code JSON file test code without real network call waiting network response
You manually network response ALL different kind see app working expect
incorrect data responsibility responsibility test app correct case test app throw right error This creating real known mocking
In order CA use original code original code response right
You MUST add something dummy data normally needed part class
So SUBCLASS original class add whatever network HTTPResponse data OR case failure pas correct errorString HTTPResponse need subclass ie class
Long story short mocking testing also make feed class depends
In example instead whether app work expect class A good example mocking Just skip minute
I really like part transcript Because testing want make sure function called
We need make sure called Mock simulates behavior real controlled way
Mock object used unit testing
Often method test call external service method within
These called dependency
Once mocked dependency behave way defined
With dependency controlled mock easily test behavior method coded
This Unit testing
The purpose mocking type sever dependency order isolate test specific unit
Stubs simple surrogate mock surrogate verify usage
A mocking framework tool help generate stub mock
Since original wording mention type mocking I got impression related TypeMock
In experience general term mocking
Please feel free disregard info specifically TypeMock
TypeMock Isolator differs mocking framework work modifying IL fly
That allows mock type instance framework mock
To mock framework must provide abstraction mock
TypeMock offer great flexibility expense clean runtime environment
As side effect way TypeMock achieves result sometimes get strange result using TypeMock
I would think use TypeMock isolator mocking framework would TypeMocking
It tool generates mock use unit test without need write code IoC mind
If mock involves network request another alternative real test server hit
You use service generate request response testing
Mocking generating simulate real object behaviour test Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

I would like know difference Wireframes Mockups
I hoping gain simple understanding difference definitively know
I googled I could understand exactly difference I would appreciate someone could explain concisely
A functionality
It really simple sketch demonstrates sort thing design
For example wireframe website show navigation main button column placing different element
You think blueprint website
A realistic representation product look like case website
The final result look exactly like mockup variation version revision
While people prefer draw mockups using graphic software others straight
I use Balsamiq wireframes either Photoshop Illustrator HTML CSS depending complexity mockups
An example wireframe rudimentary shape line used designate position size
The goal wireframe fit element layout indicate element may actually appear final design located
built top wireframes go show overall appearance aspect design including type choice color choice etc
The goal mock show close possible final appearance rendered
I support detailed reply Yisela also add vision exposed Here short summary A wireframe low fidelity representation design
It clearly show The structure information
A description basic visualization user interface interaction
Wireframes used define framework information hierarchy demonstrate workflow provide detail screen description component work annotation
Depending complexity application site wireframes built upon another requirement deliverable process model
Wireframes used elicit requirement client eventually confirm requirement client
Wireframes visual model structure site application
They define font used padding color style etc
They scale tone gradient
All need communicated client understand process context wireframe deliverable conjunction requirement deliverable
A typically created Photoshop based structure framework confirmed wireframe deliverable distinct deliverable distinct schedule approval process
comp define visual style tone interface
Once accepted translate number additional requirement work product CSS code style guide graphical asset etc
Wireframes never
used wireframes would implication revision may required impact budget significantly
I got reputation yet comment Dave Kaye response I respond directly
It much worth noting reply comparison Rachuru brilliant answer
In interpretation modern phrase layman explanation The actual terminology originates
Back computing power produce imagery watch wireframes graphic floating around screen
A proper demo needed overnight rendering etc
In time wireframe represents skeleton design good iterative design process people generating mockups wireframe getting feedback passing back improve wireframe design
Unfortunately nowadays lot software available customer allow design mockups using anything directly usable programmer
Frequently design built upon others mockup get augmented privately rather brought back programmer factor grand design
I think effectively Dave little polite mentioning Keith To put simple aspect As people noted nowadays wireframes getting importance mockups fusing prototype
Have add one point people made answer give decent technical description work environment difference always clear
Some company might add functionality mockup might put design requirement wireframe
I careful getting locked answer thing first company go might something either
As per knowledge mockup screen final represenation UI look feel
What normal flow alternate flow
I think kind web prototype mostly created HTML CSS
We make mostly HLD phase show acceptance client
Wireframes compare concentrate like flow diagram general description
If represent detail description like happens clicking event change event similar thing
They mostly done BA mock done designer developer
More people attach technical specification wireframes like DB involved particular UI
But depends upon project project
In case wireframes stand source truth
This I understand difference A wireframe mockup
A mockup considered wireframe
While sometimes separate thing others stated often separate thing
At one time one might consider wireframes Visio would create
And Mockups would PhotoShop would create
But today range tool often actual document
At beginning may start wireframes purely layout function time become detailed point could considered mockup
And using interactive tool Axure certain point one could consider prototype
So spectrum lot overlap
When intend design mobile application web application first need sketch page going look like
Only based business concept designer define application flow first draft design sketch look like button field etc
That wireframe meant
Mockups alive picture
They visually appealing color font theme button logo etc
At stage label field note font type navigation menu etc
specified design
It exact representation mobile app look like web page look like
You find detailed comparison Wireframes Mockups informative article By posting answer agree

In simulated object mimic behavior real object controlled way
A programmer typically creates mock object test behavior object much way car designer us dynamic behavior human vehicle impact
In mock object behavior complex real object therefore useful real object impractical impossible incorporate unit test
If object following characteristic may useful use mock object place For example alarm clock program cause bell ring certain time might get current time outside world
To test test must wait alarm time know whether rung bell correctly
If mock object used place real object programmed provide time whether time alarm clock program tested isolation
Mock object real object mimic allowing client object remain unaware whether using real object mock object
Many available mock object framework allow programmer specify order invoked mock object passed well value returned
Thus behavior complex object network socket mimicked mock object allowing programmer discover whether object tested responds appropriately wide variety state mock object may
Classification mock fake highly inconsistent across literature
Consistent among literature though represent production object testing environment exposing interface
Which simplest inconsistent simplest always return response
On side spectrum complex object fully simulate production object complete logic exception etc
Whether mock fake stub trio fit definition inconsistent across literature
For example mock fake stub method implementation two end complexity spectrum might contain examine context call
For example mock object might assert order method called assert consistency data across method call
In book mock described fake object help decide whether test failed passed verifying whether interaction object occurred
Everything else defined stub
In book anything real based usage either
Consider example authorization mocked
The mock object implement method match real authorization class
Many advantage follow also expose property present real class
This allows test code easily set expectation user granted permission next call therefore readily test behavior rest system either case
Similarly setting could ensure subsequent call cause without responding return etc
Thus possible develop test behavior realistic fault condition well expected response
Without simple flexible mock system testing situation may laborious given proper consideration
A mock database object method may contain much implementation code
It might check existence perhaps Person object passed saving see fake mock discussion beyond might implementation
This missed opportunity
The mock method could add entry public log string
The entry need Person saved may include detail person object instance name ID
If test code also check final content log string various series operation involving mock database possible verify case exactly expected number database save performed
This find otherwise invisible bug example developer nervous losing data coded repeated call one would sufficed
Programmers working TDD method make use mock object writing software
Mock object meet requirement stand complex real one thus allow programmer write functionality one area without calling complex underlying collaborating
Using mock object allows developer focus test behavior system test without worrying dependency
For example testing complex algorithm based multiple object particular state clearly expressed using mock object place real object
Apart complexity issue benefit gained practical speed issue involved
Developing realistic piece software using TDD may easily involve several hundred unit test
If many induce communication database web service system suite unit test quickly become slow run regularly
This turn lead bad habit reluctance developer maintain basic tenet TDD
When mock object replaced real one functionality need testing
These rather unit test
The use mock object closely couple implementation code tested
For example many mock object framework allow developer check order number time mock object method invoked real object tested subsequent code tested could therefore cause test fail even though mocked object method still obey contract previous implementation
This illustrates unit test test method external behavior rather internal implementation
mock object part suite unit test result dramatic increase amount maintenance need performed test system evolution refactoring take place
The improper maintenance test evolution could allow bug missed would otherwise caught unit test use instance real class
Conversely simply mocking one method might require far le configuration setting entire real class therefore reduce maintenance need
Mock object accurately model behavior object mocking difficult achieve object mocked come another developer project even written yet
If behavior modelled correctly unit test may register pas even though failure would occur run time condition unit test exercising thus rendering unit test inaccurate

I freshman UX design find difficult understand difference wireframe prototype
Are referring thing
Wireframes schematic display basic element without going detail
Prototype detailed simulation future design often point mimicking interaction
It created paper specific program coding dummy data service
class design include wireframes design prototype
asked need check detail level unless already understood
A wireframe outline sketch layout
It look anything like real finished product
It show various element
A prototype exact definition way differentiating
I would say sound like something still fairly early stage whilst prototype almost complete beta version almost
However feeling generally two word fairly interchangeable
In year experience I never found used consistently rely meaning thing someone talk wireframe mockup
Especially Mockups Some visual designer call high fidelty visual design mockup UX people call low fidelity thing mockup
On Prototypes also huge variety
But generally prototype simulates different state minimum interactivity
I like take Todd Zaki Warfel prototype A prototype regardless fidelity functionality made capture intent design simulates multiple state design
Wireframes storyboards static representation design merit simulate multiple state design
simulation multiple state part creates distinction
Prototyping A Practitioner Guide
By Todd Zaki Warfel I suggest think usage one thing
often referring zoning I always start one
Using page template
look really often like answer I add little precision supposed real text real picture
supposed simulate user interaction different state etc
You protoypes based mockups wireframes prototype based graphic design even condition real etc
I would say prototype By posting answer agree

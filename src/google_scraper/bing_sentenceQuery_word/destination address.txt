corresponds
How many byte start Ethernet frame ASCII G GET appear Ethernet frame
byte
What value Ethernet source address
Is address computer Hint answer Ethernet address
This address router
What destination address Ethernet frame
Is Ethernet address computer
This address computer
Give hexadecimal value Frame type field
What upper layer protocol correspond
corresponds
How many byte start Ethernet frame ASCII O OK HTTP response code appear Ethernet frame
byte
Write content computer ARP cache
What meaning column value
T
What hexadecimal value source destination address Ethernet frame containing ARP request message

Give hexadecimal value Ethernet Frame type field
What upper layer protocol correspond
bit flag represent mulitcast broadcast sent hte subnet internet
Download ARP specification ARP also How many byte beginning Ethernet frame ARP b What value Ethernet frame ARP request made
c Does ARP message contain IP address sender
Yes Where ARP request question appear Ethernet address machine whose corresponding IP address queried
In target IP address
Now find ARP reply sent response ARP request
How many byte beginning Ethernet frame ARP b What value Ethernet frame ARP response made
c Where ARP message answer earlier ARP request appear IP address machine Ethernet address whose corresponding IP address queried
In sender MAC address
What hexadecimal value source destination address Ethernet frame containing ARP reply message
Destination ff ff ff ff ff ff Source
Open ARP packet trace correspond ARP request sent computer running Wireshark ARP reply sent computer running Wireshark computer Ethernet address
But yet another computer network indicated packet another ARP request
Why ARP reply sent response ARP request packet packet trace
Because host computer router maintains ARP table therefore give sender answer
Only router running network respond ARP request

So I understand internet router route packet source host destination host using network address possible maintain route table IP address
My question router separate network address IP address
Does IP packet contain network address also
contain class IP address belong etc
time router internet looking destination IP address routing packet internet
They first inspect packet destination IP address perform lookup routing table looking specific route match IP address
Routes considered specific longer network mask example consider router two route within local routing table
via via If received packet destination address would use specific route specific maximum length bit long
Therefore packet would routed interface providing connectivity next hop
Where packet destined would use specific route best possible route subnet best route moment
This packet would routed interface providing connectivity next hop address Finally worth noting routing table generally built internet using dynamic routing protocol called BGP go long process determining route install within routing table even packet start route
Classes really exist anymore
Modern router route network number subnet length
The packet contains destination IP address
The router route packet using matching route longest subnet length
Sometimes called longest prefix specific matching route
This explained well Wikipedia page
Full explanation found howstuffworks
Basically router need know whether packet local remote
If local delivers package directly anything else delivered another router router connected

If TCP segment contain destination IP header first network layer decide first link traverse get closer destination IP
I learnt network layer prepares header source destination IP add TCP segment make IP packet
The application layer decides send message provide destination IP
It make sense application layer delegate network layer care end end communication routing forwarding alone
We resolve host name IP address using DNS IP address information passed lower Network layer without TCP segment mention explicitly header
I hope Operating System providing socket abstraction end end communication
I seen socket getting created parameter follows Is true end layer drop message socket Network layer obtains destination IP information socket
I hope go follows Resolve host name IP address using default DNS entry solve chicken egg problem Create socket IP address obtained suitable transport protocol parameter Use socket communication remote system I missing lot detail I new socket programming network
Help understand process
Will glad someone cite detailed material give complete process

The size computer network along bandwidth growing exponentially
To support large network necessary able forward packet microsecond
One part forwarding operation consists searching large address database
This problem encountered design adapter bridge router gateway name server
Caching reduce lookup time locality address reference pattern
Using destination reference trace measured extended local area network attempt see destination reference significant locality
We compared performance MIN LRU FIFO random cache replacement algorithm
We found interactive terminal traffic sample quite different locality behavior noninteractive traffic
The interactive traffic follow LRU stack model noninteractive traffic
Examples shown environment caching help well caching hurt unless cache size large

style written term needed specific type provided
This approach pioneered permit writing common differ set type operate used thus reducing
Such software entity known
They known Haskell community also us term generic related somewhat different concept influential book
The author note technique especially combined powerful however Dynamic highly parameterized software harder understand static software
The term originally coined specific sense describe programming paradigm whereby fundamental requirement type abstracted across concrete example algorithm data structure formalised implemented term concept typically using language genericity mechanism described
Generic programming defined follows Generic programming center around idea abstracting concrete efficient algorithm obtain generic algorithm combined different data representation produce wide variety useful software
Generic programming paradigm approach software decomposition whereby fundamental requirement type abstracted across concrete example algorithm data structure formalised analogously abstraction algebraic theory
Early example programming approach implemented Scheme Ada although best known example STL developed theory used decouple sequence data structure algorithm operating
For example given sequence data structure
singly linked list vector algorithm operate
direct approach would implement algorithm specifically data structure giving combination implement
However generic programming approach data structure return model iterator concept simple value type dereferenced retrieve current value changed point another value sequence algorithm instead written generically argument iterators
pair iterators pointing beginning end subsequence process
Thus data combination need implemented
Several iterator concept specified STL refinement restrictive concept
forward iterators provide movement next value sequence
suitable singly linked list stream input data whereas iterator also provides direct access element sequence
suitable vector
An important point data structure return model general concept implemented requirement explicitly part concept definition
This limit data structure given algorithm applied complexity requirement major determinant data structure choice
Generic programming similarly applied domain
graph algorithm
Note although approach often utilizes language feature fact independent particular detail
Generic programming pioneer Alexander Stepanov wrote Generic programming abstracting classifying algorithm data structure
It get inspiration Knuth type theory
Its goal incremental construction systematic catalog useful efficient abstract algorithm data structure
Such undertaking still dream
I believe iterator theory central Computer Science theory central Mathematics
noted Following Stepanov define generic programming without mentioning language feature Lift algorithm data structure concrete example general abstract form
Other programming paradigm described generic programming include described Generic Programming Introduction
The approach lightweight generic programming approach Haskell
In article distinguish programming language used implement see
For discussion comparison generic programming paradigm see
Genericity facility existed language since least language subsequently adopted many language including defunct language
Genericity implemented supported differently various programming language term generic also used differently various programming context
For example execute code compiling one create new new implementation word fly
It expose compiler behaviour therefore naturally offer capacity however referred Forth text
Similarly dynamically typed language especially interpreted one usually offer default passing value function value assignment behavior often utilized abstraction code terseness however typically labeled direct consequence dynamic typing system employed language
The term used specifically language use type always parametric actual code type generic
These usage still serve similar purpose rendering abstraction
viewed predefined generic type
Every usage array struct type instantiates new concrete type reuses previous instantiated type
Array element type struct element type parameterized type used instantiate corresponding generic type
All usually syntax differs generic construct
Some try unify user defined generic type
A broad survey genericity mechanism programming language follows
For specific survey comparing suitability mechanism generic programming see
When creating container class statically typed language inconvenient write specific implementation datatype contained especially code datatype virtually identical
For example duplication code circumvented defining class template Above placeholder whatever type specified list created
These commonly called allow class reused different datatypes long certain contract kept
This genericity mechanism confused usage exchangeable instance list object type containing object type
Templates also used function example The construct used widely cited genericity construct popularized notion among programmer language designer support many generic programming idiom
The D programming language also offer fully template based precedent simplified syntax
The Java programming language provided genericity facility syntactically based since introduction
also known Chrome construct take advantage support generic present since version generic since first designed
The standard library us generic provide many service
Ada add comprehensive generic container library standard library inspired
A package subprogram take one
A value variable constant type subprogram even instance another designated generic unit
For generic formal type syntax distinguishes discrete access pointer type etc
Some formal parameter default value
To generic unit programmer pass parameter formal
The generic instance behaves like unit
It possible instantiate generic unit example inside loop
The specification generic package Instantiating generic package Using instance generic package The language syntax allows precise specification constraint generic formal parameter
For example possible specify generic formal type accept modular type actual
It also possible express constraint generic formal parameter example In example constrained
When instantiating unit programmer must pas actual array type satisfies constraint
The disadvantage control complicated syntax generic formal parameter completely defined specification instantiate generic without looking body generic
Unlike Ada allow specialised generic instance requires generic instantiated explicitly
These rule several consequence us template enable generic programming technique
The Standard Library includes STL provides framework template common data structure algorithm
Templates may also used way code rather
Using template specialization Templates considered
There two kind template function template class template
A pattern creating ordinary function based upon parameterizing type supplied instantiated
For example Standard Template Library contains function template creates function return either whichever larger
could defined like function template instantiation specific type called like ordinary function The compiler examines argument used call determines call
It instantiates version function parameterizing type making equivalent following function This work whether argument integer string type expression sensible specifically type defined
Common inheritance needed set type used similar
A program defining custom data type use operator overloading define meaning type thus allowing use function template
While may seem minor benefit isolated example context comprehensive library like STL allows programmer get extensive functionality new data type defining operator
Merely defining allows type used standard algorithm put inside data structure heap associative array
template completely compile time
As demonstration standard type define operator strict order
Therefore fail compile error value
Likewise template rely applied data unless comparison form functor function provided

A used key unless comparison provided
Unfortunately compiler historically generate somewhat esoteric long unhelpful error message sort error
Ensuring certain object adheres alleviate issue
Languages use instead also use value key
The second kind template extends concept class
A class template specialization class
Class template often used make generic container
For example STL container
To make linked list integer one writes
A list string denoted
A set standard function associated work compatible parameterizing type
A powerful feature template
This allows alternative implementation provided based certain characteristic parameterized type instantiated
Template specialization two purpose allow certain form optimization reduce code bloat
For example consider template function
One primary activity function swap exchange value two container position
If value large term number byte take store often quicker first build separate list pointer object sort pointer build final sorted sequence
If value quite small however usually fastest swap value needed
Furthermore parameterized type already need build separate pointer array
Template specialization allows template creator write different implementation specify characteristic parameterized type must implementation used
Unlike function template class template
That mean alternate version class template code provided template parameter known leaving template parameter generic
This used example create default implementation assumes copying parameterizing type expensive create partial specialization type cheap copy thus increasing overall efficiency
Clients class template use specialization without needing know whether compiler used primary specialization partial specialization case
Class template also mean alternate implementation provided parameterizing type known
Some us template function previously filled legacy
For example possible macro Macros expanded compilation proper template expanded compile time
Macros always expanded inline template also expanded inline function compiler deems appropriate
Thus macro function template overhead
However template generally considered improvement macro purpose
Templates
Templates avoid common error found code make heavy use macro evaluating parameter side effect twice
Perhaps importantly template designed applicable much larger problem macro
There three primary drawback use template compiler support poor error message
Many compiler historically poor support template thus use template make code somewhat le portable
Support may also poor compiler used attempting use template across boundary
Most modern compiler however fairly robust standard template support new standard address issue
Almost compiler produce confusing long sometimes unhelpful error message error detected code us template
This make template difficult develop
Finally use template requires compiler generate separate templated class function every type parameter used
This necessary type size size data field important class work
So indiscriminate use template lead resulting excessively large executables
However judicious use template specialization derivation dramatically reduce code bloat case So derivation used reduce problem code replicated template used
This would involve deriving template ordinary class
This technique proved successful curbing code bloat real use
People use technique like found replicated code cost megabyte code space even moderate size program
In simple case template transformed generic causing code bloat creating class getting parameter derived type compile time wrapping template around class
It nice approach creating generic container
The extra instantiation generated template also cause debugger difficulty working gracefully template
For example setting debug breakpoint within template source file may either miss setting breakpoint actual instantiation desired may set breakpoint every place template instantiated
Also compiler need perform expansion template generate different instance compile time implementation source code templated class function must available
included header code using
Templated class function including much Standard Template Library STL included header file compiled
This contrast code may compiled binary providing declaration header file code using
This may disadvantage exposing implementing code remove abstraction could restrict use project
The support template based design
Most template idiom carry D without alteration D add additional functionality Templates D use different syntax whereas template parameter wrapped angular bracket D us exclamation sign parenthesis
This avoids due ambiguity comparison operator
If one parameter parenthesis omitted
Conventionally D combine feature provide using generic programming
For example input defined type satisfies check performed defined follows A function accepts input range use template template constraint In addition template metaprogramming D also provides several feature enable code generation Combining allows generating code based existing declaration
For example D serialization framework enumerate type member generate specialized function serialized type perform serialization deserialization
attribute could indicate serialization rule
The expression function execution also allow efficiently implementing
For example given function take string containing HTML template return equivalent D source code possible use following way Generic class part since original method language design
The foundation publication Eiffel use term describe creation use generic class
Generic class declared class name list one
In following code class one formal generic parameter The formal generic parameter placeholder arbitrary class name supplied declaration generic class made shown two class name
considered provide real class name substitute actual use
Within Eiffel type system although class considered class considered type
However generic derivation considered type
For list class shown actual generic parameter substituting available class
To constrain set class valid actual generic parameter chosen specified
In declaration class generic constraint dictate valid actual generic parameter class inherits class
The generic constraint ensures element fact sorted
Support added part
In Java generic checked compile time type correctness
The generic type information removed via process called maintain compatibility old JVM implementation making unavailable runtime
For example converted raw type
The compiler insert convert element type retrieved list reducing performance compared implementation template
Generics added part November based research prototype Microsoft Research started
Although similar generic Java generic apply implement generic first class mechanism runtime using
This design choice provides additional functionality allowing preservation generic type well alleviating limitation erasure unable create generic array
This also mean performance hit runtime normally expensive
When primitive value type used generic argument get specialized implementation allowing efficient generic method
As Java nested generic type Dictionary string List int valid type however advised member signature code analysis design rule
allows six variety generic type constraint using keyword including restricting generic type value type class constructor implement interface
Below example interface constraint The method allows operation array element generic type
The method type constraint indicates method applicable type implement generic interface
This ensures error method called type support comparison
The interface provides generic method
The method could also written without generic type simply using type
However since array casting would compiler may miss error would otherwise caught making use generic type
In addition method would need access array item object instead would require compare two element
For value type like type requires conversion although worked around using class done standard collection class
A notable behavior static member generic class static member instantiation per type see example
Object Pascal dialect acquired generic Delphi release initially discontinued compiler added native code one Delphi release
The semantics capability Delphi generic largely modelled generic though implementation necessity quite different
Here le direct translation first C example shown As C method well whole type one type parameter
In example TArray generic type defined language MakeAtLeast generic method
The available constraint similar available constraint C value type class specific class interface class parameterless constructor
Multiple constraint act additive union
implemented generic Delphi different syntax semantics
However work underway implement Delphi generic alongside native FPC one see
This allows Free Pascal programmer use generic whatever style prefer
Delphi Free Pascal example The mechanism support generic programming
Six predefined type class Haskell including type compared equality type whose value rendered string special property supporting This mean programmer defining new type state type instance one special type class without providing implementation class method usually necessary declaring class instance
All necessary method derived constructed automatically based structure type
For instance following declaration type state instance class This result equality function string representation function automatically defined type form provided support operation
The support derived instance make method generic qualitatively different way parametrically polymorphic function function accurately family function applied value various type although behave differently every argument type little work needed add support new type
Ralf Hinze shown similar effect achieved type class certain programming technique
Other researcher proposed approach kind genericity context Haskell extension Haskell discussed
PolyP first generic programming language extension
In PolyP generic function called
The language introduces special construct polytypic function defined via structural induction structure pattern functor regular datatype
Regular datatypes PolyP subset Haskell datatypes
A regular datatype must formal type argument definition recursive call must form
These restriction rule datatypes well nested datatypes recursive call different form
The flatten function PolyP provided example Generic Haskell another extension developed
The extension provides The resulting value specialised type
As example equality function Generic Haskell offer generic programming based PolyP generic Haskell supported GHC
It parametrizes kind offer overloading
The family programming language support generic programming generic called Both provide functors similar class template Ada generic package
syntactic abstraction also connection genericity fact superset templating à la
A module may take one parameter actual value assigned upon instantiation module
One example generic array array width given via parameter
Such array combined generic wire vector make generic buffer memory module arbitrary bit width single module implementation
derived Ada also generic ability

Outline architecture central processing unit CPU function arithmetic logic unit ALU control unit CU register within CPU
A major defining point history computing realisation data instruction manipulate data logically could stored place
The computer design built upon principle became known still basis computer today
Although name honour John von Neumann brilliant mathematician worked construction atomic bomb idea probably originated Presper Echkert John Mauchly two early pioneer worked ENIAC Moore School University Pennsylvania time period
Another major characteristic von Neumann architecture unit process information separate unit store information
This characteristic lead following component von Neumann architecture
Memory collection cell unique physical address
We use generic word cell rather byte number bit addressable location called memory varies one machine another
Today computer byte addressable
To fully illustrate concept memory take computer RAM example
The memory consists byte mean byte computer uniquely addressable machine bit
The cell memory numbered consecutively beginning
For example cell memory cell would addressed follows What content address
The bit pattern stored location
However content actually represents instruction value sign etc
discussed later
What important however understand bit pattern information interpreted
When referring bit byte word bit numbered right left beginning zero
The bit address numbered follows The capable performing basic arithmetic operation adding subtracting multiplying dividing two number
This unit also capable performing logical operation
The operates word natural unit data associated particular computer design
Historically word length computer number bit processed
However current Intel line processor blurred definition defining word length bit
The processor work word bit double word bit quadwords bit
In rest wiki referring word historical nature aforementioned
Most modern small number special storage unit called
These register contain one word used store information needed immediately
For example calculation
first added result multiplied
Rather storing result adding memory retrieving multiply result left register content register multiplied
Access register much faster access memory location
All computing power world would useful one could input value calculation outside report outside result said calculation
Input output unit channel computer communicates outside world
An device data program outside world entered computer
The first input unit interpreted hole punched paper tape card
input device however include limited keyboard mouse camera also known simply webcam scanning device
An device result stored computer memory made available outside world
Examples include printer screen monitor
The organising force computer charge
There two special register control unit
The contains instruction executed contains address next instruction executed
Because control unit work closely together often thought one unit called
Above simplified view flow information part von Neumann machine
The part connected one another collection wire called bus data travel computer
Each bus carry three kind information address data control
An address used select memory location device data go taken
Data flow bus CPU memory Devices
The control information used manage flow address data
For example control signal typically used determine direction data flowing either CPU
The number bit transfer simultaneously
The wider bus address data bit move
Explain use cache memory
Because memory access time consuming relative speed processor many architecture provide
Cache memory small amount memory copy frequently used data stored
Before main memory access made CPU check whether data stored cache memory
another technique used speed
This technique split instruction smaller step overlapped
In personal computer component von Neumann machine reside physically printed circuit board called
The motherboard also connection attaching device bus mouse keyboard additional storage device
So mean say machine processor
The variable usually refers number bit CPU general register Two number added single instruction
It also refer width bus size addressable always
In addition refer width data always
Explain machine instruction cycle
Before looking computer let u look
The definition computer outline capability computer electronic device store retrieve process data
Therefore instruction give computer relate storing retrieving processing data
The underlying principle von Neumann machine data instruction stored memory treated alike
This mean instruction data addressable
Instructions stored contiguous memory location data manipulated stored together different part memory
To start Cycle first data loaded main memory operating system address first instruction placed onto
The process cycle includes four step The increment one one point next instruction executed control unit go address memory address register hold address next instruction specified take main memory address bus return memory buffer register via data bus
The MBR two way register temporarily hold data fetched Memory cache RAM make copy content place copy
At point contains instruction executed
Before going next step cycle must updated hold address next instruction executed current instruction completed
There instruction register responsible instruction solved CU
CU check status instruction allows execution
Because instruction stored contiguously memory adding number byte current instruction put address next instruction
Thus control unit increment
It possible may changed later instruction executed
In case instruction must get additional data memory sends address memory bus memory responds returning value location
In computer data retrieved memory may immediately participate arithmetic logical operation
Other computer simply save data returned memory register processing subsequent instruction
At end execution result instruction may saved either register memory
To execute instruction instruction register control unit determine instruction
It might instruction access data input device send data output device perform operation data value
At phase instruction decoded control signal
That logic circuitry determines operation executed
This step show computer execute instruction expressed machine language
The instruction literally built circuit
The instruction executed may potentially require additional memory access complete task
For example instruction say add content memory location register control unit must get content memory location
Once instruction decoded operand data fetched control unit ready execute instruction
Execution involves sending signal unit carry processing
In case adding number register operand sent added content register
When execution complete cycle begin
If last instruction add value content register next instruction probably say store result place memory
However next instruction might control instruction asks question result last instruction perhaps change content program counter
Hardware changed dramatically last yet von Neumann model remains basis computer today
As Alan Perlis computer scientist said Describe primary memory
RAM stand Memory
RAM memory cell usually byte directly accessed
Inherent idea able access location ability content location
That storing something else place change bit pattern cell
In addition RAM computer contain second kind memory called ROM
ROM stand Memory
The content location ROM changed
Their content permanent altered second operation
Placing bit pattern ROM called
The bit pattern burnt either time ROM manufactured time computer part assembled
RAM ROM differentiated basic property RAM ROM
This mean RAM retain bit configuration power turned ROM
Because ROM stable changed used store instruction computer need start
Frequently used software also stored ROM system read software time machine turned
Main memory usually contains ROM along RAM
Identify need persistent storage
An input device mean data program entered computer stored memory
An output device mean result sent back user
Because main memory volatile limited essential type storage device program data stored longer processed machine turned
These type storage device main memory called storage device
Because data must read written storage device also input output device
Examples secondary storage device include Describe main function operating system

Recall executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another cycle
technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform keep track program memory memory reside
Another key operating system concept idea defined program execution
A program static set instruction
A process dynamic entity represents program executed
Through multiprogramming computer system might many active process
The operating system must manage process carefully
At point time specific instruction may next executed
Intermediate value calculated
A process might interrupted execution operating system performs carefully track progress process intermediate state

The following section Single Contiguous Memory Management Partition Memory Management Paged Memory Management interest purpose
The Computer Science Guide clearly note technical detail needed
For example memory management described handled multitasking environment expected
Therefore section serve purpose illustrating memory management technique summarised rather utilised exam
Has operating system one program memory one time
This basic type memory management
The memory broken different part
Has operating system number program running time different partition
The partition base bound register
Base register Bounds register Partition selection First fit Best fit Worst fit A technique process divided page stored memory frame loaded
Frame Page The number system specifies number digit used system
The digit always begin continue one le base
For example digit base
There digit base
There digit base
The base also determines position digit mean
When one add last digit number system one carry digit position left
Numbers written using
The rightmost digit represents value multiplied base zeroth power
The digit left one represents value multiplied base first power
The next digit represents value multiplied base second power
The next digit represents value multiplied base third power
One usually familiar positional notation even aware
One instinctively inclined utilise method calculate number one A formal way defining positional notation say value represented polynomial base number system
But polynomial
A polynomial sum two algebriac term consists constant multiplied one variable raised integral power
When defining positional notation variable base number system
Thus represented polynomial follows acting base To express idea formally number number system digit represented follows represents digit th position number Look complicated
Take concrete example base
Here number exactly digit base
The formula state fifth digit last digit left multiplied base fourth power fourth digit multiplied base third power In previous calculation one assumed number base
This logical assumption generic number system base
However reason number could represent value base
In order distinguish value general notation utilised order represent number base
Therefore number found base system
In order turn turn one simply us previous calculation Therefore base equal base
One must keep mind two number equivalent value
That represent number thing
If one bag contains bean second bag contains bean bag contain exact number bean
The number system allow one represent value various way
Note base rightmost digit one position
In base rightmost digit also one position
In fact true base anything raised power zero one
Why would anyone want represent value base
It done often granted sometimes helpful understand work
For example computing technique called hashing take number scramble one way scramble number interpret different base
Other base base binary particularly important computer processing
The binary number system particularly important computing
It also helpful familiar number system power ase base octal base hexadecimal
Recall base digit base two digit base eight digit
Therefore number could represent value base le digit exist base
It however valid number base base higher
Likewise number valid number base higher simply exist us digit base lower
What digit base higher
One need assign symbol represent digit correspond decimal value beyond
In base higher one generally look towards letter digit
The letter A consequently represent number B represent C represent forth
Therefore digit base Focusing value binary octal hexadecimal represent number base one calculate example decimal equivalent octal base simply put finding
As case expanding number polynomial form adding number And converting hexadecimal number decimal Define Boolean operator AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
Construct truth table using operator
The gate computer sometimes referred logic gate perform one logical function
That gate accepts one input value produce single output value
Because one dealing binary information input output either corresponding signal corresponding signal
The type gate input value determine output value
A NOT gate accepts one input value produce one output value
The table right illustrates NOT gate three way Boolean expression logical diagram symbol using truth table
In representation variable represents input signal either
The variable represents output signal whose value determined value
By definition input value NOT gate output input value output
A NOT gate sometimes referred inverts input value
In Boolean expression NOT operation represented mark value begin negated
Sometimes operation shown horizontal bar value begin negated
In Boolean expression table assigned value determined applying NOT operation input value
In variable left equal sign take value expression side
The logical diagram symbol NOT gate triangle small circle called end
The input output shown line flowing gate
Sometimes line labeled though always
The truth table show possible input value NOT gate well corresponding output value
Because one input signal NOT gate signal two possibility column labelled A truth table
The column labelled show output gate inverse input
Note three representation truth table actually defines behaviour gate situation
These three notation different way representing thing example result Boolean expression always result Boolean expression always
This behaviour consistent value shown truth table
Unlike NOT gate accepts one input signal AND gate accepts two input signal
The value input signal determine output signal
If two input value AND gate output otherwise output
The AND operation Boolean algebra expressed using single dot case asterisk
Often operator assumed example often written
Because two input two possible value input four possible combination provided input AND gate
Therefore four situation occur AND operator used Boolean expression
Likewise truth table showing behaviour AND gate four row showing four possible input combination
Like AND gate two input OR gate
If two input value output value otherwise input
The Boolean algebra OR operation expressed using plus sign
The OR gate two input one two value AND gate four input combination therefore four row truth table
The XOR OR gate illustrated right
An XOR gate produce two input otherwise
Note difference XOR gate OR gate differ one input situation
When input signal OR gate produce XOR produce
Sometimes regular OR gate referred OR produce either input
The XOR produce input mixed one one
Think XOR gate saying When I say I mean one
The Boolean algebra symbol sometimes used express XOR operation
However XOR operation also expressed using operator leave exercise
Note logic diagram symbol XOR gate like symbol OR gate except extra curved line connecting input signal
The NAND NOR gate accept two input value
The NAND NOR gate essentially opposite AND OR gate respectively
That output NAND gate one took output AND gate put inverter NOT gate
There typically specific symbol used express NAND NOR gate operation Boolean algebra
Instead one rely definition express concept
That Boolean algebra expression NAND negation AND operation
Likewise Boolean algebra expression NOR negation OR operation
The logic diagram symbol NAND NOR AND OR except NAND NOR symbol inversion bubble indicate negation
Compare output column truth table AND NAND
They opposite row row
The true OR NOR gate
Six specific type gate observed
It may seem difficult task keep straight remember work
Well probably depends one think
One encouraged try memorise truth table
The processing gate described briefly general term
If one think way one produce appropriate truth table time needed
Some description term input value cause gate produce n output case produce Construct logic diagram using AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
A combinational circuit consists logic gate whose output determined time present combination input irrespective previous consists input variable logic gate output variable
The logic gate accept signal input generate signal example combinational circuit binary adder decimal adder decoder multiplexer half adder half subtractor etc
A logic circuit addition two number called half adder
addition process reproduced truth table

Khan Academy also put great course Algorithms go go already great course Cryptography Information theory
A couple question person get foot wet decide whether persue career computer
If I follow course I need go university
Will set link give skill I need get started
Hey Jason hard question answer
There much list would required specific college level computer science curriculum
If want jump see like might try working one introductory course see interested enough keep going
Madmin rock
Thanks Anon
Hi Jose quite ambitious
I completed course year half plus countless tutorial
You might also want check previous post create simple learning absolute beginner http I love article part wonder well might compare programming instruction book
My background engineering I always found programming fascinating
However learning I always felt like I needed hand held I wonder programming python etc dummy book would work better
Alternatively I aware paid learning site asks monthly fee sequentially guide web development programming
I suppose I feel overwhelmed even starting back free college course
There LOT lecture note quiz go I wondering faster way since I basic background programming
There ton great free intro Python tutorial
See http You might also interested checking previous post lay learning time table intro programming course MIT us Python language choice http Hello Admin
Thanks great list
Well link Theory Computation IIT Kanpur broken
Youtube video available
I believe link work fine http Question Madmin
First thanks hard work compiling course
I bachelor unrelated field computer science recently become interested computer programming
In opinion would completing curriculum suffice resume applying IT job would one go back college formal bachelor CS get hired
hmmm hard say
But job listing I looked often find employer looking people bachelor computer science equivalent experience
In experience working course list I already able thing made much competitive field directly tech computer science related
Hey Madmin Thanks work compiling
I wondering completing course I actually bachelor level knowledge computer science
I I fanatic programmer
Hey anon good
I would argue since pretty much course bachelor level course accredited university college would pretty darn close
I tempted argue someone studying might end someone studied formally school major something get degree
However thing ca get course online academic community including professor fellow student teacher assistant adviser would actual campus
That kind interaction provides vital feedback learning process
But time also compensated somewhat participating local meetups talk lecture participating forum people congregate online contributing open source project thing nature
Thanks really goo
Good course I always wanted get software development compilation gave mean motivation
So thank
Quick question though I see category seem similar course ex
Intro Computer Science seemingly similar course different institution
Should I pick one
I say watch first lecture decide one want
The first lecture given course almost always provides really good overview
You might find like one professor another interest one language use one rather another interest topic focus one rather another
Conceptually intro course cover much material basic
Personally I MIT intro course first I interested Python
It fun I learned ton
Thank much compiling wonderful list
I one question really
Would okay go every course provided top bottom
By I mean ask would good idea go MIT Harvard Stanford back MIT etc
I feel learning multiple university also experiencing multiple language would give wide array work
Would better try stick one source per go
I thank advance answer I simply feel though I might head wrong way going course could also beneficial
Please respond whenever
Thanks
I say take one time
There A LOT OF MATERIAL
It would take year go course
My recommendation watch first lecture intro course thinking decide one appeal
After better idea like next
I started MIT Intro course data structure course algorithm web dev programming paradigm well networking crypto course
Hello I want know Intro course MIT many lecture
You luck previously published post detailing time table completion precise course http Fantastic post friend
I quite ecstatic found extremely valuable Info
Great post
Is similar curriculum available learning computer engineering
Thanks
Thanks Now day online learning popular people much easy learn anything topic
So I think day day increase lot people come learn online course sure
Thanks lot
This awesome
Thank
This awesome
Thank much
I already Post Graduate Diploma Computer Science I wish know certifying body willing access knowledge computer science thereafter give Bachelors degree
Note class Statistics Probability I taken Johns Hopkins Statistical Inference Duke Data Analysis Statistical Inference course
I say Johns Hopkins course terrible review I partially agree
That mostly JHU course breadth depth
It throw lot information statistical inference really information overflow good way willing consult external resource complement learning
It also assumes already familiar programming R since course part series Data Science specialization exclusively us R okay beginner statistical mathematics
Duke Data Analysis Statistical Inference hand geared much towards beginner
It assumes prior knowledge statistic probability
It cover wide range topic sure dive deep basic foundational concept statistic probability
The lab also teach program R total beginner
If I taken Duke course JHU I know I would beyond lost
There tends lot jargon Johns Hopkins Statistical Inference course compensated prior knowledge desire consult external resource
I say take Duke Data Analysis Statistical Inference Johns Hopkins Statistical Inference sure
The foundational knowledge Statistics introduction programming R get speed JHU Statistical Inference
In retrospect prior knowledge Johns Hopkins course really bad
Cant thank enough Thanks keeping track
Would update list
I would recommend book following course http It work bottom transistor level making strong foundation CS knowledge
This really awesome post
Georgia Tech also offer many graduate level comp sci course free Udacity http Udacity also ton free course university level computer science course could added list course specific practical career advancement
Hello Madmin Can please add pick two three pick two two etc course schedule also mention optional
Thanks Sal Hello Madmin I wanted know supposed take original course first course instead previous one
That really
There overlap
This one contains course intermediate advanced level
Are curriculum like every subject
I wish
That actually something I considering though putting together similar list different subject
This list pretty good I think level need addressed learning
I tried without much success set IDE like Eclipse
Python difficult least get working
I window person Unix lot apps I need everyday
I tried work Eclipse Python came back lot Java stuff like ant build thing
Git thing would nice know start programming
I actually finding Python easy use since get pyc file actually run
The easiest one I found Spyder seems easiest integrated starter
There lot different IDEs without easy one lot common language little hard actually anything productive
IDLE make learn curriculum
Yes I actually saw conference talk educator brought issue getting development environment running developing good habit significant hurdle people
For info might find good tip list Python resource beginner intermediate programmer http In term IDEs Jetbrains PyCharm Community Edition favorite work
It free ton functionality good supporting documentation get stuck something
I worked fair amount Windows machine fairly painless set begin working
Definitely worth checking imo http After another month two I really made progress
Python library seem vastly superior language right fact Python interpreted must interpreter running big negative along need IDE practical purpose
PyPy seems discontinued
What I feel need self contained shell VM develop run program wo harm computer I learn
I get Unix
Maybe I unrealistic issue I
I took course community college year ago
The IDE fine resulted program I could run window computer compiled object code
To run Python program need interpreter program serious drawback
What fear Python program might harm computer
Do mean weird thing o sys module
Or mean Python system file
If latter might consider checking virtualenv create Python interpreter
If former could set Linux VM inside something like VirtualBox completely separate system run code think might harmful
We post set virtual machine inside VirtualBox http Well I trying weird thing I like able thing file directory I forget package called shutil
Linux I interested learning curve I want get I try learn Python
Yes life would lot easier I already knew I wanted learn
I using Windows PCs
If I ever finish course Operating Systems probably next thing I like try
Ah yes would indeed possible remove wrong directory tree shutil careful
If disc copy Windows OS could install virtual machine go town
But want bother virtualization another potential solution might create separate user account current Windows machine restrict user privilege ca thing like delete important directory account play around python module user
If interested operating system thing file directory definitely check o module ton interesting helpful stuff
excellent thanks lot Hi Madmin I completed MIT sure try next
Your original post suggested taking intro class updated post
Do still recommend
If good followup class take
I tried start MIT Alogrithms I looked first problem set realized I probably head
Thanks
haha I know exactly talking
The thing happened algorithm course I returned year later still completed
I found Introduction Data Structures Algorithms UNSW much easy digest
And two algorithm course I found easier jump first one much theoretically oriented second bit practical I think UC Davis http http As alternative algorithm might also check Stanford Programming Paradigms class I learned lot one
Hope help
Let u know go
cources many univercities programing language etc collide cources much time take
add harvard also add mitx question donot know calculus probablity othe mathematics used computer science plz reply Hi
Thanks great resource

A also fictional character created represent user type might use site brand product similar way
Marketers may use persona together qualitative persona constructed representative specific segment
The term persona used widely online technology application well advertising term may also used
Personas useful considering goal desire limitation buyer user order help guide decision service product interaction space feature interaction visual design website
Personas may also used part process designing also considered part used recently online marketing purpose
A user persona representation goal behavior hypothesized group
In case persona synthesized data collected interview user
They captured description include behavior pattern goal skill attitude environment fictional personal detail make persona realistic character
For product one persona usually created one persona always primary focus design
The concept understanding customer segment community coherent identity developed Angus Jenkinson internationally adopted OgilvyOne client using name CustomerPrints archetype description
Creating imaginal fictional character represent customer segment community followed
Jenkinson approach describe imaginal character real interface behavior attitude brand idea initially realized Michael Jacobs series study
In Ogilvy global knowledge management system Truffles described concept follows Each strong brand tribe people share affinity brand value
This universe typically divide number different community within similar buying behaviour whose personality characteristic towards brand product service understood term common value attitude assumption
CustomerPrints description capture living essence distinct group customer
Prior noted pioneer software developer developed concept Beginning started using prototype persona would become using data informal interview seven eight user
From became engaged specific rather generalized user would use interface software
The technique popularized online business technology community book
In book Cooper outline general characteristic us best practice creating persona recommending software designed single archetypal user
According Pruitt Adlin use persona offer several benefit
Personas said cognitively compelling put personal human face otherwise abstract data customer
By thinking need fictional persona designer may better able infer real person might need
Such inference may assist brainstorming use case specification feature definition
Pruitt Adlin argue persona easy communicate engineering team thus allow engineer developer others absorb customer data palatable format
They present several example persona used purpose communication various development project
Personas also help prevent common design pitfall may otherwise easy fall
The first designing Cooper call The Elastic User mean making product decision different may define according convenience
Defining persona help team shared understanding real user term goal capability context
Personas also help prevent design designer developer may unconsciously project mental model product design may different target user population
Personas also provide reality check helping designer keep focus design case likely encountered target user edge case usually wo happen target population
According Cooper edge case naturally handled properly become design focus
The benefit summarized Ethnographic research already discussed useful approach computer mediated communication late even linkage concept persona
Some designer feel persona based ethnographic research user based purely creator imagination
The use ethnographic research help creation number archetype user used develop product deliver positive user experience
By feeding real data ethnographic research allows design team avoid generating stereotypical user may bear relation actual user reality
The emerging field support identification extreme outlier outline archetype user real user lie outside stereotypical archetype
Conventional persona creation embedded simplified average edge case persona thrives diversity uniqueness describes persona need term unsentimental honest candid descriptor
Criticism persona fall three general category analysis underlying logic concern practical implementation
In term scientific logic argued persona fictional clear relationship real customer data therefore considered scientific
Chapman Milham described purported flaw considering persona scientific research method
They argued procedure work reliably given data specific persona thus process subject scientific method reproducible research
For practical implementation Portigal claimed persona give cloak smug actually distancing team engagement real user need
He argued story customer immersion would better serve designer understand need user
A fourth problem using persona organization ready methodology
Creating hypothetical user real name story personality may seem unserious whimsical people team organization
In empirical result research date offered soft metric success persona anecdotal feedback stakeholder
Rönkkö described team politics organizational issue led limitation persona method one set project
Chapman Love Milham Elrif Alford demonstrated survey data description attribute persona likely describe real people
They argued persona assumed descriptive actual customer
A study conducted Long claimed support Cooper Pruitt use persona
In partially controlled study group student asked solve design brief two group used persona one group
The student used persona awarded higher course evaluation group
Students used persona assessed produced design better usability attribute student use persona
The study also suggests using persona may improve communication design team facilitate design discussion
The study several limitation outcome assessed professor student blind hypothesis student assigned group fashion finding replicated contributing factor expectation effect controlled

The Is modern science study method process technique process transmit save data digital way
With great advance technology second half twentieth century discipline gaining importance productive activity increasing specificity
The development computer closed circuit robot machinery mobile phone emergence Internet make computer science one booming science recent decade
The etymology word computing several possible origin
It mainly emerged acronym word information automatique automatic information
In Who included term document called While French engineer Named company Société Appliquée
However Russian The first use term study organization dissemination scientific information
Among wide field application science dedicated study automatic processing information using electronic device computer system used different purpose
The field application computer science expanding spectrum technological development last half century mainly impulse computer Internet
Its main task include design development planning closed circuit document development monitoring process control
It also responsible creation industrial robot well task related vast field telecommunication making game application tool mobile device
Informatics science knowledge knowledge converge diverse discipline starting mathematics physic also computing programming design among others
This synergistic union different branch knowledge complemented computer science notion hardware software telecommunication internet electronics
First computer
The history computer science began much earlier discipline bear name
It accompanied humanity almost origin although without recognized science
Since creation Chinese abacus registered BC considered first computing device mankind spoken computer science
This table divided column allowed movement unit perform mathematical operation addition subtraction
There could starting point science
But evolution computing begun abacus
In seventeenth century One renowned French scientist time created calculating machine pushed evolutionary step
This device served addition subtraction basis German Almost year later eighteenth century develop similar apparatus multiplication division
These three creation first computerized process recorded
We wait almost year discipline become relevant become science
In first decade twentieth century development electronics ultimate impulse modern computing
From branch science begin solve technical problem arising new technology
At time change system based gear rod new process electrical impulse cataloged pass current revolutionized discipline
The final step took place World War II making first computer Mark I opened new field development still expanding
Informatics understood processing information automatically electronic device computer system must capability able develop
Three main operation fundamental entry refers collection information The processing information output possibility transmitting result
The set capability electronic device computational system known algorithm ordered set systematic operation perform calculation find solution
Through process computer science developed various type device began facilitate task humanity type activity
Although area strict limit mainly used industrial process business management information storage process control communication transportation medicine education
Within computing computing spoken five generation processor marked modern history emergence present
The first generation development computer built operated valve
Its evolution utility mainly field
These device mechanical circuit whose value modified programmed according necessary purpose
The second generation developed appearance transistor replaced old valve
Thus commercial device appeared enjoyed prior programming
Another central fact stage appearance first code programming language Cobol Fortran
To year later new one followed
The third generation slightly shorter development period predecessor lasted integrated circuit appeared
The lowering cost production device increase storage capacity reduction physical size marked stage
In addition thanks development programming language gained specificity skill first utilitarian program began flourish
The fourth generation came lasted decade electronic component main protagonist evolution
Thus began appear computer world first microprocessor included basic element old computer single integrated circuit
Finally fifth generation began extends present technology invades aspect modern society
The main development evolutionary phase computing personal computer PCs led vast group associated technology rule world

The persona approach stem IT system development late many researcher begun reflecting could communicate understanding user
In literature various concept emerged user archetype user model lifestyle snapshot model user I termed I first wrote method
In Alan Cooper published tremendously successful Cooper persona concept describe fictitious user introduced first time
Despite fact vast number article using persona written unilateral understanding application method definition persona description
The literature today offer four different perspective regarding persona Alan Cooper perspective Jonathan Grudin John Pruitt Tamara Adlin perspective engaging perspective I use emphasizes story engage reader perspective
The first three perspective agree persona description founded data
However fourth perspective perspective include data basis persona description creates persona designer intuition assumption name ad hoc persona assumption persona extreme character
Cooper characterizes persona method Design maintains make designer understand user
Thus Goal Directed Design meant efficient psychological tool looking problem guide design process
The central core method hypothetical archetype described average person rather unique character specific detail
The method focus move initial persona final persona
In beginning process large number persona created based
The initial persona grasp intuitive understanding user characteristic
Later condensed final persona one persona kind user
Every project set persona Floyd et
A persona defined personal practical goal well relationship product designed emotion persona using product goal persona using product hence
In word user work goal focus persona description
workflow context attitude
And implied advantage method provides focused design communication tool finish discussion
The perspective share goal direction Cooper also focus behaviour
The persona perspective massively incorporate data qualitative quantitative source
Often dozen persona shared among project Floyd et al
The starting point perspective criticism traditional IT system development approach Cooper approach persona
The traditional use scenario criticized lacking clarity consistency user description
Therefore critic introduced user archetype communicate important knowledge user thereby support design process
Jonathan Grudin John Pruitt criticized Alan Cooper underestimating value user involvement seeing method one single method handle anything Mikkelson Lee Grudin Pruitt
The perspective used criticism starting point develop method
The important addition firstly qualitative quantitative material must supplement persona description secondly clear relationship data persona description Grudin Pruitt
Personas communicate design decision designer client also communicate information test prototype participant project
Finally method regarded usability method stand alone used tandem method
The persona description contain information several issue big share market individual persona take much market influence persona user computer proficiency activity hope fear description typical day week life user
In addition strategic tactical consideration Pruitt Adlin
The perspective focus user role organization
Personas efficient design tool cognitive ability use fragmented incomplete knowledge form complete vision people surround u
With persona ability come play design process advantage greater sense involvement better understanding reality created
The engaging perspective rooted ability story produce involvement insight
Through understanding character story possible create vivid realistic description fictitious people
The purpose engaging perspective move designer seeing user stereotype unable identify whose life envision designer actively involving life persona
The persona perspective criticized causing risk stereotypical description looking whole person instead focusing behaviour Nielsen Nielsen Nielsen
The starting point engaging perspective way human interact people
We experience specific meeting time place
We mirror people meet
And experience others identical different
Also experience relationship specific person meet anonymous represents type
Here use experience understand person predict action perform
If designer see user stereotypical representation mould mental image user together number typical automated act
These representation prevent insight unique situation user reduce value scenario tool investigate describe future solution
An engaging description requires broad knowledge user data include information social background user psychological characteristic emotional relationship focus area
The persona description balance data knowledge real application fictitious information intended evoke empathy
This way persona method defence automated thinking
The persona perspective often used explore design generate discussion insight field Floyd et
Ad hoc persona based designer intuition experience used create empathetic focus design process Norman
Extreme character help generate design insight explore edge design space Djajadiningrat et al
Assumption persona based project team assumed understanding user Adlin Pruitt
originate company participant try encapsulate organization belief based domain expertise gut feeling using product service motivating
They give organization starting point begin evaluating product come early design hypothesis Gothelf
Pastiche scenario create persona derived fiction like Bridget Jones Ebenezer Scrooge help designer reflexive creating scenario Blythe Wright
Examples pastiche scenario seen Mark Blythe
These persona spurred discussion validity value see

In line Adlin Pruitt James Robertson article suggests continuum Persona Sketch Persona Hypothesis Provisional Personas Robust Personas ending Complete Personas
Floyd et
al
mention three additional type come across Quantitative data driven persona extracted natural grouping quantitative data User archetype persona similar persona generic usually defined role position Finally Marketing persona created marketing reason support design
Criticism persona method pertains empiricism especially relationship data fiction
The implementation persona method company also come fire Chapman et al Chapman Milham Portigal Rönkkö et al
Because persona description fictitious element find difficult see relationship real user way data used collected analysed
Furthermore fictitious element apparently prevent method regarded scientific one criterion scientific method study must reproducible
This critique based objectivistic scientific paradigm science consists statement verified
In interpretative paradigm science understood object continual clarification discussion Kvale
The persona method qualitative deep knowledge attitude behaviour gathered using qualitative method
Thus criticism disproven critic misunderstood starting point method
The method additionally criticized able describe actual people depicts characteristic
When come implementation method criticized preventing designer meeting actual user actual story encounter real user assumed give better understanding user need
Yet another objection method take consideration internal politics lead limited use
Lately latter refuted seen suggested step persona involve organisation many step possible
I provide brief introduction persona method useful design tool persona used constructed use consider communication persona
In design process begin imagine product work look sketch made feature described
If design team member number persona description front designing persona help maintain perspective user
The moment designer begin imagine possible product used persona idea emerge
Thus I maintain actual purpose method persona description ability imagine product
In following I designate product idea
It scenario imagine product going work used context used specific construction product
And work developing scenario product idea emerge described
The persona description thus mean develop specific precise description product
A scenario could described like Dorte sits computer ready handle reporting
She go look front page
Dorte try take
It new thus little daunting least look nice colour think time say What I I installed signature
I need find report form
Well look middle page maybe I try searching Dorte writes Apprentice refund search field launch search
A new screen appears short list hit
At top link form wanted
Excerpt scenario
In case designer got idea search field middle homepage
This would support shift information push old version webpage form retrieval new version
The front page additional search field Dorte focus reporting
The latest version portal yet unclear focus front page includes reporting different guideline example company When persona used IT system development mainly explore interaction
On hand suited describing kind information system contain
For four persona created
One persona Jesper accountant
Jesper represents user reporting company however including example agricultural consultant
When Jesper used scenario illustrates demand report behalf company product think would like see information presented
But Jesper represent information reporting form available site
If would reporting form agricultural consultant
In IT system development specific method describe system navigation interaction
Unified Modelling Language within method scenario described illustrated narrative story
It quite easy insert persona method
As persona method developed method IT system development also working within product development shift method occurred impact method used used
When persona used product development scenario take different path
Here user process interaction product easily understood way capturing idea le formalized
The persona ideally shaped according user study used
But process varies sometimes idea come first persona created later used verify enrich idea Chang et
Studies shown one main difficulty method get project participant use Browne
In following I present process model set cover problem throughout process
It contains four different main part analysis data step persona description step scenario problem analysis idea development step acceptance organization involvement design team step
The step cover entire process preliminary data collection active use continued development persona
It ideal process sometimes possible include step project Nielsen Nielsen
In first step collect much knowledge user possible
Data come many different source even knowledge organization
Based first data collection form general idea various user within focus area project including way user differ one another
In step goal support reject first hypothesis difference user
This happens confronting project participant hypothesis comparing existing knowledge
In step decide final number persona
The purpose working persona able develop solution based need user preparing persona description express enough understanding empathy reader understand user
As already mentioned method directed creating scenario describe solution
To purpose number specific situation could trigger use product described
In word situation basis precursor scenario
It common thread throughout step goal method involve project participant
This mean many possible participate development persona important obtain acceptance participant various step
That contribute accept situation
In order achieve choose two strategy You ask participant opinion let participate actively process
In order method used project team persona description disseminated
It therefore important early decide knowledge disseminated participated directly process future new employee possible external partner
The dissemination knowledge also includes project participant given access underlying data
As previously mentioned persona value
Not moment persona part scenario story persona us future product real value
The last step future life persona description
The description revised regularly approximately year
There new information world could change new aspect may affect description
Decisions made whether rewrite description add new persona whether possibly eliminated
The poster cover Steps Personas One perceived benefit persona give design team mental model particular kind user allows team predict user behaviour
The persona evoke empathy user prevent designer projecting need desire onto project Floyd et
For persona evoke empathy description need crafted way reader imagine real person understand person need desire predict person future action
In following I go detail persona scenario tightly interlinked evoke empathy identification
Here I thinking relationship fictitious character story general narrative structure
Using narrative nothing new within IT system development Madsen Nielsen story suggested starting point collect data method theorize various project type project phase
At time focus story play part providing insight go outside official course event
Thereby many often contradictory competing story interpretation circulate organization revealed
Stories also used want theorize organization IT system IT system development
An organization seen collective narrative system member construct play sequence event basis individually together able remember create meaning past present future event Boje Boje
These sequence used process structuring IT system development process IT system
Here narrative contributes establishing partnership common understanding player involved goal
This applies relation development presentation system user Gazan
Stories work several level also provide template gathering analysing empirical data
This happens interview situation need determine system requirement
The developer focus user story existing future practice analyse thus become aware requirement Alvarez Urla
These requirement later described narrative scenario easy relate easy remember
The scenario draw ability create meaning individually together arrange concentrate information narrative form Carroll
Subsequently story used analyse process mistake occurred political implication development implementation process Brown Brown Jones
To describe user persona help designer engage user entire design process
It enables design team engage user focus design user
But description conflict preconceived perception designer stereotypical image
When encounter stranger tendency see person stereotype
We see person possessing unique constellation characteristic add previously formed category Macrae Bodenhausen
The stereotype built knowledge previous meeting others ordered category form basis stereotype
One definition stereotype socially constructed representation category people Hinton
The stereotype function mental picture designer stereotype prevent identification described person
The description thereby influence value scenario mean investigate describe possible future solution
To move designer away stereotyping get engage persona put demand description
The field data persona traditionally focused behaviour demographic Goodwin goal task environment Carroll
Cooper et al
list three type included persona description experience goal end goal life goal
To collect field data engaging persona demand awareness kind information background psychology emotion character trait
Within field HCI ethnographic material collected interpreted communicated act communicating data design team often overlooked
The foundation document Pruitt Adlin example recommendation included material support persona choice material reflect process perceiving material
The creative process writing engaging persona grounded writer previous experience field data
To introduce field data designer act communication involves selection data present selecting form presented
During presentation presenter must aware data received interpreted
As human being tendency categorize person aware adding information work tendency might prevent designer conceiving stereotype
INT
THELMA S KITCHEN MORNING THELMA housewife
It morning slamming coffee cup breakfast table kitchen sink full dirty breakfast dish stuff left last night dinner soak
She still nightgown
The TV ON
From kitchen see incomplete wallpapering project going dining room obvious attempt Thelma
Beginning film script Thelma Louise Khouri
But engage designer
And persona description evoke empathy
In following I present framework emanates theoretical understanding fictional engaging character character building writing
Furthermore encompasses element character description include reading process engage character reader comprehend written description human complete
Take look excerpt beginning film script
The description Thelma quite vivid line tell reader state mind unhappy status housewife character trait sloppy
The character perspective fiction commonality persona description narrator withdrawn invisible
The invisible narrator also seen script example description Thelma seen specific perspective neutral author comment scene describing detail say something Thelma surroundings
The persona scenario function similar function character film script description character understand character action action character action move story forward
To create engaging persona provide reader vivid description user vivid reader user throughout design process
The term identification cover process recognition alignment allegiance Smith
The engagement first foremost provided ability recognize recognition originates material presented reader knowledge go beyond
The material presented le reader draw experience
What presented reader description persona reader must create inference added story speak
To enable engagement character description emotion well alignment allegiance derived material
From reader description persona certain demand engaging persona part scenario narration generates demand character description
In order designer reader engage persona text must give access To reader viewer fiction two basic type story well known
The story seen action film hero story move one action next
The character defined flat character
In contrast story character described several trait development character move story forward
This character defined rounded character
The difference character story number trait
In story character limited number trait function catalyst action
This make character highly predictable creates flat character story Chatman
In character driven story character multiple trait
The tension character trait creates unpredictable action determines story development
A description human include physiognomic dimension well sociological psychological dimension
Each impact character behaviour action
The description physiognomy sociology psychology enable understanding motivation behind persona action scenario
The dimension encompass past present self relation others
If understand three dimension provide reason every phase human conduct easy u write character trace motivation Egri
Thus character posse personal inner social public professional element
It diversity experience constitute character
All character personal need goal well interpersonal wish professional ambition
These help define character create demand restriction privilege
This well understanding rounded character several implication creation persona description The persona description characterised Furthermore persona belongs specific time specific culture interacts culture persona develops scenario
The understanding rounded engaging character put demand data field study
Observations work process segmentation user skilled versus user provide writer necessary information describe character trait psychology persona
As rounded character incorporates personality emotion action element also stem field data
During research information user surroundings character trait emotional status background well common demographic action goal task observed
The move creating engaging persona scenario reflects move static character description active character story narrative
In following I draw understanding narrative process mental story construction product performance text Ryan Boje
There discussion narrative agreed includes time way human organize time
Is narrative barest organization time suggested Abbott
She took bicycle
Or include causality suggested Cobley
She took bike hit bus
I participate discussion take pragmatic standpoint scenario point view
In scenario narrative must include causality focus relationship user action give rise system reaction system action provokes user reaction
There distinction narrative story
The narrative organization event story includes prior event event reader must assume guess
A movement start point end point digression involves showing telling story event
Narrative event chiefly space time
All event depicted narrative connected mean plot Cobley
For text broadest sense word qualify narrative must Ryan When experience incident try understand extract meaning incident
This meaning either construction story sequence organised narrative linear structure meaning organised logical structure Bruner
When read scenario similar process begin
We handed story element make u put together narrative
Some information receive story element inferred expectation knowledge area cultural background
The creation narrative process constructed reader presumption inference
An example The woman take knife
The man hit woman
We infer causal connection two element action assume two action spur action
The narrative becomes different presented reverse order example The man hit woman
The woman take knife
In IT system development persona description used foundation outlining scenario investigates use IT system particular user point view
The persona method author suggest different type
Cooper et al
suggest progression initial scenario detailed one increasing interaction
In order describe progression distinguish story problem exists prior introduction technology convey new vision situation introduction technology
Pruitt Adlin refer Whitney Quesenbery Quesenbery definition different type persona scenario different level detail placed continuum evocative prescriptive scenario well along development process
Mulder Yaar focus exclusively web development propose one type scenario describes persona journey website
The author provide different list element included complete good scenario
Below presented overview author scenario element propose scenario element definition give definition given Madsen Nielsen An overview various scenario element according different author
The table show list scenario element somewhat similar also Quesenbery Mulder Yaar explain element included scenario brief manner
Mulder Yaar state scenario element outline classic component storytelling
However explain classic storytelling
In general persona literature clearly inspired explicitly refer narrative theory established knowledge base source already defined controversially discussed key concept story element
It relevant look closely narrative aspect draw explicitly narrative theory
Personas
Each persona description example situation act starting point scenario
In case
change kindergarten change address
Note case persona couple
Basically story includes setting goal plot solution
It evolves dramaturgy beginning middle end
For scenario dramatic element The creative part scenario construction crucial process field data evokes design idea
Whether writing drawing producing scenario take place shared setting act communication
The scenario explores creative situation compared productive notion Tolstoy writing Anna Karenina Vronsky Anna finally made love Vronsky returned lodging Tolstoy discovered amazement Vronsky prepared commit Abbott It acquaintance Tolstoy Vronsky character narrative provides action
In instance reflects circumstance trait character story act motor provide description solution also carry writer away
As creative process ability becomes necessary producer scenario look consistency closure description persona scenario
In word producer need look upon scenario reader point view try understand story outside reader might understand
Events essential story
A narrative made constituent event necessary story supplementary event seem essential add flavour enrich story Abbott
Setting another common ingredient story
The setting optional took bike run bus include setting scenario setting inevitable
It setting pinpoint use take place surroundings may influence use time day element context might influence use
Dorte sits computer ready handle reporting
She go look front page
Dorte try take
It new thus little daunting least look nice colour think time saying What I I installed signature
I need find reporting Well look middle page search box maybe I try searching Dorte writes Apprentice refund search field launch search
A new screen appears short list hit
At top link form wanted
Excerpt scenario If look scenario setting known persona description
The scenario includes following event These event lay foundation system design
When narrative resolve conflict achieves closure Abbott
Closure single event whole story
Resolution one way obtaining closure
When read story want closure get answer question experience end
We desire end
As Brooks put narrative desire ultimately inexorably desire end Brooks
As write scenario know end desire find end creative process
During discussion writing ending created scenario agenda dialogue
Scenario reading differs scenario writing
As natural cause reading process closure resolution craved
If provided reader make Abbott scenario example reader depicts Dorte setting office sitting laptop front television
If scenario provide information reader make setting urge obtain closure
The voice hear either first person narrator third person narrator
The first person narrator I took bicycle limited view person third person narrator took bicycle possibility include comment person know took bicycle know evil person put track trace
Some suggest use first person narrator
Mikkelson Lee
Even though provides information language used persona downside bigger
The possibility adding omnipotent comment scenario ruled function container information accessible persona
If dealing scenario persona difficult distinguish one character use I
Furthermore take skilled writer imitate create consistent language
This experienced scenario excerpt dialogue extensive subtle dialogue
Plot inevitable story linking event plot keep story moving Cobley
Both story include action separate depth persona portrait
In story character seen personage rather somebody product plot participating story development
Instead character development creates story development story development spin plot
If designer engage persona scenario include strong central character goal desire need fulfilment story thus resembling story
Understanding obstacle user using product essential order develop redesign product
Often obstacle become visible collection data stem system surroundings
If look excerpt scenario Dorte obstacle installing digital signature examined
It installed signature story begin point
But likely need help son first digital reporting
You often see scenario especially IT giving persona IT system solves problem
I call type scenario happy scenario always happy ending
They lack obstacle solution always IT product make everything much easier
When read type scenario seem unrealistic lack obstacle
The overview inspired Jean Mandler reflection story form Mandler
The story begin setting character location problem time presented
After presentation one episode follow beginning development towards goal
In opening episode character reacts introductory event set goal outline path reach goal
Each episode focus goal attempt reach goal obstacle way reaching goal
The attempt understood cause outcome
Each episode link overall story thereby building plot
An overview story form translation hereof scenario context Madsen Nielsen To sum benefit scenario specific use language easily understood accessible user designer
This contrast model require knowledge expertise order understood
The scenario enables design process focused explains vividly
The scenario enables understanding experience likely result successful accomplishment offer decomposition Sutcliffe Bliss Jarke Kyng
This overview suggests shared understanding scenario method mean provoke discussion generate idea specific language easily shared user designer
It enables experience shared anchor empirical data specific form
The downside scenario confirm belief create obsession detail create false reassurance hard know design area covered
The downside also lack clarity evidence field data lack focus user
The benefit scenario Bødker Bødker Christiansen Carroll Carroll Erickson Sutcliffe
The downside scenario Grudin Pruitt Mikkelson Lee Nardi Nielsen Sutcliffe
Alan Cooper link persona scenario
He describes scenario investigation task
A scenario concise description user using product achieve goal Ibid goal stem persona description
Even though seems natural link persona scenario often viewed separate method
In Forrester claimed redesign persona provide return investment four time Drego Dorsey
In later study demonstrated number area affect success method Browne
The criterion success Reported failure seem due Similar study carried Denmark Vorre Hansen
These study showed difference consultant agency development agency lens collect analyse data
motif barrier product use shared value sender recipient
For development specific value seem present
One finding interviewed study assessed persona checked regularly updated necessary every year
The interviewed judged value method well challenge
From study pattern company use method appeared
Personas used variety purpose different value A number challenge reported especially following area In book Personas User Focused Design Nielsen I asked UX professional Australia Brazil Finland India Russia UK give short overview status persona use country
The common experience often large company driver bank newspaper insurance company government body
Some company report product design Japan India use still seems within area
Few company develop method many refer Alan Cooper design method
The Russian UIDesign Group translate define term persona Russian started developed method strong focus use persona requirement gathering
Around globe seems uniform format description photo short description individual character
While company report use method still infancy Daishinsha Japan used method product since following introduction Forrester research Alan Cooper
As seen persona method uniform method used different way
With shift method used IT system design include area marketing communication method constantly evolving
Some company fully understand potential method design method instead devise marketing archetype call persona
I hope future much focus use scenario better understanding data collection part proper persona description
One constant persona method far focus user including user design process seen participatory design see
Ned Koch chapter
In following I present novel way using persona innovation ideation user involved design process persona part scenario user
Furthermore I present experiment actor acting persona help designer become immersed understand daily life persona enactment
Arla Foods leading dairy company Scandinavia wanted innovate within unknown area canteen
For purpose creating new product user knowledge innovation process launched
It consisted scientific data gathering customer data gathering data analysis
From analysis two persona produced
The material used innovation workshop lasting two day
The participant use persona description various scenario come product idea based scenario
The innovating participant concept developer marketing manager engineer canteen manager
Even though canteen manager came second day workshop entered group without hesitation became engaged creative process
It easy relate persona description felt equal footing designer
This resulted twenty idea four picked development
Another case user innovating persona student session
This case one participant proved successful first industrial case
The aim develop tool could support communication soccer trainer child parent
Prior session data gathered observation focus group
From two persona different behaviour medium use created well number scenario varied situation context
The user asked go scenario point view two persona intention creating novel solution
The user explains moderator persona act given scenario
The participant mother child problem switching two persona even though one resembled
She able draw knowledge parent preference behaviour acted persona resembled often commented likeness would react need
The two case show user able act persona creative professional designer use understanding area focus create scenario perspective persona similar persona different familiar different behaviour within given design area
It also show user immediately able scenario alone together designer project participant
The use persona enables project participant discus understanding context need time allows user enter discussion expert relate innovation concrete knowledge culture work task
This way persona take focus away user single domain expert seen participatory design aligns designer user role innovator
A recent experiment show actor perform persona thereby enhance engagement understanding user
For website aimed citizen Denmark developed spring
The persona vary knowledge take citizen understanding public sector use competence within IT use digital
As experiment Line Mulvad producer actor took two persona description point departure male carpenter age single parent found reading long text difficult female healthcare assistant age originally Bosnia thus speaking Danish accent
From description producer two actor improvised series scene introduced persona character couple scenario showed problem using public website come understanding language woman understanding system
All filmed edited two small film app
minute length
The film dogma style camera actor talking camera gave authentic impression
The actor Jeppe Christoffersen play carpenter problem reading long text therefore want absolutely sure done right report digitally
The film shown audience following discussion showed almost felt got better understanding persona movie written description felt easier engage persona come design idea
Also spectator never felt watching actor convinced watching real user
A downside method second part movie incorporated scenario
The scenario gave film action plot present day scenario change redesign performed effect
In future test difference written persona description enacted description work incorporate action drama without focusing problem present day scenario
But using actor instead real user becomes possible focus exactly information problem want put forward
There book written persona many paper based single case study
Here overview book I come across

The whole team need buy concept persona
The easiest way ensure agree key attribute get everyone involved creating persona start
Now fake people sufficient designing whole product
As see persona create highly representative key user
Their value focus give
Rather trying thing people focus mean deliver streamlined product consistent message
What really interesting design although designing couple key individual vast majority user base likely share need least able work feature
So focusing clearly requirement small group user actually build better product customer

often abbreviated practice designing interactive digital product environment system service
Beyond digital aspect interaction design also useful creating physical product exploring user might interact
Common topic interaction design include
While interaction design interest form similar design field main area focus rest behavior
Rather analyzing thing interaction design synthesizes imago thing could
This element interaction design characterizes IxD design field opposed science engineering field
While discipline software engineering heavy focus designing technical stakeholder interaction design geared toward satisfying majority user
The term coined took year designer concept started take hold
To Verplank adaptation computer science term profession
To Moggridge improvement coined refer application industrial design product containing software
The earliest program design interactive technology Visible Language Workshop started MIT founded NYU Martin Elton later headed Red Burns
The first academic program officially named Interaction Design established Master Design Interaction Design
At outset program focused mainly screen interface shifting greater emphasis big picture aspect organization culture service system
In Gillian Crampton Smith founded Design MA RCA London changed Design Interactions headed Anthony Dunne
In Crampton Smith helped found small institute hometown Northern Italy dedicated solely interaction design
The institute moved Milan October merged
In people originally involved IDII set CIID
After Ivrea Crampton Smith Philip Tabor added Interaction Design IxD track Visual Multimedia Communication Iuav University Venice Italy
In founded Swedish research institute field interaction design
design design concerned satisfying need desire user product service
argues need new approach solving interactive problem
The problem designing computer interface fundamentally different include software hammer
Cooper introduces concept cognitive friction whereby anthropomorphize treat human product complex enough user always understand behave
Computer interface often qualify
Alternatively interface designed serve need provider
User need may poorly served approach
Usability answer question someone use interface
Jacob Nielsen describes usability quality attribute describes usable interface
Shneiderman proposes principle designing usable interface called Eight Golden Rules Interface Design well known heuristic creating usable system
archetype describe various goal observed behaviour pattern among user
A persona encapsulates critical behavioural data way designer stakeholder understand remember relate
Personas use storytelling engage user social emotional aspect allows designer either visualize best product behaviour see recommended design successful
The framework provides vocabulary evaluate modify design solution
Cognitive dimension offer lightweight approach analysis design quality rather detailed description
They provide common vocabulary discussing notation programming language design
Dimensions provide description interface user interacts example include
These concept aid creation new design existing one alter design within particular dimension
Designers must aware element influence user emotional response
For instance product must convey positive emotion avoiding negative one
Other important aspect include motivational learning creative social persuasive influence
One method help convey aspect example use dynamic icon animation sound help communicate creating sense interactivity
Interface aspect font color palette graphical layout influence acceptance
Studies showed affective aspect affect perception usability
Emotion pleasure theory exist explain interface response
These include model
The concept dimension interaction design introduced Moggridge book Crampton Smith wrote interaction design draw four existing design language
Silver later proposed fifth dimension behaviour
This dimension defines interaction word element user interact
Visual representation element interface user perceives may include limited typography diagram icon graphic
This dimension defines object space within user interact
The time user interacts interface
An example includes content change time sound video animation
Behaviour defines user respond interface

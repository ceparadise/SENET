In initiate action action INSERT DELETE UPDATE occurs
Since trigger specialized procedure stored managed DBMS
A trigger DBMS automatically fire trigger result data modification associated table
Triggers used maintain referential integrity data changing data systematic fashion
Each trigger attached single specified database
Triggers viewed similar consist procedural logic stored database level
Stored procedure however attached specific table trigger
Stored procedure explicitly executed invoking CALL procedure trigger implicitly executed
In addition trigger also execute stored procedure
A trigger also contain INSERT UPDATE DELETE logic within trigger fired data modification also cause another data modification thereby firing another trigger
A trigger contains data modification logic within called

What trigger used important system
Provide example situation trigger would appropriate
What would trigger look like
A trigger special kind stored procedure executes automatically whenever attempt made modify data table trigger protects
Triggers include statement
When attempt made insert update delete data table trigger particular action defined table trigger executes automatically
A trigger circumvented
Triggers used maintain data integrity return query result
The primary benefit trigger contain complex processing logic
You use trigger constraint provide functionality require
The following common reason use trigger cascade modification related word nature implementation style trigger

In action occurrence recognized software often originating external environment may software
Computer event generated triggered system user way
Typically event handled synchronously program flow software may one dedicated place event handled frequently
A source event includes user may interact software way example keystroke
Another source hardware device timer
Software also trigger set event event loop
communicate completion task
Software change behavior response event said often goal
Event driven system typically used asynchronous external activity need handled program example user press button mouse
An event driven system typically run keep waiting activity
input device internal alarm
When one occurs collect data event dispatch event software deal
A program choose ignore event may library dispatch event multiple handler may programmed particular event
The data associated event minimum specifies type event may include information occurred caused occur extra data provided event handler event processed
Events typically used user interface action outside world mouse click keyboard press message program etc
handled program series event
Programs written many windowing environment consist predominantly event handler
Events also used level complement
Compared interrupt event normally handled synchronously program explicitly wait event serviced typically calling instruction dispatch next event whereas interrupt demand service time
A common variant provided
This model based three entity Furthermore model requires us event special delegate fired class declares
This allows better example In computer programming handle input received program called
Each piece information underlying typically
GUI event include press movement action selection expiring
On lower level event represent availability new data reading file network stream
Event handler central concept
The event created framework based interpreting input may event
For example mouse movement click interpreted menu selection
The event initially originate action operating system level generated hardware device software interrupt instruction state change
On level correspond event handler
Created event first processed within framework
It typically manages association event event handler may queue event handler event later processing
Event dispatcher may call event handler directly wait event dequeued information handler executed
term used conjunction linking application generate small event application monitor associated condition may take action triggered event
Event notification important feature modern system used inform application condition watching occurred modern operating system used inform application take action refreshing window modern distributed system producer event might different machine consumer consumer
Event notification platform normally designed application producing event need know application consume even many application monitor event stream
It sometimes used synonym term relates one class product supporting event notification networked setting
The model sometimes used endow event notification system system stronger consistency guarantee
There large number situation event program system may generate respond
Some common user generated event include A generate number software recognisable
A mouse generate number mouse event mouse move including direction move distance mouse button motion combination gesture
Pressing key keyboard combination key generates keyboard event enabling program currently running respond introduced data user pressed
Moving generates analogue signal
They often multiple button trigger event
Some popular game box use joystick
The event generated using commonly referred
Device event include action device shake tilt rotation move etc

I object Java whose state change course time
When one field object reach certain value I want external event triggered
I know Swing handle pattern Listeners I using Swing project I sure kind Listener would apply case
The object state changed user Listeners seem triggered user action
The object I monitoring Swing component run background main thread
You might want look designed purpose
Here JavaWorld tutorial Observer Observable Whether state changed user really matter
You invoke listener callback method change state make sure state object could changed method Listeners seem triggered user action
Not always
For example change property many Swing component background font etc PropertyChangeEvent fired
I would suggest also use event
Read section Swing tutorial example

I following code HTML When run Firefox console I would expected clicked code would run synchronously respond click event event queue completed script
Instead I get clicked This suggests event handled synchronously
Yes synchronously run activation step includes immediately firing creating dispatching event
It put event loop queue

It common bank issue debt given certain term
For example one bank term could borrowing party incur debt term loan
Should borrower incur debt triggering event bank may foreclose loan increase original rate interest accordingly

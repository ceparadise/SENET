technique test designed include representative boundary value range
The idea come
Given set test system topology defined set
Those input belong defined theory would constitute
Given basis set would exist boundary
The test vector either side boundary called boundary value
In practice would require test vector ordered individual parameter follows kind order either
Formally boundary value defined Let set
Let assume ordering relation defined
Let two equivalent class
Assume test vector
If class value boundary value
In plainer English value minimum maximum edge tested
The value could input output range software component also internal implementation
Since boundary common location error result software frequently exercised
The expected input output value software component extracted component specification
The value grouped set identifiable boundary
Each set partition contains value expected processed component way
Partitioning test data range explained test case design technique
It important consider valid invalid partition designing test case
The demonstration done using function written
On basis code input vector partitioned
The block need cover overflow statement underflow statement neither
That give rise equivalent class code review
note fixed size hence We note input parameter integer hence exists
When compute equality get back value boundary inclusive pair valid combination underflow overflow would happen
On hand give pair invalid combination Overflow would occur
In way give pair invalid combination Underflow would occur
Boundary value drawn overflow case shown orange line right hand side figure
For another example input value month year expressed integer input parameter might following partition The boundary two partition place behavior application change real number
The boundary value minimum maximum value boundary
The number maximum number first partition number minimum value second partition boundary value
Test case created generate input output fall either side boundary result two case per boundary
The test case side boundary smallest increment possible component test integer input decimal place would
In example boundary value tested
Boundary value analysis require invalid partition
Take example heater turned temperature degree colder
There two partition temperature two boundary value tested
Where boundary value fall within invalid partition test case designed ensure software component handle value controlled manner
Boundary value analysis used throughout testing cycle equally applicable testing phase

EP Boundary Questions available

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
While I university homework I come across question asking boundary condition electric flux density charged conductor
However I seem stuck I realise I really know meaning condition
I always taken limit definite integral somehow I feel case
Searching online give explanation big word I ca catch onto condition required satisfied part boundary region set differential condition solved
Can anyone offer dumbed explanation
A boundary condition known value must true problem working
Example I sitting stop light light turn green I absolutely know vehicle start rest I accelerate green light
This boundary condition physic problem involving distance velocity acceleration time automobile I driving
Also note boundary condition usually used evaluate constant integration performing indefinite integral
As David White already stated A boundary condition equation give constraint problem want solve
So vehicle rest time boundary condition v Or grounded conducting sphere boundary condition vanishing potential grounded potential volume surface r R Or oscillating ended fixed string also two boundary condition It ca move end
v v
Also see quantitative description In physic deal relate function derivative solution equation unknown function
A type condition requirement place function
I present example mathematical detail important long grasp idea boundary condition
Suppose tube length L sealed end
Now imagine take needle inject substance diffuses described diffusion equation c x concentration substance c D c D constant
Now far write general solution describing disperse need specialise specific case get physically applicable answer
Remember tube sealed end mean flow substance either end tube zero
It turn proportional first derivative c concentration
So like zero end c x x c x x L To complete problem also describe concentration like initially case form c x since inject point
The big picture
In example imposing fact tube really domain function sealed end
Thank interest question

I understand equivalence testing work
How different boundary value testing
EC Testing number test item
value want test cost time test
Therefore group test item class item class suppose behave exactly
The theory need test one item make sure system work
Children ride bus free
Young people pay Adults Senior Citizen pay
Classes Cellphones run Java
run Java
But two possible browser FireFox Opera J model run FF K model run O
Classes Browser FF Phones Browser FF Phones Browser O Phones Browser O Phones There danger using EC Testing rarely mentioned testing book important remember
That mean test one value class ALL value class behave
Real world example mine cell phone certain Java Platform
They suppose work reality
So testing one value class good good enough
EC Testing good tool fool proof careful
If test case cheap fast like automation test test
BV Testing decide test value edge Class identified
The theory defect around edge class
Classes Boundary value Boundary value Boundary value Boundary value I test professional I taken course convinced defect hidden around edge class
And I never seen study prof case
The fact need use BV Testing prof EC Testing flawed since test one value class
It easy use using value like integer
But boundary value class phone model browser version
The boundary value class often based specification system work
This good well system contain boundary explained spec need look

many character I put test field system fails break
big data file become slow read get annoying
Pasting one million character text area FireFox win crash ReCaptcha limit character system handle pass back somebody put character field
Or break EC Testing BV Testing great tool use perfect expect find defect using
Use system intelligence intuition try item look way could fail
And look hidden boundary
Boundary value analysis simply mean select value near boundary class
So still dividing input domain according class instead selecting value middle class use value boundary
For example input condition range three class input boundary value analysis select input
This type analysis pick error boundary
The Equivalence testing need supplemented Boundary value testing
For example equivalent testing function take value say month year partition would For equivalence testing enough pick one value test input partition class
That would mean test value would considered enough test behavior function
But value catch occur quite often
With boundary value testing test input would boundary would catch error
I see testing method complement
Boundary value analysis part subset equivalence partitioning
In boundary value analysis instead random value value boundary selected
Dynamic Testing Types Specification Based testing Equivalance Partitioning Structural Based testing A
Test Coverage B
Code coverage Statement coverage Decision coverage Experience Based Testing A
Error testing Exploratory Testing Equivalance Partitioning It technique tester divide test condition group set
System handle equivalently hence called equivalence class
To test one condition partition work assume condition work partition

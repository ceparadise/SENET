The cyclic redundancy check CRC technique used detect error digital data
CRC hash function detects accidental change raw computer data commonly used digital telecommunication network storage device hard disk drive
This technique invented Wesley Peterson developed CCITT Comit√© Consultatif International Telegraphique et Telephonique
Cyclic redundancy check quite simple implement hardware easily analyzed mathematically
It one better technique detecting common transmission error
It based binary division also called polynomial code checksum
In cyclic redundancy check fixed number check bit often called checksum appended message need transmitted
The data receiver receive data inspect check bit error
Mathematically data receiver check check value attached finding remainder polynomial division content transmitted
If seems error occurred negative acknowledgement transmitted asking data retransmission
A cyclic redundancy check also applied storage device like hard disk
In case check bit allocated block hard disk
When corrupt incomplete file read computer cyclic redundancy error reported
This could another storage device
The common reason error include system crash incomplete corrupt file file lot bug
CRC polynomial design depend length block protected error protection feature resource CRC implementation performance

Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part

I written algorithm find shortest path directed cyclic graph
I trying modify find longest path graph
My attempt write I change weight per edge making negative instead positive heuristic function
I seem trouble getting
It pretty good finding longest path sometimes guaranteed
It seems problem lie heuristic shortest path norm good optimistic way get head towards goal longest path I want heuristic point path goal continue increase total length
If I set heuristic return Dijkstra search le predictable incentive search node away using negative weight per edge
I think I keep weight positive try maximize score instead minimize may work I attempting without changing algorithm edge weight heurstic
I found similar post stackExchange answer specific question Can done Is setting weight negative right thing Is way set heuristic zero keep weight positive try maximize score instead minimize
First bear mind Longest Path Problem LPP problem whereas finding Shortest Path Problem SPP problem known The proof LPP trivial consists reduction Hamiltonian Circuit HC problem already known
In word could find sense modification taking polynomial time modify solve LPP problem would actually make nice discovery
This say used expected take longer
I recently paper two people
This problem stated follows Given graph G V E natural number T find path vertex V whose cost length case unary cost close possible given target value T
Obviously seeking longest path arbitrary pair vertex
If addition looking longest path join vertex
You verify O whether length equal number vertex
If found Hamiltonian path
Regarding question Certainly yes indeed modified get implementation Target Value Search problem used solve variant expect fast solving SPP
As matter fact provided simple modification A used solve LPP well certainly complete terribly inefficient Well real problem need heuristic function return upper bound path goal instead lower bound solving SPP sort heuristic seem particularly hard derive would
concept maybe constraint problem derive heuristic Well approach
Note approach force consider path
Even find path seems large still forced expand node OPEN CLOSE
In absence heuristic
This indeed variant Target Value Search problem efficient even solve LPP

Understand eight distinct characteristic research
According Leedy colleague eight characteristic research
First research originates question problem
Second research requires clear articulation goal
Third research follows specific plan procedure
Fourth research usually divide principal problem manageable
Fifth research guided specific research problem question hypothesis
Six research accepts certain critical assumption
Seven assumption underlying theory idea world work
Eight research requires collection interpretation data attempting resolve problem initiated research
This process often considered cyclical nature
For example action research AR known iterative nature Greenwood Levin cited http wherein research go cycle planning acting observing reflecting returning planning
This process involves critical thinking level decision making
For example one study called Just Between You Me report following cycle throughout project beginning planning recruitment evaluation acting upon plan observing reflecting outcome moving curriculum development program delivery
These author report evaluation process especially reflects cyclical nature action research using continuous feedback process throughout
Some AR practitioner call type cycle learning Hall cited http reflecting incorporation learning developed research To understand eight distinct characteristic research solution describes relationship eight distinct characteristic research

I looking longest simple path directed cyclic weighted graph positive negative weight
In research far I found need generate graph run shortest path algorithm find longest path
Of course wo work contains negative cycle
But excatly I need
Consider following graph I created quickly The red letter identification
The red number value vertex blue number edge weight
The edge weight generated following formula Weight destination source I looking longest path longest path
That mean vertex must visited
By simply looking I see
But I tried generate run algorithm would fail would negative cycle like
I aware possible look path vertex visited
But look simple path still possible
Longest Path reduction Hamiltonian Path almost trivial
That mean know algorithm even polynomial
You
Of course problem easier special class graph instance

How detect directed graph cyclic
I thought using breadth first search I sure
Any idea
Usually search used instead
In spanning tree built order visiting
If ancestor node tree visited
created detect cycle
See detailed explanation
What really need I believe topological sorting algorithm like one described If directed graph cycle algorithm fail
The I seen far seem missing fact graph may one way get node X node Y without directed cycle graph
Use DFS search path cyclic level assignment detect cycle
eg consider graph
B C D E F E G D As perform DFS start assigning level node visit root
level node
So recursion reach D
Dont mark level G G already level assigned grater E Now E also edge So levelization would say D get level
But D already lower level assigned
Thus time attempt assign level number node DFS already lower level number set know directed graph use color
white gray black
color white node white node gray go DFS color gray node black recursion unfolds child processed
child yet processed hit gray node thats cycle
eg white begin direct graph
color A B D F G colored
G leaf child processed color gray black
recursion unfolds F child processed color black
reach D D unprocessed child color E gray G already colored black dont go
E also edge D still processing D D still gray find edge back D gray node cycle detected
Testing Topological sort given graph lead solution
If algorithm topsort edge always directed one way fails mean graph contains cycle
Another simple solution would approach
Basically node tree flag visited move child
If ever see node visted flag set know cycle
If modifying graph include visited bit possible set node pointer used instead
To flag node visited place pointer set
If pointer already set cycle

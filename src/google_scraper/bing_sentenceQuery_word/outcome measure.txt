I recently started course data compression university
However I find use term entropy applies computer science rather ambiguous
As far I tell roughly translates randomness system structure
What proper definition computer science entropy
Entropy mean different thing In computing entropy randomness collected operating system application use cryptography us require random data
This randomness often collected hardware source either one mouse movement specially provided randomness generator
In information theory entropy measure uncertainty associated random variable
The term context usually refers Shannon entropy quantifies sense expected value information contained message usually unit bit
Equivalently Shannon entropy measure average information content one missing one know value random variable Entropy data compression may denote randomness data inputing compression algorithm
The entropy lesser compression ratio
That mean random text lesser compress
Shannon entropy represents absolute limit best possible lossless compression communication treating message encoded sequence independent random variable Shannon source coding theorem show limit average length shortest possible representation encode message given alphabet entropy divided logarithm number symbol target alphabet
My favorite definition practical focus found Chapter excellent book Andrew Hunt David Thomas While software development immune almost physical law entropy hit u hard
Entropy term physic refers amount disorder system
Unfortunately law thermodynamics guarantee entropy universe tends toward maximum
When disorder increase software programmer call software rot
There many factor contribute software rot
The important one seems psychology culture work project
Even team one project psychology delicate thing
Despite best laid plan best people project still experience ruin decay lifetime
Yet project despite enormous difficulty constant setback successfully fight tendency toward disorder manage come pretty well
One broken window left unrepaired substantial length time instills inhabitant building sense sense power care building
So another window get broken
People start littering
Graffiti appears
Serious structural damage begin
In relatively short space time building becomes damaged beyond owner desire fix sense abandonment becomes reality
The Broken Window Theory inspired police department New York major city crack small stuff order keep big stuff
It work keeping top broken window graffiti small infraction reduced serious crime level
Tip Do Live Broken Windows Do leave broken window bad design wrong decision poor code unrepaired
Fix one soon discovered
If insufficient time fix properly board
Perhaps comment offending code display Not Implemented message substitute dummy data instead
Take action prevent damage show top situation
Text taken I always encountered entropy sense Shannon Entropy
From In information theory entropy measure uncertainty associated random variable
The term context usually refers Shannon entropy quantifies sense expected value information contained message usually unit bit
Equivalently Shannon entropy measure average information content one missing one know value random variable
The information theoretic notion Entropy generalization physical notion
There many way describe Entropy
It measure randomness random variable
It also measure amount information random variable stochastic process contains
It also lower bound amount message compressed
And finally average number question need asked random entity determine value
Equation Entropy sample application probability calculation sum value rv probability value time log prob
p x logp x
This equation derived first principle property information
In term compression information theory entropy source average amount information bit symbol source convey
Informally speaking unlikely symbol surprise appearance brings
If source two symbol say equally likely symbol conveys amount information one bit
A source four equally likely symbol conveys two bit per symbol
For interesting example source three symbol first two twice likely third third surprising also le likely
There net entropy source calculated
You calculate entropy average surprise surprise symbol probability time negative binary log probability The negative binary log used course log value exclusive negative
The word entropy defined one sentence Imagine example expansion universe From beginning matter collected small point big bang could described system matter within one point
While today significantly information required describe system Universe one would need describe planetary position movement
In term information theory definition also work The letter add password system information needed describe password
Then measure different unit eg bit character like hello character entropy bit entropy charsize bit
From also come information way arrange information
If bit different way arranged
If talking password possible arrangement information bit longer going take cracking brute force dictionary attack
Here great alternate explanation information theory
Entropy measure
We also describe entropy would get outcome made initial prediction
Lets say bent coin give u head time tail time
Since one percent chance getting tail would surprised actually get tail
On hand wo surprising got head already percent chance getting head
let assume function called would give u amount surprise outcome average amount surprise probability distribution
This average amount surprise could also used measure uncertain
This uncertainty called
Entropy like hash code virus researcher well
Less entropy get would mean likely encrypted compressed code could potentially virus
A standard binary would higher entropy compressed encrypted one
Entropy many meaning typically Computer Science
It depends context
In security entropy mean much randomality place instance generate private key many application ask move mouse around generate entropy
This generates entropy taking human element randomality add hashing process generating key
Now also defnition software engineering entropy
This definition represents date code code many developer writing
Typically used reference near time refactor software project
The code project enourmous amount entropy many individual maintained project currently
Here third example usage I remembered
In topic simulated annealing far computer science concerned entropy described much decay happened evaluation algorithm
I guess answer question though concrete definition word except one find dictionary
How computer science tends apply term depends context term used applied
It easy make big deal entropy
To mind pretty
Basically quantifies average learn event like flipping coin taking branch instruction indexing array
Like comparison operation middle search algorithm certain probability P taking one branch taking
Suppose P binary search
Then take branch know bit log base
On hand take branch also learn bit
To get average amount information learn multiply learn first branch time probability take branch plus learn second branch time probability branch
time bit plus time bit bit plus bit total bit entropy
That expect learn average decision
On hand suppose linear search table entry
On first test probability YES entropy YES decision bit
So answer YES learn bit chance thousand
On hand NO much likely
It entropy roughly time roughly zero zero
Add two together average learn bit decision
That linear search slow
The entropy much expect learn decision small since going learn bit find entry table
Entropy computer science commonly refers random string bit
The following question making precise In simpler word Entropy defines randomness
like unpredictable something
In technical word computing entropy randomness collected operating system application use cryptography us require random data
This randomness often collected hardware source either one mouse movement specially provided randomness defined wikipedia
One easily conclude meaning entropy respect file measurement much disordered byte file
There various unit used defining entropy like nat shannon hartley
Well common unit used Shannon
The range value entropy must come per algorithm
So entropy value zero one say outcome certain
On contrary entropy value outcome unpredictable could
The formula given Shannon measure randomness outcome event event probability
This equation always result
For information go link In simple word know probability symbol langauge one compute average information content symbol language
Or The entropy language measure information content average symbol language Consider fair coin There two symbol probability entropy calculated h entropy refers extent software reshaped occasionally basing customer requirement hence cost reshaping meet customer reqrments becomes maximum
I heard people misuse thermodynamic definition entropy CS

Entropy definitely increasing system
When mean code getting worse worse

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

What role stack microprocessor
Stack used largely function call depending language level programming may used temporarily store processor register data variable
Further stack may also used storage data using store partial data stack call
The And yes stack also used
Its nature carrying called function return back coupled weakness check language give nice way cause stack vulnerable unsafely written program
At lowest level stack place certain instruction store retrieve data data stored interrupt occurs
Microprocesors vary general type instruction When processor interrupt occurs due external device CPU save current program counter usually flag register stack jump handling subroutine
This allows handling subroutine process interrupt return whatever CPU current state preserved
While microprocessor one stack active time operating system make appear multiple stack
At least one OS one process one thread
In fact thread may implement multiple stack
At higher level whatever language used implement thread often use stack purpose store functional call parameter local variable function call return value speaking broad stroke consult language documentation specific detail
Thus concludes explanation stack
In ancient time subroutine call handled word memory RAM subroutine indicate called
To call subroutine one would something like This pattern might optimized caller place return address register routine store return spot entry
This pattern worked problem
Not generally waste memory also mean dealing recursive code
Adding stack made possible simplify code caller simply say store return address someplace suitable without disturbing earlier one called function simply say return recent caller returned yet
This allowed development code meant necessary store enough return address handle deepest nested chain function call would ever actually occur
It depends microprocessor
Generally role keeping local variable function parameter
And actually microprocessor central memory
Stack used function call
Its put good use nested function call recursive function call
It also used
On microprocessor also used context switch
cheer Some microprocessor improve efficiency take look wikipedia others microstack microroutines
It wide term fact
The stack temporary store data
The CPU may PUSH important data onto stack processing data
When finish task PULLS saved data stack
Its like pile plate
The bottom plate first bit data pushed onto stack
The top plate last data pushed
The top plate pulled first bottom plate last data pulled
It LAST IN FIRST OUT stack
In diagram X first pushed Y lastly A
The CPU go away process data
Upon completion task return pull saved data
First A pulled Y lastly X
The instruction pushing data PHA
Only data accumulator pushed onto stack
Other data pushed transferred accumulator first
The instruction pulling data stack PLA
Data stack transferred accumulator
The stack consists byte occupies page address
Just add answer micros PIC line callstack mean dynamically allocated hardware
The implication go many function call deep run stack true software also course often hardware based stack limiting require rethink program order function call
A stack implementation LIFO Last In First Out buffer
The FIFO First In First Out also known queue
But back LIFO
Stacks architecture allow software designer dispense strange stuff return address register interrupt return address register found RISC processor
reside stack mean single standardized unified method handling variable return
The use method separate stack simplifies implementation
RISC contrast us buffer though keep significatnt part related info elsewhere
RISC stack may faster sure definitely difficult understand
Actually stack teminology processor used language routine call
A routine use stack get parameter save local variable also call routine

That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

A sequence one used specify boundary separate independent region data stream
An example delimiter character act sequence
Another example delimiter time gap used separate letter word transmission
Delimiters represent one various mean specify boundary
example alternate method us length field start data stream specify number character data stream contains
Delimiters broken Field delimiters separate data field
Record delimiters separate group field
For example CSV file format us comma delimiter indicator delimiter
For instance specifies simple using CSV file format
Bracket delimiters also called block delimiters region delimiters balanced delimiters mark start end region text
Common example bracket delimiters include Computing platform historically use certain delimiters convention
The following table depict example comparison


problem occurs author programmer introduces delimiters text without actually intending interpreted boundary separate region
In case XML example occur whenever author attempt specify character
In file type field delimiter record delimiter subject collision
In case file example field collision occur whenever author attempt include comma part field value salary record delimiter collision would occur whenever field contained multiple line
Both record field delimiter collision occur frequently text file
In context malicious user attacker may seek exploit problem intentionally
Consequently delimiter collision source security
Malicious user take advantage delimiter collision language deploy attack respectively
Because delimiter collision common problem various method avoiding invented
Some author may attempt avoid problem choosing delimiter character sequence character likely appear data stream
This approach may suitable necessarily depends correct guess appear data stream offer security malicious collision
Other formal convention therefore applied well
The ASCII Unicode character set designed solve problem provision character used delimiters
These range ASCII
The use ASCII field separator ASCII solves problem field record delimiters appear text data stream
One method avoiding delimiter collision use
From language design standpoint adequate drawback Escape sequence similar escape character except usually consist kind mnemonic instead single character
One use include doublequote character
For example code produce output One drawback escape sequence used people need memorize code represent individual character see also
In contrast escape sequence escape character dual delimiters provide yet another way avoid delimiter collision
Some language example allow use either single quote double quote specify string literal
For example produce desired output without requiring escape
This approach however work string contain type quotation mark
In contrast escape sequence escape character padding delimiters provide yet another way avoid delimiter collision
example us double quote delimiters
This similar escaping delimiter
produce desired output without requiring escape
Like regular escaping however become confusing many quote used
The code print source code would look confusing In contrast dual delimiters multiple delimiters even flexible avoiding delimiter collision
For example produce desired output use allow convenient character act delimiter
Although method flexible language support
Perl two
A special type delimiter specifically designed resist delimiter collision
It work allowing author specify sequence character guaranteed always indicate boundary part message possible interpretation
The delimiter frequently generated random sequence character statistically improbable occur content
This may followed identifying mark distinguishing mark
Alternatively content may scanned guarantee delimiter appear text
This may allow delimiter shorter simpler increase human readability document

Some programming computer language allow use mean specifying boundary independent region text
In specifying alternate delimiters may also used simplify syntax operation
For example simple match operation may specified Perl following syntax The syntax flexible enough specify match operation alternate delimiters making easy avoid delimiter collision A allows inclusion arbitrary content describing special end sequence
Many language support including
A document start describing end sequence continues sequence seen start new line
Here example perl This code would print By using special end sequence manner character allowed string
Although principally used mechanism text encoding binary data programming system administration technique also help avoid delimiter collision circumstance
This technique contrasted approach described complicated therefore suitable small application simple data storage format
The technique employ special encoding scheme ensure delimiter character appear transmitted data
This technique used example web development technology closely associated VIEWSTATE component system
The following simplified example demonstrates technique work practice
The first code fragment show simple VIEWSTATE value contains character incompatible delimiters HTML tag This first code fragment would therefore work properly real world deployed system
In contrast second code fragment show HTML tag except time incompatible character VIEWSTATE value removed application encoding A third code fragment show HTML tag except time incompatible character VIEWSTATE value removed application This prevents delimiter collision ensures incompatible character appear inside HTML code regardless character appear original decoded text

I see language specifies reserved word delimiters whitespaces lexer section
Are delimiters like reserved identifier punctuation space additioinal function regarding skipping whitespace
Namely spec say Each lexical element either delimiter identifier may reserved word abstract literal character literal string literal bit string literal comment
In case explicit separator required separate adjacent lexical element namely without separation interpretation single lexical element possible
A separator either space character SPACE NBSP format effector end line
I also see definition delimiter
I understand difference
Moreover special character part I understand deliver character path parser
Anyway I wonder piece text smashed like
Mine current lexer produce followed identifier
However I feel others
What common practice lexing whitespace skipping whitespace mandatory optional
How specify
I ask see specify lot whitespace separator production rule
Despite stuff must ubequitos practice I see
In JavaCC instance rest
What convention
I see
What purpose
I guess I supplement every definition identifier delimiter literal optional whitespace prefix
Now right identifier literal separated delimiters whitespace
How I ensure
Now right identifier literal separated delimiters whitespace
How I ensure
If right mean case every programming language right probably lexical statement would either
In many language integer literal separated following identifier language
In language different identifier number class token require explicit separation
If consider delimiters say identifier need separated whitespace delimiters either since normally valid
Maximal munch common lexical algorithm
This view input sequence lexeme lexeme start precisely following previous lexeme continues far possible two lexeme possible given point source code longest one chosen regardless whether rest input would valid
Not lexeme token set lexeme includes ignorable whitespace example recognized tokeniser otherwise participate syntactic analysis
However language idiosyncratic exception
Consider handling D require explicit exception rule
A different issue handling literal ECMAscript language could tokenised simple operator token could first part regular expression literal
Which option chosen depends immediate syntactic context
Yet another deviation model found language like Python Haskell layout whitespace used indententation sometimes syntactic
To extent language specification us maximal munch algorithm whitespace mandatory context would produce different tokenisation
In language whitespace always discarded tokenisation need ensure supplied
There global institution regulates computer language designer
Each language community develops according philosophy custom eccentricity equivocation higher truth one appeal
Particular language may based different tokenisation model make general statement based behaviour single language
In comment stream suggested question actually applies VHDL VHDL conform maximal munch model
The text cited OP apparently come section VHDL Reference Manual
However seems clear even text quoted OP design much different
I repeat emphasis added The text design unit sequence separate lexical element
Each lexical element either delimiter identifier may reserved word abstract literal character literal string literal bit string literal comment
A separator either space character SPACE NBSP format effector end line
A space character SPACE NBSP separator except within comment string literal space character literal
So make clear case separation obligatory concatenated token could tokenised longer combined token essentially rule
As interesting example white space absolutely important Swift language
Take character match parsing rule operator
But binary unary operator unary bind left right
It depends white space White space left right left unary example x
White space right lift right unary example x invalid right unary minus operator
White space side neither side binary operator x x z x z x invalid

What semantics behind usage word delimiter terminator separator
For example I believe terminator would occur token separator token
Is delimiter either simply form delimiter
SO three tag yet synonym
Is truly different
Technically delimiter go thing perhaps order tell one field end another begin CSV file
A terminator go end something terminating
A separator delimiter anything else separate thing
Consider space word English language example
You could argue newline character line terminator delimiter line something separate two line
For reason different character Unicode specification
A delimiter denotes limit something start end
For example two delimiters happen character
The delimiters indicate part thing
A separator distinguishes two thing sequence The role separator demarcate two distinct entity distinguished
Note I say two computer science generally talking processing linear sequence character
A terminator indicates end sequence
In CSV could think newline terminating record one line separating one record next
Token boundary often denoted change syntax class would likely tokenised explicit delimiters token tokenizer would recognise change grammar class alpha punctuation character
The category completely distinct
For example could depending syntax list three item bracket delimit list terminates list mark end token
As SO use term tag tag indicate topic question
There single unified controlled vocabulary tag anyone enough karma add new tag
Enough difference terminology exist could never single controlled tag vocabulary across topic SO cover
A one two marker show start end something
They needed know long
We either pair A synonym delimiter experience usually refers
A field delimiter act divider one field one following though separating
A mark end group thing needed know long
The term delimiter separator originate classical idea storage conceptually comprised file many record record many field
In context single delimiter might called
Because historical significance taxonomy term widespread usage see Wikipedia page
Below two file three record record four field Here know single delimiters might also called respectively
For complex nested structure terminator also mutually exclusive definition
From previous example marker inside file could considered terminator
But look many file act like
Consider line UNIX file The newlines tell u string end tell u line begin end
From Two way view newlines newlines either separate line terminate line
Really need say terminator talking one individual item one string one line etc
unclear whether terminator context could also delimiter complex parent structure
Interesting question answer
To summarize delimiter mark limit something
beginning end terminator special term end delimiter separator entail item side unlike delimiter
Best example I think start delimiter marker programming language etc
Best example I think terminator end delimiter newline character Unix
It misnomer always terminates possibly empty line always start new line
last character file
Maybe better common example simple period sentence
Best example I think separator simple comma
Note comma never appears English without text
Interesting note none necessarily limited
In fact awk maybe gawk
Unix allows FS field separator regexp
Also although amount whitespace considered word delimiter
wc command also word boundary specifier regexps

Interesting ponder whether could considered delimiters well
I tend think much stretch
Terminators separator start empty
A B C actually A B C empty
This response context CSV provided answer focus English language instead
element mentioned given CSV specification describe boundary stuff common name field delimiters common name record delimiters
Delimiter part CSV format specification defines boundary printable character
Terminators separator field qualifier delimiters necessary specify CSV format
column delimiter mean column one value character line usually filled white space value character value etc
Terminator delimiter usually represented either Line Feed Carriage Return combination
mark end single CSV record
Separator delimiter represented printed character
semicolon mark division CSV field introduced store dynamic length value
CSV format specification without separator usually constant field length
Field qualifier delimiter usually used pair instead escape sequence printable character allowed field value unless given CSV format specification provides escape sequence mark beginning end field introduced store value containing separator
Escape sequence character set character mark anything follows escape sequence therefor part field value
backslash might specify immediately following separator part value
This sequence escape one multiple character

So I looking lambda calculus month simply trying understand numerical system successor function
I understand basically argument evaluation syntax confused longest time
Finally I found Î abc Î Î Î bc Î Î c Î c URL realized I understand worked
My question Is acceptable delimiter lambda calculus I verbalize writing viewing
Some people seem misunderstood let explain better
How I indicate function called specific set argument
For example programming language indicator parenthesis Is equivalent untyped lambda calculus
Okay still misunderstood I mean
Let talk successor function
The wikipedia page show something like following The marked whitespace annoying since It clear part parenthesis still part function instead look like argument passed function
Is delimiting character separate body function argument called
Example The problem I think I since function returned primary value syntax express clearly
However example I gave see three comma without trailing input indicating function take value function find successor successor potential argument
Is good convention express point function body end value need evaluated begin
VERY IMPORTANT EDIT So I think part problem resource using using standard lambda calculus notation
In text space argument
I would write z place x z
But assume convention variable always single letter omit space without ambiguity
But I ca imagine one would ever write whole program way
Rather likely show example code snippet small proof many variable name matter
Basically boil There delimiter space I know argument
Commas would frowned upon since indicate tuples rather curried argument
respond OPs edit There thing multiple argument untyped lambda calculus least standard one
There two way simulate function
It turn two basically isomorphic much matter
Some language like Scheme built syntax function I seen anything like formal lambda calculus
Usually intended minimal need function put
People use number convenient abbreviation make bit harder beginner figure going
I use abbreviation
Since asking basic question difficult guess exactly confusion lie
I answer broadly probably necessary make sure get answer also benefit others
It historic accident write text left right straight line
We used devised way representing data naturally linear linear fashion
For example arithmetic expression naturally viewed tree arithmetical expression
We way writing line Here another way writing expression That space important
The font important
The process converting string symbol corresponding tree known
In exactly
Expressions really tree would much better draw tree impractical
So write straight line
The syntax least basic version simple
It simpler arithmetical expression even simper programming language people use practice
Spaces matter
There precisely three way create expression It variable say x z similar
The letter variable used another purpose
If two expression say A B juxtapose place parenthesis around get A B
It matter much space A B
This called
If expression A variable x write x A get expression
It matter much space x
The period x A irrelevant visual embellishment
This called
It may help see example
The expression wrote written without abbreviation omitted parenthesis I hope I got right
As tree You understand picture proceeding
We thing
We apply expression A expression B forming application A B
This way apply anything
We always apply exactly one thing exactly one argument
Nevertheless nest application get desired effect applying several thing
For instance application
It effect applying two argument
To see work suppose wanted function take two argument return first argument
This would To apply function double application The way think first get argument
It computes result
Then applied second argument computes result
If want apply three thing write Without parenthesis using standard convention abbreviation written equivalently Keep mind apply three thing
Instead applied
Then applied
Then applied
This gave desired effect passing three thing
If wrote would applied one thing namely
This different
If wrote would applied effect like applying two argument
I tell whole story
I left concept bound variable I explain substitution work
But I hope clear misunderstanding

A general form specifies unique location
A path point file system location following directory tree hierarchy expressed path component separated delimiting character represent directory
The delimiting character commonly character colon though may use different
Paths used extensively represent relationship common modern operating system essential construction URLs
Resources represented either
Multics first introduced hierarchical file system directory separated
Around Unix introduced slash character directory separator
In first version Microsoft DOS released
support file directory
Also major portion utility command packaged came IBM command line syntax used slash character prefix
For example run command wide list format option
This use slash still found command interface Windows
By contrast Unix us dash character command line switch prefix
When directory support added version kept switch prefix character backwards compatibility
Microsoft chose backslash character directory separator look similar slash character
An path point location file system regardless current
To must include
By contrast path start given working directory avoiding need provide full absolute path
A considered relative path based current working directory
If working directory file result file addressed name
note also used reference root current user library current working directory respectively
When filesystems filename extension mounted
character changed example
note prefix may number boot volume AppleShare home directory Japanese Korean version Windows may often display character character instead directory separator
In case code backslash drawn character
Very early version replaced backslash glyph display make possible display program understood character square bracket replaced well see
Although even first version Windows supported character set Yen sign modern version Windows support Won sign much software continue display backslashes found ASCII file way preserve backwards compatibility
derivative UNIX us UNIX path internally
However preserve compatibility software familiarity user many portion GUI switch typed user internally switch back displaying filename entered user also changed inverse translation happen
The Microsoft Windows short specifies common syntax describe location network resource shared file directory printer
The UNC syntax Windows system generic form Microsoft often refers
Some Microsoft Windows interface also allow require UNC syntax share access rather URL
The UNC syntax extended optional component denote use SSL port number WebDAV URL becomes When viewed remotely SharedFolder may name different program server see opening
Instead SharedFolder name consists arbitrary name assigned folder defining sharing
Some Microsoft Windows interface also accept Long UNC Microsoft Windows us following type path In version Windows prior Windows XP APIs accept Long UNC could accept character
The allows path name character long
Since UNCs start two backslashes backslash also used string escaping result extreme case escaped string regular expression matching UNC begin backslashes string regular expression require escaping
This simplified using C Python regular expression literal Perl
Most system use similar syntax
allows treating path beginning two slash manner though case system must treat multiple slash single slash
Many application system example use resource definition like service name The following worked example discus behavior would appear terminal terminal application window Attached current working directory cwd One want change current working directory At moment desired represented short absolute path directory Given relative path directory wanted following may typed change current working directory bobapples Two dot point upwards indicate one dot represents current directory
Both component complex relative path alone first component relative path represents
Using refer file current working directory sometimes usefully distinguish resource found default directory mean example view specific version instead one installed system
Contrary popular belief accepts slash thus Unix example work
But many application Windows interpret slash purpose treat invalid character thus require enter backslash notably shell often called terminal typically run terminal window
Note many shell available Windows allow slash
In addition indicate single root instead root current disk
Indicating file disk current one requires prefixing drive letter colon
No ambiguity ensues colon valid character filename thus one file called A current directory
UNC name path starting support slash
The following example show path backslashes used match common syntax This path point file name located directory turn located root directory drive
This path refers file called located parent directory current directory drive
This path denotes file called located directory turn located directory located current directory current drive since example give
This rather simple path point file named located current directory since path lack current drive since drive specification present
This path refers first
This example us path containing slash directory separator
The command redirects content file command
A path containing forward slash often need surrounded double quote disambiguate
CD drive letter Files work root drive letter directory
This appears treat forward slash
For example work Also root folder would treated If relative path directory name specified forward slash get following error For setting environment variable sometimes necessary provide path contain space instance defined C cause script halt encounter space path name
To get name Windows assigns directory substitution environment variable use directory listing command option one level target directory
For instance following get eight character name directory directly root

A delimiter one separate text string
Common
When program store lot data may use delimiter separate data value
For example pipe delimiter program script could distinguish first last name string text
If writing script program delimited text recommend using uncommon delimiter
Using comma delimiter good chance getting split wrong place
If need use comma delimiter use two three comma instead one unless text name something comma
use strict example first last split example print Hello first see last name last nice meet In example code example contains text pipe delimiter split two new variable called first last
Once data split print output result
Hello John I see last name Doe nice meet
In Windows command line delimiters specified using option
For example indicates delimiter comma

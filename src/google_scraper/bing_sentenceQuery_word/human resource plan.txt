It also used refer department company responsible managing resource hiring training new employee overseeing benefit compensation package provided company employee
This term coined United States became greater concern business since spread around world
The people make company workforce human resource considered asset company like financial resource material resource building machinery equipment
A company likely successful manages resource well including people
This many company human resource department even though department directly contribute company production service sale profit
Rather effective HR department allow encourage company employee best turn contributes success company
One main role HR department managing current employee
Unlike manager directly oversee employee work HR department deal concern benefit pay company policy training
Among benefit might handled HR department insurance plan paid vacation paid leave illness health matter pension plan employee investment
The HR department also might settle conflict employee employee manager well grievance filed company employee
Human resource also involves acquisition new employee
HR worker might involved recruiting potential employee advertisement job fair
In case HR department try hire certain type people least ensure certain type people improve diversity company workforce
For example company might look candidate belong certain minority demographic
The HR department often collect review job application forwarding best applicant appropriate manager organization
The hiring process might also include background check credit check drug testing
After new employee hired HR department typically provides orientation including instruction company policy ensures employee properly trained job
A company HR department also play role employee leaf company reason

HR hard job
You face different people
My husband work factory push button day long
This something trained monkey I call worthless I know good job
Do judge others walked shoe day
I work HR put hour day job includes schedule time request benefit orientation onboarding monitor review wage increase counseling legal compliance investigation recruiting maintaining employee file ADA accommodation interviewing much
I get involved party planning celebration small part job
HR nothing actual job
They waste company valuable money
For one want work HR please rethink pull best real use company join
Do guy really want end sitting chair absolutely nothing throughout day
After employee reported first time get warning get fired automatically
How work
As professional social worker I get degree human resource
I hate HR staff
They often biggest waste money lot organization
All management ask timesheet human resource staff day account hour
This huge majority organization massively overstaffed human resource staff realistically little nothing day long surf net puzzle read book
For actually say give list realistically account tiny amount time add
They slack
HR staff dull
If intelligent would really HR
No
HR If real regular employee know HR big good idea tell management suggest aspect even streamlined right away
You save ten even hundred thousand process little loss
Because HR find hard lie timesheets easily isolate slacker useless one get rid promptly
When looking streamline organization get rid employee getting rid HR department first great idea obviously ca earn money
At least HR staff switched
Challenging accounting time least minute increment always great idea
Human resource staff grow like virus left unchecked
Once company even worse college public service get control try spawn employ human resource staff job
They usually claim extra necessary legal reason paperwork increased realistically often find still ca account time
It mask I want someone work If HR department level corporation turn hundred million year let HR get control take thousand organization every payday
In college Hampshire UK HR staff real employee
I like ask question In organization staff full time HR staff truthfully day long
The answer bit fat
The higher level HR staff delegate work HR staff staff generally rushed foot much work
And come application get worse
HR without doubt absolutely selecting people application let near
If charge sized organization worst thing human resource sift application
This HR staff blind ticker look actual talent people invent really make money
For example job application really much problem single person sift HR staff would believe take forever choose choose
This course utter crap

I earn company money year maybe much five regular employee put together
I know fact I gone HR I would even gotten interview I tick qualification box
When come job interview HR staff terrible
They simply present interview
Because ca actual work identify talent simply ask candidate preset question
Really skilled candidate pas unnoticed HR staff interested assessing character seeing intelligent well fit role
I hear endless sob story HR staff clueless
My Dad recently needed employ new staff member electronics circuit design job
He knew one people coming interview guy capable guy get past interview HR staff failed sort character My Dad kicked HR staff current future interview process never regretted
It us bit time spot possible talent otherwise would missed
HR staff ca trusted properly evaluate people job understand

A database intended organize store retrieve large amount data easily
Digital database managed using database management system store create maintain search data
Computer graphic study digital visual content involves synthesis manipulation image data
The study connected many field computer science including heavily applied field special effect
Research develops theory principle guideline user interface designer create satisfactory user experience desktop laptop mobile device
field study concerned constructing technique using computer analyze solve problem
In practical use typically application form problem various scientific discipline
Artificial intelligence AI aim required synthesize process environmental adaptation learning communication found human animal
From origin artificial intelligence research necessarily drawing area expertise
AI associated popular mind main field practical application embedded component area require computational understanding
The late question Can computer think
question remains effectively unanswered although still used ass computer output scale human intelligence
But automation evaluative predictive task increasingly successful substitute human monitoring intervention domain computer application involving complex data
Software engineering study designing implementing modifying software order ensure high quality affordable maintainable fast build
It systematic approach software design involving application engineering practice software
Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

The action event method technical process although abreast science still conceives danger even theoretically possible safety measure would applied scientifically conceivable measure word amount risk left natural reduced risk control
One approach scoring residual risk apply subjective judgement without applying mathematical relationship inherent risk level control effectiveness
A second method apply mathematical approach
The general formula calculate residual risk general concept risk alternatively severity probability
An example residual risk given use
Installation use reduces overall severity probability injury however probability injury remains use remainder residual risk
In economic context residual mean quantity left end process remainder In property right model shareholder hold residual risk therefore

The term residual risk mandatory risk management process according ISO unfortunately often used without appreciating real meaning concept
According residual risk risk remaining risk treatment
Here work first identify risk need mitigate risk find unacceptable
treat
Once treat risk completely eliminate risk simply possible therefore risk remain certain level residual risk
The point organization need know exactly whether planned treatment enough
Residual risk usually assessed way perform initial risk assessment use methodology assessment scale etc
What different need take account influence control mitigation method likelihood incident usually decreased sometimes even impact smaller
For information risk management process read
I mentioned purpose residual risk find whether planned treatment sufficient question would know sufficient
This concept acceptable level risk come play nothing else deciding much risk appetite organization word whether management think fine company operate environment much likely something happen management want higher level security involving lower level risk
Both approach allowed ISO organization decide appropriate circumstance budget
The former approach probably better startup company letter usually pursued financial organization
Once find residual risk
Basically three option
If level risk acceptable level risk nothing management need formally accept risk

If level risk acceptable level risk need find new better way mitigate risk also mean need reassess residual risk

If level risk acceptable level risk cost decreasing risk would higher impact need propose management accept high risk
Such systematic way ensures management involved reaching important decision nothing overlooked
So point top management need know risk company face even various mitigation method applied
After top management responsible bottom line company also viability

Residual risk also called inherent risk balance risk exposure identifying acting known threat
In word danger loss causing threat identified taken consideration
This portion eliminated management action first
The process minimize impact business may still leave company vulnerable exposed risk
This called inherent risk
This concept applies threat business also opportunity
Companies ass risk appetite see level risk comfortable taking
Banks example normally follow conservative path accept risk easy
company hand aggressive nature tend go riskier opportunity
After management identifies much risk willing take team analyzes opportunity everything think could go wrong cause company lose money
It impossible management identify every single threat course action
There always unforeseen consequence taking action always element risk associated unknown
The unknown risk resides afterward taking article
Let look example
The company transport high value good across country
It willing accept risk case damage
The risk response take insurance reduce financial impact case product damaged
The company may decide accept inherent risk insuring good full
The company manufacture item race time reach market first
Two test cycle required get green light delivery
The risk response test rehearsal thereby ensuring option open user acceptance first test
This way product early launch
Inherent risk gain opportunity created reach market first
The company trade commodity market
Fuel cost huge impact specific contract
The risk response agreement buyer From price time closing deal increase shared also gain case fuel price drop
Residual risk zero
Residual risk mean inherent danger opportunity left threat considered

Let answer simple word understand
A risk event occur may negatively affect achievement organization objective assuming control place
As name implies risk remains taking control account
We know risk eliminated completely control designed mitigate risk acceptable level
Fire production facility may catastrophic consequence organization
Management put place mitigate risk like installing fire extinguisher sprinkler preparing emergency evacuation plan etc
These control help reduce damage event fire way remove danger completely
What remains taking control account
We internal auditor evaluate adequacy effectiveness control order bring residual risk level accepted board
Residual risk risk even procedure followed correctly checking level risk still remains may materially affect financial statement
Inherent risk hand presence incorrect misleading information account due factor weak control

If ask people define risk often hear answer chance something bad happen
While common answer entirely accurate come managerial accounting business management
A better definition exposure anything may stop individual organization accomplishing objective
The key difference two definition risk associated negative event associated might stand way organization objective
A common cliché state risk reward
This often hold true even generalized saying risk movement
In everything risk
But enough know lookout risk aware exists
To manage risk effectively important understand different type risk deal
risk exists action precaution taken
Think personal level
You ca leave house without taking risk hurt falling meteor texting driver rabid raccoon
Depending live chance something might happen different risk
That risk inherent risk
Inherent risk handled one three way
First accept risk
This mean continue whatever action undertaking accept inherent risk come action
This time
You also share risk
This essentially insurance
When pay automobile liability insurance paying company share risk causing accident
If accident happens may still cost someone else sharing cost rather sharing risk bear cost
Finally could avoid action
Since inherent risk part something risk
But effective strategy think thing live
remaining risk associated course action precaution taken
Another personal example make clear
When drive car taking risk might cause accident
That inherent risk matter safe careful always exist
But take precaution help protect wearing seatbelt
If wear seatbelt still residual risk decreased inherent risk personal injury
All option mitigating inherent risk available residual risk
You accept
drive seatbelt knowing get accident still risk injury
Often deal residual risk
You also share residual risk
In auto insurance example know bit crazy driver may figure residual risk even precaution taken
By lowering deductible insurance increasing limit coverage sharing residual risk
An important note relates sharing residual risk ca share risk take le share
And course avoid residual risk driving simply driving
After discussing acceptance sharing residual risk avoiding might sound like best option
But residual risk fourth choice

To manage risk need aware objective associated risk
When identify much risk residual much risk want manage
You manage residual risk check balance control built process action may warn risk increasing changing
Let take business example
If factory produce widget want produce many widget sell
The inherent risk producing ANY widget wo sell
If accepted inherent risk would produce something sold
You would sell many widget way since buyer generally expect
To make sure always customer wanted could produce widget full capacity however widget produce residual risk acquire wasted inventory
To manage risk could set inventory goal sale projection update get information
In way accepting residual risk producing sold managing making sure amount risk optimized
In lesson discussed exposure anything may stop individual organization accomplishing objective
Specifically discussed risk exists precaution taken
When faced inherent risk accept share avoid
Then discussed risk still exists course action precaution taken
While also accept share avoid residual risk better option manage residual risk
This mean taking risk structure control place optimize risk take reward receive

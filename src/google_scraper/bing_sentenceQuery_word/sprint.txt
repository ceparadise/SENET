Hackathons tend specific focus include used application subject demographic group programmer
In case restriction type software created
The word hackathon word hack used sense exploratory programming alternate meaning
The term seems created independently developer marketing team usage first happened
OpenBSD apparent first use term referred cryptographic development event held June developer came together avoid legal problem caused export regulation cryptographic software
Since event occurred around world advance development generally University campus

Starting mid late hackathons became significantly widespread began increasingly viewed company way quickly develop new software technology locate new area innovation funding
Some major company born hackathons began project hackathon Disrupt conference acquired million
The software began project iPhoneDevCamp later renamed iOSDevCamp company whose engineer developed PhoneGap refocused around PhoneGap Nitobi bought undisclosed amount
Hackathons typically start one presentation event well specific subject
Then participant suggest idea form team based individual interest skill
Then main work hackathon begin last anywhere several hour several day
For hackathons last hour longer especially competitive one eating often informal participant often subsisting food like
Sometimes sleeping informal well participant sleeping
At end hackathons usually series demonstration group present result
To capture great idea often people post video demonstration blog result screenshots detail share link progress social medium suggest place open source code generally make possible people share learn possibly build idea generated initial work completed
There sometimes contest element well panel judge select winning team prize given
At many hackathons judge made organizer sponsor
At hackathons organized development community iOSDevCamp judge usually made peer colleague field

Dec unique visitor Software Development Conference A note reader As per request developed set feature allow reduce noise losing sight anything important
choosing topic interested
Some team use Sprint prepare product backlog infrastructure development environment CI server part Scrum
Is useful
Senior Coach Danube us Sprint way getting team started The idea simple take initial sprint called Sprint Zero Iteration Zero Inception Sprint etc following three goal And course make Sprint Zero short possible
In experience sprint short one week I recommend
Mark Woyna us Iteration Zero spike The planning team responsible producing deliverable end planning iteration With one team Peter Stevens Agile Coach Switzerland used Zero Sprint estimate important feature agree definition done rebuild confidence customer
Like others set iteration length shorter normal team
So Is Scrum
The iteration different length team norm result produce working tested software
Is useful
author chime I sneaking feeling someone pressed use Scrum something obvious business value start invented Oh Sprint Zero
get peasant pickax away doorstep
Scrum agrees Sprint become phrase misused describe planning occurs prior first sprint
also Danube finish conversation asking Sprint

What difference Scrum Agile Development
Are Sprint Iterations
Scrum one many iterative incremental agile software development method
You find detailed description process
In SCRUM methodology sprint basic unit development
Each sprint start planning meeting task sprint identified estimated commitment sprint goal made
A Sprint end review retrospective meeting progress reviewed lesson next sprint identified
During sprint team creates finished portion product
In Agile method iteration involves team working full software development cycle including planning requirement analysis design coding unit testing acceptance testing working product demonstrated stakeholder
So SCRUM sprint perform software development phase requirement analysis acceptance testing opinion say SCRUM sprint correspond AGILE iteration
As mentioned others Scrum iterative incremental agile software development method managing software project product application development
So Scrum fact type Agile approach used widely software development
So Scrum specific flavor Agile specifically referred agile project management framework
Also Scrum mainly two role inside
Role
Ancillary Role role It consists mainly three role
Scrum Master b
Product Owner c
Development Team
Ancillary Role The ancillary role Scrum team formal role infrequent involvement Scrum procession nonetheless must taken account
viz
Stakeholders Managers
Scrum Master There type meeting scrum Let know one need input
How Scrum fit Agile Development
While Agile methodology applied product development software industry industry well Scrum specific software development
Scrum methodology
It simply provides structure discipline framework Agile development
The whole project made series Sprints Sprint Cycles n Sprint duration
If denoted T Tn
Sprints could anywhere week
Sprints shorter week ideal used le frequently
At end Sprint functional working piece software produced user actually test
Original article SCRUM SCRUM type Agile approach
It Framework Methodology
It provide detailed instruction need done rather dependent team developing software
Because developing project know problem solved much left team essential case scrum
There team leader case assign task team member rather whole team address issue problem
It way everyone involved project right idea implementation project
The advantage scrum direction adjusted based completed work speculation prediction
Roles Involved Product Owner Scrum Master Team Members Agile Methodology Build Software application unpredictable nature Iterative incremental work cadence called sprint used methodology
Both Agile SCRUM follows system feature developed part sprint end sprint feature completed right coding testing integration product
A demonstration functionality provided owner end sprint feedback taken helpful next sprint
Manifesto Agile Development That value item right value item left
Agile Scrum term used project management
The Agile methodology employ incremental iterative work beat also called sprint
Scrum hand type agile approach used software development
Agile practice Scrum process following practice eXtreme Programming XP Kanban alternative process following Agile development practice
Waterfall methodology sequential design process
This mean eight stage conception initiation analysis design construction testing implementation maintenance completed developer move next step
As process sequential step completed developer go back previous step without scratching whole project starting beginning
room change error project outcome extensive plan must set beginning followed careful came disadvantage waterfall methodology
Instead sequential design process Agile methodology follows incremental approach
Developers start simplistic project design begin work small module
The work module done weekly monthly sprint end sprint project priority evaluated test run
These sprint allow bug discovered customer feedback incorporated design next sprint run
The process lack initial design step often criticized collaborative nature focus principle rather process
At outset I say Agile evolutionary methodology Unified Process focus Iterative Incremental Development IID
IID emphasizes iterative development construction phase actual coding incremental delivery
It would emphasize Requirements Analysis Inception Design Elaboration handled iteration
So Iteration mini project
In Agile take IDD bit adding reality like Team Collaboration Evolutionary Requirements Design etc
And SCRUM tool enable considering human factor building around Group principle
So Sprint mini project bettering pure IID model
So iteration implemented Agile way yes theoretically Sprints highlighting size iteration small delivery quick
I really differentiate Agile SCRUM I see SCRUM natural way putting Agile principle use

In also known name see integrated larger scene
Sprites originally invented method quickly compositing several image together using special hardware
As computer performance improved optimization became unnecessary term evolved refer specifically two dimensional image integrated scene
That figure generated either custom hardware software alone referred sprite
As graphic became prevalent term used describe technique whereby flat image seamlessly integrated complicated scene
A graphic image move within larger graphic
Animation software support sprite enables designer develop independent animated image combined larger animation
Typically sprite set rule define move behaves bump another sprite static object
In devised first processor capable generating sprite graphic
The Signetics video processor first used Radofin
The first PC capable generating sprite graphic Signetics referred object
The term sprite coined
During hardware speed low measured
Beside processor chip
Sprites rare video hardware today
The CPU instruct external chip fetch source image integrate main screen using channel
Calling external hardware instead using processor alone greatly improved graphic performance
Because processor occupied simple task transferring data one place another software run faster hardware provided certain innate ability program also smaller
Separate location memory used hold main display sprite
Some sprite engine could store small amount position register unchallenged CPU programmed update several time per frame
Software complicated strange addressing mode video ram
In early sprite method integrating unrelated appear part single bitmap
Many early graphic chip true spriting use capability sprite image integrated screen often priority control respect background graphic time video signal generated graphic chip
This improved performance greatly since sprite data need copied video memory order appear screen since spared programmer task save restore underlying graphic something otherwise needed programmer chose progressively update
The hardware implementation
For scanline appropriate scanlines sprite first copied number pixel limited memory bandwidth length horizontal retrace fast small multiple limiting sprite line costly size limit horizontal width combined
It may larger screen usually tile map cached tile set
For every pixel every sprite unit signal presence onto line every unit notice collision
Some sprite engine automatically reload sprite unit
The
To save register height sprite location texture zoom factor often limited
On system word size texel penalty unaligned read needed rotation
This lead limitation known implementation Many third party graphic card offered sprite capability
Sprite engine often scale badly starting flicker number sprite increase number sprite unit us designer chip implement unit bigger cache
Many popular lack support sprite hardware
The animated character bullet pointing cursor etc
mainly rendered exclusively part screen video memory
Hence term
Mainly two distinct technique used render sprite software depending display hardware characteristic No sprite engine implemented would cache sprite texels use instead
This would allow sprite arbitrary width
So blitter based hardware us unified model foreground background fixed flat sprite need special background engine
It provide scrolling background background
A similar discrimination known software rendering
A technique called dirty rectangle used redraw part changed since last repainted scrolling frame buffer used
On powerful whole flat redrawn completely
Prior popularizing true graphic late many game attempted imitate look variety sprite production method
These included More often refers partially transparent two dimensional animation mapped onto special plane scene
Unlike sprite plane always perpendicular axis emanating
The image scaled simulate rotated two dimensionally overlapped object viewed angle
This method also referred
Sprites create effective illusion When illusion work viewer notice sprite flat always face
Often sprite used depict phenomenon fire smoke small object small plant like blade grass special symbol like
The sprite illusion exposed video game quickly changing position camera keeping sprite center view
Sprites also used extensively commonly represented early game especially
An example extensive usage sprite create illusion game The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion whose main graphical feature ability display hundred thousand animated tree one time
Closer inspection tree reveals leaf fact sprite rotate along position user
The us sprite create appearance high number leaf
However fact revealed player actually examines tree rotates camera
Sprites also occasionally used tool movie
One example fire breathing effect designer utilized sprite simulate fire emanating surface demon
Small burst fire filmed front black background made transparent using
Many burst attached surface animated Balrog model mixed simulated smoke heat wave create illusion monster made fire
The term sprite often confused low resolution graphic drawn computer also known
However sprite graphic created imaginable source including dynamic even
Likewise pixel art created many purpose sprite video game background texture icon website display art comic
With advancement computer graphic improved power resolution actual pixel art sprite becoming increasingly infrequent outside handheld game system cell phone
Sprites typically used character moving object video game
They also used pointer writing letter screen
For moving object larger one extent sprite may sometimes scaled combined
one term used describe use sprite environment
In way billboard positioned face driver highway sprite always face camera
There performance advantage aesthetic advantage using billboarding
Most rendering engine process sprite much faster type object
So possible gain overall performance improvement substituting sprite object might normally modeled using texture mapped polygon
Aesthetically sprite sometimes desirable difficult polygon realistically reproduce phenomenon fire
In situation sprite provide attractive illusion
Some make sprite small image icon reduce number request browser make server
used select part composite image display different point page
If page image combined one image downloaded single request positioned CSS
Reducing number HTTP request make Web page load much faster
Sprites also made used various online digital artist usually train ability make complicated image using different computer program fun
Sprite Artists called either create Custom sprite use edit sprite Usually made artist ripped video game medium order create art comic animation
Major video game company rarely use term sprite general public
Some alternative used

Approaches coordinating work multiple scrum team larger organization include among others
Scrum iterative incremental framework managing product development
It defines flexible product development strategy development team work unit reach common goal challenge assumption traditional sequential approach product development enables team encouraging physical close online collaboration team member well daily communication among team member discipline involved
A key principle Scrum dual recognition customer change mind want need often called requirement volatility unpredictable predictive planned approach suited
As Scrum adopts problem fully understood defined front instead focusing maximize team ability deliver quickly respond emerging requirement adapt evolving technology change market condition
Many term used Scrum scrum master typically written leading capital Scrum Master conjoint word written ScrumMaster
To maintain encyclopedic tone however article us normal sentence case recognized mark
This occasionally seen written SCRUM
The word correct however likely arose due early paper Ken Schwaber capitalized SCRUM title
While term Scrum allowed lapse deemed owned wider community rather individual leading capital used word
Hirotaka Takeuchi introduced term scrum context article New New Product Development Game
Takeuchi Nonaka later argued The Knowledge Creating Company form organizational knowledge creation especially good bringing innovation continuously incrementally spirally
The author described new approach commercial product development would increase speed flexibility based case study manufacturing firm automotive photocopier printer
They called approach whole process performed one across multiple overlapping phase team try go distance unit passing ball back forth
In used restart play forward team interlock head attempt gain possession ball
In early used would become Scrum company Advanced Development Methods John Scumniotales Jeff McKenna developed similar approach Easel Corporation referring using single word Scrum
In Sutherland Schwaber jointly presented paper describing Scrum framework Business Object Design Implementation Workshop held part OOPSLA Austin Texas
Over following year Schwaber Sutherland collaborated combine experience evolving good develop became known Scrum
In Schwaber worked Mike Beedle describe method book
Scrum approach planning managing product development involves bringing authority level operation property certainty
In Schwaber others founded Scrum Alliance set accreditation series
Schwaber left Scrum Alliance late founded oversees parallel accreditation series
Since public document called defines sort official version Scrum occasionally revised
There three core role Scrum framework
These ideally deliver potentially shippable product increment every sprint
Together three role form scrum team
While many organization role involved defining delivering product Scrum defines three
The product owner represents product accountable ensuring team delivers value business
The product owner defines product term typically add based importance dependency
Scrum team one product owner
This role combined scrum master
The product owner focus business side product development spend majority time liaising stakeholder dictate team reach technical solution
This role equivalent role agile framework XP
Communication core responsibility product owner
The ability convey priority empathize team member stakeholder vital steer product development right direction
The product owner role bridge communication gap team stakeholder serving proxy stakeholder team team representative overall stakeholder community
As face team stakeholder following communication task product owner stakeholder Empathy key attribute product owner ability put one self another shoe
A product owner converse different stakeholder variety background job role objective
A product owner must able see different point view
To effective wise product owner know level detail audience need
The development team need thorough feedback specification build product expectation executive sponsor may need summary progress
Providing information necessary may lose stakeholder interest waste time
A direct mean communication preferred seasoned agile product owner
A product owner ability communicate effectively also enhanced skilled technique identify stakeholder need negotiate priority stakeholder interest collaborate developer ensure effective implementation requirement
The development team responsible delivering potentially shippable product increment every sprint sprint goal
The team three nine member carry task required build product increment analysis design development testing technical writing etc
Although several discipline represented team member referred generically
To avoid potential confusion refers programmer organization call member
The development team Scrum even though may interaction role outside team PMO
Scrum facilitated scrum master accountable removing impediment ability team deliver product goal deliverable
The scrum master traditional act buffer team distracting influence
The scrum master ensures Scrum framework followed
The scrum master help ensure team follows agreed process Scrum framework often facilitates key session encourages team improve
The role also referred team facilitator reinforce dual perspective
The core responsibility scrum master include limited One way scrum master role differs project manager latter may responsibility scrum master
Scrum formally recognise role project manager traditional command control tendency would cause difficulty
A sprint iteration basic unit development Scrum
The sprint effort restricted specific duration
The duration fixed advance sprint normally one week one month two week common
Each sprint start sprint planning event aim define sprint backlog identify work sprint make estimated forecast sprint goal
Each sprint end sprint review sprint retrospective review progress show stakeholder identify lesson improvement next sprint
Scrum emphasizes working product end sprint really done
In case software likely includes software fully integrated tested documented potentially shippable
At beginning sprint scrum team hold sprint planning event Each day sprint team hold daily scrum specific guideline Any impediment stumbling block risk issue delayed dependency assumption proved unfounded identified daily scrum captured scrum master displayed team scrum board shared risk board agreed person designated working toward resolution outside daily scrum
No detailed discussion happen daily scrum
At end sprint team hold two event sprint review sprint retrospective
At sprint review team Guidelines sprint review At sprint retrospective team Guidelines sprint retrospective The following activity commonly done although considered core part Scrum Backlog refinement called backlog grooming ongoing process reviewing product backlog item checking appropriately prioritised prepared way make clear executable team enter sprint via sprint planning activity
Product backlog item may broken multiple smaller one acceptance criterion may clarified dependency investigation preparatory work may identified agreed technical spike
Although originally core Scrum practice backlog refinement added scrum guide adopted way managing quality product backlog item entering sprint recommended investment team sprint capacity
The backlog also include technical debt also known design debt code debt
This concept software development reflects implied cost additional rework caused choosing easy solution instead using better approach would take longer
The product owner cancel sprint necessary
The product owner may input team scrum master management
For instance management may wish product owner cancel sprint external circumstance negate value sprint goal
If sprint abnormally terminated next step conduct new sprint planning reason termination reviewed
The product backlog comprises ordered list scrum team maintains
It consists must done successfully deliver viable product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item PBIs based consideration risk business value dependency size date needed
Items added backlog commonly written story format
The product backlog delivered ordered sequence delivered
It visible everyone may changed consent product owner ultimately responsible ordering product backlog item development team choose
The product backlog contains product owner assessment business value development team assessment development effort often always stated using
These estimate help product owner gauge timeline may influence ordering product backlog item example two feature business value product owner may schedule earlier delivery one lower development effort higher one higher development effort complex riskier want retire risk earlier
The product backlog business value product backlog item responsibility product owner
The size
estimated complexity effort item however determined development team contributes sizing story point estimated hour
There common misunderstanding allowed product backlog
By contrast Scrum neutral requirement technique
As Scrum primer state product backlog item articulated way clear sustainable
Contrary popular misunderstanding product backlog contain user story simply contains item
Those item expressed user story requirement approach group find useful
But whatever approach item focus delivering value customer
Scrum advocate role product owner assigned
The product owner responsible maximizing value product
The product owner gather input take feedback lobbied many people ultimately make call get built
The product backlog Typically product owner scrum team come together write everything must prioritized becomes content first block time meant focused work selected item accommodated within timeframe
The product backlog evolve new information surface product customer later sprint may address new work
The following item typically comprise product backlog feature bug technical work knowledge acquisition
A feature wanted bug unintended unwanted may necessarily something defective
An example technical work could run virus check developer workstation
An example knowledge acquisition could research Wordpress plugin library making selection
A product backlog simplest form merely list item work
Having rule work added removed ordered help whole team make better decision change product
The product owner prioritizes product backlog item based needed soonest
The team chooses item complete coming sprint
On scrum board team move item product backlog sprint backlog list item build
Conceptually ideal team select think accomplish top list unusual see practice team able take item list along top one selected
This normally happens time left within sprint accommodate work
Items top backlog item work first broken story suitable development team work
The backlog go le refined item
As Schwaber Beedle put The lower priority le detail barely make backlog item
As team work backlog must assumed change happens outside team learn new market opportunity take advantage competitor threat arise feedback customer change way product meant work
All new idea tend trigger team adapt backlog incorporate new knowledge
This part fundamental mindset agile team
The world change backlog never finished
The sprint backlog list work development team must address next sprint
The list derived scrum team progressively selecting product backlog item priority order top product backlog feel enough work fill sprint
The development team keep mind past performance assessing capacity new sprint use guide line much complete
The product backlog item may broken task development team
Tasks sprint backlog never assigned rather task signed team member needed according set priority skill team
This promotes development team developer
The sprint backlog property development team included estimate provided development team
Often accompanying task board used see change state task current sprint like progress done
Once sprint backlog committed additional work added sprint backlog except team
Once sprint delivered product backlog analyzed reprioritized necessary next set functionality selected next sprint
The increment potentially shippable increment PSI sum product backlog item completed sprint integrated work previous sprint
At end sprint increment must complete according scrum team definition done DoD fully functioning usable condition regardless whether product owner decides actually release
The following artifact commonly used although considered core part Scrum The sprint chart public displayed chart showing remaining work sprint backlog
Updated every day give simple view sprint progress
It also provides quick visualization reference
The horizontal axis sprint chart show day sprint vertical axis show amount work remaining day typically representing estimate hour work remaining
During sprint planning ideal burndown chart plotted
Then sprint member pick task sprint backlog work
At end day update remaining hour task completed
In way actual burndown chart updated day day
It confused
The release chart way team provide visibility track progress toward release
Updated end sprint show progress toward delivering forecast scope
The horizontal axis release chart show sprint release vertical axis show amount work completed end sprint typically representing cumulative story point work completed
Progress plotted line grows meet horizontal line represents forecast scope often shown forecast based progress date indicates much scope might completed given release date many sprint take complete given scope
The release chart make easy see much work completed much work added removed horizontal scope line move much work left done
The determine whether product backlog item complete
In many case DoD requires successful
The definition done may vary one scrum team another must consistent within one team
The total effort team capable sprint
The number derived evaluating work typically point completed last sprint
The collection historical velocity data guideline assisting team understanding much work likely achieve future sprint
A period used research concept create simple prototype
Spikes either planned take place sprint larger team spike might accepted one many sprint delivery objective
Spikes often introduced delivery large complex product backlog item order secure budget expand knowledge produce proof concept
The duration objective spike agreed product owner development team start
Unlike sprint commitment spike may may deliver tangible shippable valuable functionality
For example objective spike might successfully reach decision course action
The spike time necessarily objective delivered
Also called drone spike tracer bullet spike current architecture current technology set current set best practice result production quality code
It might narrow implementation functionality throwaway code
It production quality rest iteration build code
The name military origin make path bullet visible allowing correction
Often implementation shot layer application connecting single form input field prove layer connect expected
Scrum work le well following circumstance From business perspective Scrum many virtue one designed yield best business solution
However efficiency given organization vary widely largely dependent ability organization adhere implementation guideline article
Every company distinct organizational structure culture set business practice naturally amenable methodology others
Like agile method effective adoption Scrum supported wide range tool
Many company use universal tool spreadsheet build maintain artifact sprint backlog
There also proprietary software package either dedicated product development using Scrum framework support multiple product development approach including Scrum
Other organization implement Scrum without software tool maintain artifact form paper whiteboards sticky note
Scrum empirical approach like empirical process control underpinned three pillar transparency inspection adaptation
All work within Scrum framework visible responsible outcome process workflow progress etc
In order make thing visible scrum team need frequently inspect product developed well team working
With frequent inspection team spot work deviate outside acceptable limit adapt process product development
These three pillar require trust openness team following five value Scrum enable The hybridization Scrum software development methodology common Scrum cover whole therefore organization find need add additional process create comprehensive implementation
For example start product development organization commonly add process guidance business case requirement gathering prioritization initial design budget schedule forecasting
Various author community people use Scrum also suggested detailed technique apply adapt Scrum particular problem organization
Many refer methodological technique analogy architecture software
Such pattern extended Scrum outside software development domain Manufacturing Finance
Scrumban software production model based Scrum
Scrumban especially suited frequent unexpected work item programming error
In case sprint Scrum framework may perceived le benefit although Scrum daily event practice still applied depending team situation hand
Visualization work stage limitation simultaneous unfinished work defect familiar Kanban model
Using method team directed way allows minimum completion time work item programming error hand ensures team member constantly employed
To illustrate stage work team working space often use note large whiteboard
In case decentralized team software
The major difference Scrum Kanban Scrum work divided sprint last fixed amount time whereas Kanban flow work continuous
This visible work stage table Scrum emptied sprint whereas Kanban task marked table
Scrum focus team multifaceted whereas Kanban make specialized functional team possible
The scrum scrum technique operate Scrum scale multiple team working product allowing discus progress interdependency focusing coordinate delivering software especially area overlap integration
Depending cadence timing scrum scrum relevant daily scrum scrum team end designating one member ambassador participate scrum scrum ambassador team
Depending context ambassador may technical contributor team scrum master
Rather simply progress update scrum scrum focus team collectively working resolve mitigate accept risk impediment dependency assumption RIDAs identified
The scrum scrum track RIDAs via backlog risk board sometimes known initial resolved owned accepted mitigated typically lead greater coordination collaboration team
This run similar daily scrum ambassador answering following four question As commented Since I originally defined Scrum Scrums Ken Schwaber IDX working I definitively say Scrum Scrums meta Scrum
The Scrum Scrums I used responsible delivering working software team Definition Done end sprint release sprint
PatientKeeper delivered production four time per Sprint
delivers production time per Sprint
Hubspot delivers live software time day
The Scrum Scrums Master held accountable making work
So Scrum Scrums operational delivery mechanism
scrum LeSS product development framework extends Scrum scaling rule guideline without losing original purpose Scrum
There two level framework first LeSS level designed team second level known LeSS Huge introduces additional scaling element development hundred developer
Scaling Scrum start understanding able adopt standard real Scrum
Scrum requires examining purpose Scrum element figuring reach purpose staying within constraint standard Scrum rule
Bas Vodde evolved LeSS framework experience working product development especially telecom finance industry
It evolved taking Scrum trying many different experiment discover work
In experiment solidified LeSS framework rule
The intention LeSS descale organization complexity dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solution solving simpler way
Less role le management le organizational structure

Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
I think trying Scrum due talking sprint bit lost
One main concept continuous delivery end sprint iteration release working software
Working mean designed developed tested accepted deployed etc
The kind waterfall exactly approach present issue
The main one set plan whole design upfront probably realize design work start develop
This really brief introduction sample
If thinking sprint iterative incremental scrum please take look agile principlesand probably team three exactly need use Scrum

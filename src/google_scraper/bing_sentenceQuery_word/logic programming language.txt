cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

type largely based
Any program written logic set sentence logical form expressing fact rule problem domain
Major logic programming language family include ASP
In language rule written form read declaratively logical implication called rule called
Facts rule body written simplified form In simplest case clause called definite clause
However exist many extension simple case important one case condition body clause also negation atomic formula
Logic programming language include extension knowledge representation capability
In ASP Datalog logic program reading execution performed mean proof procedure model generator whose behaviour meant control programmer
However Prolog family language logic program also interpretation procedure Consider example following clause based example used illustrate programming language
As clause logic program used procedure test whether testing whether procedure find finding
Even fact procedural interpretation
For example clause used procedure show procedure find assigning
The declarative reading logic program used programmer verify correctness
Moreover technique also used transform logic program logically equivalent program efficient
In Prolog family logic programming language programmer also use known behaviour execution mechanism improve efficiency program
The use mathematical logic represent execute computer program also feature developed
However first proposal use form logic representing computer program made Cordell Green
This used axiomatization subset together representation relation compute relation simulating execution program LISP
Foster Elcock hand employed combination equation lambda calculus assertional programming language place constraint order operation performed
Logic programming present form traced back debate late early declarative versus procedural representation knowledge Artificial Intelligence
Advocates declarative representation notably working associated academic visitor
Advocates procedural representation mainly centered leadership
Although based proof method logic developed MIT first language emerge within proceduralist paradigm
Planner featured invocation procedural plan goal
assertion

The influential implementation Planner subset Planner called implemented
It used implement Winograd understanding program landmark time
To cope limited memory system time Planner used backtracking control structure one possible computation path stored time
Planner gave rise programming language Popler Conniver QLISP concurrent language Ether
Hayes Kowalski Edinburgh tried reconcile declarative approach knowledge representation Planner procedural approach
Hayes developed equational language Golux different procedure could obtained altering behavior theorem prover
Kowalski hand developed variant showed treat implication procedure
Kowalski collaborated Marseille developed idea design implementation programming language
The founded promote Logic Programming
Prolog gave rise programming language well variety language
Logic programming viewed controlled deduction
An important concept logic programming separation program logic component control component
With pure logic programming language logic component alone determines solution produced
The control component varied provide alternative way executing logic program
This notion captured slogan Logic represents logic program Control represents different strategy
In simplified propositional case logic program atomic goal contain variable backward reasoning determines constitutes search space solving goal
The goal root tree
Given node tree clause whose head match node exists set child node corresponding body clause
These child node grouped together
The alternative set child corresponding alternative way solving node grouped together
Any search strategy used search space
Prolog us sequential backtracking strategy one alternative one considered time
Other search strategy parallel search intelligent backtracking search find optimal solution also possible
In general case share variable strategy used choosing subgoal highly instantiated sufficiently instantiated one procedure applies
Such strategy used example
For practical application well application require reasoning artificial intelligence Horn clause logic program need extended normal logic program negative condition
A normal logic program form read declaratively logical implication atomic formula
The negation negative literal commonly referred implementation negative condition shown hold showing positive condition fails hold
For example Given goal finding something fly two candidate solution solve first subgoal namely
The second subgoal first candidate solution fails succeeds therefore succeeds
However The second subgoal second candidate solution succeeds fails therefore fails
Therefore solution goal
construct called thnot applied expression return value true evaluation expression fails
An equivalent operator normally modern implementation
It normally written goal proposition proved program
This operator differs negation logic negation fails variable bound atom succeeds case including unbound
This make Prolog reasoning always fails succeed binding depending whether initially bound note standard Prolog executes goal order
The logical status negation failure unresolved Keith Clark showed certain natural condition correct sometimes complete implementation classical negation respect completion program
Completion amount roughly regarding set program clause predicate left hand side say definition predicate iff mean
Writing completion also requires explicit use equality predicate inclusion set appropriate axiom equality
However implementation negation failure need definition without axiom equality
For example completion program The notion completion closely related McCarthy semantics default reasoning
As alternative completion semantics negation failure also interpreted epistemically
In interpretation B mean literally B known believed
The epistemic interpretation advantage combined simply classical negation extended logic programming formalise phrase contrary shown contrary classical negation shown epistemic interpretation negation failure
The fact Horn clause given procedural interpretation vice versa procedure understood Horn clause backward reasoning mean logic program combine declarative procedural representation
The inclusion mean logic programming kind
Despite simplicity compared classical logic combination Horn clause negation failure proved surprisingly expressive
For example provides natural representation law cause effect formalised
It also shown correspond quite naturally language legislation
In particular Prakken Sartor credit representation British Nationality Act logic program hugely influential development computational representation legislation showing logic programming enables intuitively appealing representation directly deployed generate automatic inference
The programming language developed
It emerged collaboration Colmerauer Edinburgh
Colmerauer working using logic represent semantics using resolution
During summer Colmerauer Kowalski discovered clausal form logic could used represent resolution theorem provers could used parsing
They observed theorem provers like behave parser others like behave parser
It following summer Kowalski working Colmerauer developed procedural interpretation implication
This dual interpretation later became formalised Prolog notation read used declaratively procedurally
It also became clear clause could restricted definite clause atomic predicate logic formula could restricted generalised LUSH
Kowalski procedural interpretation LUSH described memo published
Colmerauer Philippe Roussel used dual interpretation clause basis Prolog implemented summer autumn
The first Prolog program also written implemented Marseille French system
The use Prolog practical programming language given great momentum development compiler David Warren Edinburgh
Experiments demonstrated Edinburgh Prolog could compete processing speed symbolic programming language
Edinburgh Prolog became standard strongly influenced definition standard Prolog
extension normal Logic Programming allows predicate declared abducible predicate open undefined
A clause abductive logic program form atomic formula abducible literal whose predicate abducible atomic formula whose predicate abducible
The abducible predicate constrained integrity constraint form arbitrary literal defined abducible atomic negated
For example predicate abducible
Problem solving achieved deriving hypothesis expressed term abducible predicate solution problem solved
These problem either observation need explained classical goal solved normal logic programming
For example hypothesis explains observation
Moreover hypothesis entail solution goal finding something fly Abductive logic programming used fault diagnosis planning natural language processing machine learning
It also used interpret Negation Failure form abductive reasoning
Because mathematical logic long tradition distinguishing metalanguage logic programming also allows
The simplest metalogic program true represents empty conjunction clause A B mean clause form A Metalogic programming allows metalevel representation combined natural language
It also used implement logic specified mean
Metalogic used logic programming implement metaprograms manipulate program database knowledge base axiomatic theory data
combine Horn clause logic programming
It extends Horn clause allowing predicate declared constraint predicate occur literal body clause
A constraint logic program set clause form atomic formula constraint
Declaratively clause read ordinary logical implication However whereas predicate head clause defined constraint logic program predicate constraint predefined structure theory
Procedurally subgoals whose predicate defined program solved ordinary logic programming constraint checked satisfiability implement semantics constraint predicate
An initial problem solved reducing satisfiable conjunction constraint
The following constraint logic program represents toy temporal database history teacher Here constraint predicate usual intended semantics
The following goal clause query database find taught The solution
Constraint logic programming used solve problem field verification finance
It closely related
Concurrent logic programming integrates concept logic programming
Its development given big impetus choice system programming language
A concurrent logic program set guarded form The conjunction called clause commitment operator
Declaratively guarded Horn clause read ordinary logical implication However procedurally several clause whose head match given goal clause executed parallel checking whether guard hold
If guard one clause hold committed choice made one clause execution proceedes subgoals chosen clause
These subgoals also executed parallel
Thus concurrent logic programming implement form care nondeterminism rather know nondeterminism
For example following concurrent logic program defines predicate used shuffle two list combining single list preserve ordering two list Here represents empty list represents list first element followed list Prolog
Notice first occurrence second third clause list constructor whereas second occurrence commitment operator
The program used example shuffle list invoking goal clause The program generate single solution example
Arguably concurrent logic programming based message passing consequently subject indeterminacy concurrent system see
Carl Hewitt argued concurrent logic programming based logic sense computational step logically deduced
However concurrent logic programming result terminating computation logical consequence program partial result partial computation logical consequence program residual goal process network
Consequently indeterminacy computation implies logical consequence program deduced
combine concurrent logic programming using constraint control concurrency
A clause contain guard set constraint may block applicability clause
When guard several clause satisfied concurrent constraint logic programming make committed choice use one
Inductive logic programming concerned generalizing positive negative example context background knowledge logic program
Recent work area combining logic programming learning probability given rise new field
Several researcher extended logic programming feature derived predicate variable
Such language include Prolog extension
Basing logic programming within resulted design logic programming language considerably expressive based classical logic
Horn clause program represent state change change argument predicate
In linear logic programming one use ambient linear logic support state change
Some early design logic programming language based linear logic include LO Andreoli Pareschi Lolli ACL Forum Miller

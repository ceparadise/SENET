Abstraction Java Object oriented programming way segregate implementation interface one five fundamental along Encapsulation Inheritance Polymorphism Class Object
Abstraction Java achieved using interface abstract class Java
An interface abstract class something concrete something incomplete
In order use interface abstract class need extend implement abstract method concrete behavior
One example Abstraction creating interface denote common behavior without specifying detail behavior work
You create interface called Server start stop method
This called abstraction Server every server way start stop detail may differ
As I said earlier Abstraction Java implemented using abstract class interface discussed next section
In fact What abstraction Java Difference Abstraction Encapsulation also popular core Java interview strong OOPS skill one primary requirement Java developer
A Car Engine wheel many part
When write property Car Engine wheel single class would look way public class Car int price String name String color int engineCapacity int engineHorsePower String wheelName int wheelPrice void move forward void rotate method void internalCombustion Method In example attribute wheel engine added Car type
As per programming create kind issue
But come maintenance application becomes complex
Abstraction three advantage By using abstraction separate thing grouped another type
Frequently changing property method grouped separate type main type need go change
This add strength OOAD principle Code open Extension closed Modification
Simplifies representation domain model
Applying abstraction composition example modified given public class Car Engine engine new Engine Wheel wheel new Wheel int price String name String color void move forward public class Engine int engineCapacity int engineHorsePower void internalCombustion Method public class Wheel String wheelName int wheelPrice void rotate method You see attribute method related Engine Wheel moved respective class
Engine Wheel referred Car type
When ever instance Car created Engine Wheel available Car change Types Engine Wheel change confined class affect Car class
Modular programming approach application code subdivided separate subprogram running specific function subroutine
These chunk code split worked multiple programmer team individual time chunk code dedicated specific task
These task also become recyclable tweaked fit program
This keep programmer write similar task future module already exists another location handle task hand
The programmer simply pull existing module tweak insert new program working saving time energy work
If creating program track attendance multiple class school master program would achieve task student class throughout year
If application broken module one module might track attendance specific student course year
Another module might group student attendance record class Geology Science class even sophomore class junior class class
The modularization program allows applied various scenario student year school anywhere attendance need tracked simply tweaking existing code making fit new scenario

technique emphasizes separating functionality independent interchangeable contains everything necessary execute one aspect desired functionality
A module interface express element provided required module
The element defined interface detectable module
The contains working code corresponds element declared interface
Modular programming closely related goal facilitating construction large software program system decomposition smaller piece originating around
While historically usage term inconsistent today modular programming refers decomposition code entire program piece structured programming code use structured programming use kind
In programming use interface architectural pattern construct module known
The term like sometimes used instead
In implementation distinct concept package collection module upcoming introduction collection package enhanced access control planned
Furthermore term package us software example
A similar concept typically refers higher level component piece whole module piece individual program
The scale term module varies significantly language Python file module planned module collection package turn collection file
Other term module include used dialect
Languages formally support module concept include CL Morpho several derivative
Conspicuous example language lack support module Pascal original form
As module proposed module added Pascal superseded Modula Oberon included module start various derivative included module
native module since
Modular programming performed even programming language lack explicit syntactic feature support named module
For example also us module programming ILE
With modular programming module perform logically discrete function interacting interface
Often module form DAG case cyclic dependency module seen indicating single module
In case module form DAG arranged hierarchy module independent depending module module depend one
A particular program library module hierarchy turn seen module program library system
When creating modular system instead creating monolithic application smallest component whole several smaller module written separately composed together construct executable application program
Typically also separately via linked
A may perform construction
This make modular designed system built correctly far reusable traditional monolithic design since many module may reused without change project
This also facilitates breaking project several smaller project
Theoretically modularized software project easily assembled large team since team member creating whole system even need know system whole
They focus assigned smaller task claimed counter key assumption actually possible add developer late software making later still
Modular programming form subsystem particularly software library date early software system used
Modular programming per se goal modularity developed late analog concept
The term modular programming date least National Symposium Modular Programming organized Information Systems Institute July key concept SoC
Modules included original specification included extension early implementation later formalized
One first language designed start modular programming
Another early modular language Wirth drew Mesa well original Modula successor influenced later language particularly successor
Modula use like refer object module coincides notation access field record similarly attribute method object widespread seen C Dart Go Java Python among others
Modular programming became widespread original language include module later version notably included form unit
The Extended Pascal ISO standard kept closer modular support
one complete module system including parameterized module map module
In modular programming overshadowed often conflated particularly due popularity Java
For example C family language support object class originally supporting module year later
Java support module form package though primary unit code organization class
However Python prominently used module object start using module primary unit code organization package unit includes support module object vast array module available
Modular programming widespread found virtually major language developed since
The relative importance module varies language language still overlap confusion class unit organization encapsulation distinct concept

Modular programming process subdividing computer program separate
A module separate software component
It often used variety application function component system
Similar function grouped unit programming code separate function developed separate unit code code reused application
programming OOP compatible modular programming concept large extent
Modular programming enables multiple programmer divide work debug piece program independently
Modules modular programming enforce logical boundary component improve maintainability
They incorporated interface
They designed way minimize dependency different module
Teams develop module separately require knowledge module system
Each every modular application version number associated
This provides developer flexibility module maintenance
If change applied module affected subroutine changed
This make program easier read understand
Modular programming main module many auxiliary module
The main module compiled executable EXE call auxiliary module function
Auxiliary module exist separate executable file load main EXE run
Each module unique name assigned PROGRAM statement
Function name across module unique easy access function used main module must exported
Languages support module concept IBM Assembler COBOL RPG FORTRAN Morpho Zonnon Erlang among others

In language syntactic extension capability module program written separate language module system must ensure module interoperate correctly
In Racket module system ensures separating module code phase runtime allowing phased import export inside module
We present algorithm called demodularization combine executable code phased modular program single module optimized whole program
The demodularized program behavior modular counterpart easier optimize
We show program maintain meaning operational semantics demodularization process verify performance increase comparing modular Racket program equivalent modularized optimized program
We use existing Racket optimizer optimize demodularized program decompiling intermediate form optimizer us
We also demonstrate dead code elimination optimization dramatically reduces file size demodularized Racket program

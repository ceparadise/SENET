In programming unchangeable object whose state modified created
This contrast changeable object modified created
In case object considered immutable even internally used attribute change object state appears unchanging external point view
For example object us cache result expensive computation could still considered immutable object
Strings concrete object typically expressed immutable object improve readability runtime efficiency
Immutable object also useful inherently
Other benefit simpler understand reason offer higher security mutable object
In value held whose content never change known differentiate variable could altered execution
Examples include conversion factor meter foot value several decimal place
field may calculated program run unlike constant known beforehand never change initialized
Sometimes one talk certain object immutable
This mean way change part object state even though part object may changeable
If field immutable object immutable
If whole object extended another class object called
This might example help explicitly enforce certain invariant certain data object staying lifetime object
In language done keyword
designates field immutable
In language reversed field object record default immutable need explicitly marked
In object referred using
Some example language many
In case matter whether state object vary object shared via reference
If object known immutable copied simply making copy instead copying entire object
Because reference typically size usually much smaller object result memory saving potential boost execution speed
The reference copying technique much difficult use mutable object user reference mutable object change user reference see change
If intended effect difficult notify user respond correctly
In situation entire object rather reference usually easy costly solution
The alternative technique handling change mutable object
A technique blend advantage object supported directly almost modern hardware COW
Using technique user asks system copy object instead merely create new reference still point object
As soon user attempt modify object particular reference system make real copy applies modification set reference refer new copy
The user unaffected still refer original object
Therefore COW user appear mutable version object although case user modify object speed advantage immutable object preserved
popular system allows save memory space still correctly handling anything application program might
The practice always using reference place copy equal object known
If interning used two object considered equal reference typically represented integer equal
Some language automatically example automatically
If algorithm implement interning guaranteed every case possible comparing object equality reduced comparing pointer substantial gain speed application
Even algorithm guaranteed comprehensive still exists possibility case improvement object equal use reference
Interning generally useful immutable object
Immutable object useful application
Multiple thread act data represented immutable object without concern data changed thread
Immutable object therefore considered mutable object
Immutability imply object stored computer unwriteable
Rather immutability construct indicates programmer normal interface object necessarily absolutely instance circumventing type system violating
In string immutable object
Both Java Framework mutable version string
In Java mutable version Java mutable version
mutable string byte variant named
Additionally Java immutable
Similar pattern
In pure language possible create mutable object without extending language
via mutable reference library object immutable
In object declared either
mutable typically implicit default
immutable via keyword
Subprogram parameter immutable mode mutable mode
In enforce immutability field class statement
By enforcing field immutable obtain immutable type
In implementation would allow user declare new instance class either immutable mutable desired providing two different version method
Notice necessary fact impossible provide specialized constructor instance
Note field pointer reference another object might still possible mutate object pointed pointer reference within const method without violating
It argued case object really immutable
also provides abstract opposed bitwise immutability via keyword allows member variable changed within method
A classic example immutable object instance Java class The method change data ABC contains
Instead new String object instantiated given data abc construction
A reference String object returned method
To make String contain data abc different approach needed
Now String reference new String object contains abc
There nothing syntax class String enforces immutable rather none String class method ever affect data String object contains thus making immutable
The keyword used implementing immutable primitive type object reference make immutable
See example Primitive type variable etc
reassigned defined
This prevented using
Reference type made immutable using keyword
prevents reassignment
Primitive wrapper also immutable
Immutable class implemented following simple guideline
In one create immutable class Moo library simply declaring attribute read Creating immutable class used require two step first creating accessors either automatically manually prevent modification object attribute secondly preventing direct modification instance data instance class usually stored hash reference could locked Hash function Or manually written accessor In type number booleans string tuples frozensets immutable custom class generally mutable
To simulate immutability class one override attribute setting deletion raise exception The standard library helper creates simple immutable class roughly equivalent plus feature
In type number string immutable custom object generally mutable
To simulate immutability object one may define property writable false
However approach still allow new property added
Alternatively one may use make existing object immutable
The use immutable state become rising trend JavaScript since introduction favour state management pattern
substantially diverges implementation making core pair type con cell immutable
Instead provides parallel mutable pair type via etc
In addition many immutable type supported example immutable string vector used extensively
New structs immutable default unless field specifically declared mutable whole struct The language also support immutable hash table implemented functionally immutable dictionary
In entity narrowly binding defined mutable immutable declaration one use value immutable entity variable mutable one
Note even though immutable binding reassigned may still refer mutable object still possible call mutating method object immutable underlying may mutable
For example following code snippet defines immutable entity integer type inferred mutable entity named
By default collection class immutable return new instance rather mutating existing one
While may sound inefficient implementation class guarantee immutability mean new instance existing node especially case creating copy efficient

The standard class mutable
It depends strongly language
Some even allow mutable object
Many mainstream language default highly mutable depending member expose class public interface
In least couple mainstream language particularly dynamic language really hard make immutable object
See definition information In functional programming immutable object object whose state modified created
This contrast A mutable class one change internal state created
Generally speaking class mutable unless special effort made make immutable
A mutable class class changeable state
example class representing number mutable something like change internal state
In functional programming object whose state modified created
This contrast modified created
An object either entirely immutable attribute object may declared immutable example using const member data attribute programming language
Usually usual language mutable
Classes typically mutable though language deviate
The object create class hand often mutable include state take special care prevent anyone changing state object creation

What difference mutable immutable string C
Mutable immutable English word meaning change change respectively
The meaning word IT context
The meaning word C programming language environment though obviously name type may differ may detail
For record To effect change string represented C actually create new object
The original changed unchangeable
In case better use easier reason
need consider possibility thread might change string
However need construct modify string using sequence operation may efficient use
immutable
string altered
When alter string adding example actually creating new string
But immutable rather mutable alter string many time multiple concatenation use
An object mutable created state changed calling various operation otherwise immutable
In C string represented class
The keyword alias class
The
So operation perform string like Substring Remove Replace concatenation using operator etc create new string return
See following program demonstration This print respectively
For string immutable check
If want string want modify often use class

For advice refer
All object immutable C
Objects class created never represent value one constructed
All operation seem change string instead produce new one
This inefficient memory extremely useful regard able trust string wo change form long change reference string referred never change
A mutable object contrast data field altered
One method change content object Property written change value object
If mutable similar one String make copy want absolutely sure wo change
This mutable object dangerous use key form object could change data structure would way knowing leading corrupt data would eventually crash program
However change much much memory efficient making complete copy wanted change single character something similar
Generally right thing use mutable object creating something immutable object done
This applies object immutable form course collection
It often useful provide form collection though equivalent immutable sending internal state collection otherwise something could take return value something corrupt data
Immutable When operation object creates new object hence state modifiable case string
Mutable When perform operation object object modified new obect created case StringBuilder In aka string immutable object
That mean create object change value afterwards
You recreate immutable object
mutable equivalent chane value For Example Generates following MSIL If investigate code
You see whenever chane object actually creating new one
But whenever change value text dont recreate object
Strings mutable use string pool behind scene
It mean Both name referring memory location string pool
Now suppose want change It look string pool string My Loving Country found get reference wise new string My Loving Country created string pool get reference
But whole process changed variable like still using
And reason string
work different manner use string pool
When create instance StringBuilder It allocate memory chunk size byte instance operation modify memory location memory shared object
And reason
None actually
The String class mutable
This kind logic done time String StringBuilder class actually
They allocate new string time call Concat Substring etc
use pointer arithmetic copy new string
Strings mutate hence considered immutable
By way attempt string literal badly mess program This string literal interned desktop Framework word point exact string mutating one mutate
This fine dandy though using unmanaged platform like WinRT lack string interning
To clarify thing mutable string C general
Other langues support mutable string string change framework
So correct answer question ALL string immutable C
string specific meaning
string lowercase keyword merely shortcut object instantiated class
All object created string class ALWAYS immutable
If want mutable representation text need use another class like StringBuilder
StringBuilder allows iteratively build collection convert string immutable
implementation detail
muttable
calling private method imuttable
StringBuilder Char array chunking
The data value may changed
Note The variable value may changed original immutable data value discarded new data value created memory
Strings immutable mean allocating new memory everytime instead working existing string
Strings created pool
If string already exists simply create
StringBuilder mutable type mean using memory location keep stuff one instance
It create instance hence decrease performance application
From Short Answer String immutable whereas StringBuilder mutable
What mean
Wiki say In immutable object object whose state modified created
This contrast mutable object modified created
From StringBuilder Class documentation The String object immutable
Every time use one method class create new string object memory requires new allocation space new object
In situation need perform repeated modification string overhead associated creating new String object costly
The class used want modify string without creating new object
For example using StringBuilder class boost performance concatenating many string together loop
Here example Immutable string Mutable string builder String C immutable
If concatenate string actually making new string new string object
But StringBuilder creates mutable string

This newbie question I could find enough answer Google
What people mean say programming general OO programming specifically
Also mutable immutable state generally programming also specifically OOP
You state associate value number string complex data structure identity point time
For example number represent state number always natural number
As another example string HELLO sequence five character completely described character contains sequence appear
In five million year string HELLO still string HELLO pure value
In order state consider world pure value associated kind entity posse
Identity primitive idea mean distinguish two thing regardless property may
For example two car model colour two different car
Given thing identity attach property described pure value
car property blue
You describe fact associating pair car
The pair colour blue pure value describing particular car
State associated particular entity also particular point time
So say today car state Tomorrow I repainted black new state Note state entity change identity definition
Well long entity exists course car may created destroyed keep identity throughout lifetime
It make sense speak identity something exist yet
If value property attached given entity change time say state entity
Otherwise say state
The common implementation store state entity kind variable global variable object member variable
store state
Mutable state implemented using assignment assignment operation replaces previous snapshot new one
This solution normally us memory location store current snapshot
Overwriting memory location destructive operation replaces snapshot new one
find interesting talk approach
An alternative view subsequent state history entity stream possibly infinite sequence value see

In case snapshot stored different memory location program examine different snapshot time
Unused snapshot longer needed
State simply information something held memory
As simple exercise object orientation think class cookie cutter cooky object
You create cookie instantiate object using cookie cutter class
Let say one property cookie color changed using food coloring
The color cookie part state property
Mutable state state changed make object cookie
Immutable state state changed
Immutable object state changed become important dealing ability one processor computer operate object time
Immutability guarantee rely state stable valid object lifetime
In general state object held private member variable accessed property method
I think term state opposed concrete type state member variable useful comparing stateful API stateless one
Trying define state without mentioning APIs bit like trying define variable function without mentioning programming language correct answer make sense people already know word mean
For example OpenGL probably stateful API I know
If I may ludicrously oversimplify moment might say look something like Almost every function used pas state OpenGL need remember end call one anticlimactically simple function drawing
A stateless version oversimplified OpenGL would probably look like You often hear people say APIs le state easier reason
If keep argument count control I generally agree
As far I know distinction meaningful specify
For example using constructor It would hard implement window class remember size decide whether user able change window size creating
In OOP true state mean member variable lot
For instance method static variable lambda become closure capturing variable
In case variable persist across multiple call function thus probably qualify state
Local variable regular function may also considered state depending used one I main often count
The state
A condition mode regard circumstance
The state something set value attribute given moment
In OOP state object snapshot attribute value given moment
The state color blue price size small
If later You change one attribute also changed state whole since object longer
Sometimes class designed property value changed created
All value property either passed constructor read source like database file way change value moment since setter method way changing value inside object
That called state changed mutated
All destroy object create new one assing reference variable

String immutable class Java
An immutable class simply class whose instance modified
Why Java programming language choose make object class String immutable
This issue strongly connected notion mean instance class
In strict term class associated invariant predicate always hold true exit public method class
Such notion central ensuring inheritance example part
One pernicious issue Java difficult prevent client code breaking class invariant
For example consider following class If String immutable would possible user ZipCode call change character subsequent time thereby breaking invariant destroying conceptual integrity offered encapsulation ZipCode concept
Since kind integrity essential ensuring large system valid answer question really begs wider one Things like string date naturally value
In term expect copy constructor assignment operator equality operator never expect take address
Hence expect individually allocated heap
Virtual method make sense
Domain object naturally reference
one copy constructor assignment operator equality operator equal identical
We take address expect heap allocated
Methods generally virtual
Java value class reference one
Values faked immutable object
This true string unfortunately date
The mutability Java date caused frequent problem deprecated
Mutable value ca used basis hash example
Java designed allow execution subsection program code security constrained environment
The way requirement implemented setting SecurityManager thread given access parameter certain critical operation eg opening file asked whether operation allowed go ahead
If Java Strings mutable program could circumvent restriction creating two thread one performed open file operation would allowed modified string stored filename one would allowed
There possibility security manager would read original string accept operation would passed file opening code would precede open second permitted file
There two possible way preventing scenario The latter possibility would make operation run slowly would likely implementation contain bug using immutable string sensible decision
More generally immutable object useful allow sharing without needing make defensive copy may necessary even code prevent bug source data change even without requirement decision would still reasonable one

Thank opportunity help question
Immutable class Java class whose object modified created
Any modification Immutable object result new object
For example String immutable Java
Mostly Immutable also final Java order prevent sub class overriding method Java compromise Immutability
You achieve functionality making member non final private modifying except constructor
Secure Information Content erased question completed

auto register static extern storage class specifier typedef also considered storage class specifier also support storage class specifier
In addition add one important storage class specifier whose name mutable
Sometimes requirement modify one data member class struct const function even though want function update member class struct
This task easily performed using mutable keyword
Consider example use mutable useful
Suppose go hotel give order waiter bring food dish
After giving order suddenly decide change order food
Assume hotel provides facility change ordered food take order new food within minute giving order
After minute order cancelled old order replaced new order
See following code detail
Output Closely observe output program
The value data member changed const function declared mutable
The keyword mutable mainly used allow particular data member const object modified

Adding mutable variable allows const pointer change member
mutable particularly useful member constant need updateable
Data member declared mutable modified even though part object declared const
You use mutable specifier name declared static const reference
As predict output following two program

A object changed created object ca
In Java everything except string mutable default There way make existing object immutable
Even object declared field still changed That said defining class make object immutable making field
Strings mutable immutable depending language
Strings immutable Java
When modify string actually creating separate copy leaving first intact But language like string mutable If want mutable string Java use object Or convert string character mutable
Mutable object nice make change without allocating new object

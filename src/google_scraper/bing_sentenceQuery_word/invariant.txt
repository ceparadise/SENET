The word seems get used number context
The best I figure mean variable ca change
Is darn Java

An invariant conceptual variable
In general property program state always true
A function method ensures invariant hold said maintain invariant
For instance binary search tree might invariant every node key node left child le node key
A correctly written insertion function tree maintain invariant
As tell sort thing store variable statement program
By figuring sort invariant program maintain reviewing code make sure actually maintains invariant avoid logical error code
It condition know always true particular place logic check debugging work gone wrong
I usually view term algorithm structure
For example could loop invariant could asserted always true beginning end iteration
That loop supposed process collection object one stack another could say top bottom loop
If invariant check failed would indicate something went wrong
In example could mean forgot push processed element onto final stack etc
The magic wikipedia In computer science predicate true remain true throughout specific sequence operation called invariant sequence
Something change within block code Following invariant quite useful writing clean code since knowing conceptually invariant present code allows easily decide organize code reach aim
As mentioned ealier also useful debugging checking see invariant maintained often good way seeing whatever manipulation attempting perform actually want
The ADT invariant specifes relationship among data field instance variable must always true execution instance method
As line state In computer science predicate true remain true throughout specific sequence operation called invariant sequence
To better understand hope example help
Consider scenario get value get total count variable called add variable called The code would something like Reads input put After one successful read increment Repeat read stop The invariant must True
So initially start code This loop read data standard input store x
Well good
But becomes false first part followed kept true
Simple
increment count
So would good
Now code becomes something like Even concept must TRUE False satisfy second part invariant
So
Add store next time read new value x
Now code becomes something like code Ah
Now loop invariant True code work fine

I reading lot talk invariant
As far I understood invariant condition hold expression
They among thing useful proving loop correct I remember Logic course correctly
Is description correct I missed something
Have ever used program
And benefit
In OOP invariant set assertion must always hold true life object program valid
It hold true end constructor start destructor whenever object currently executing method change state
An example invariant could exactly one two member variable null
Or one given value set allowed value
I sometime use member function object check invariant hold
If case assert raised
And method called start exit method change object one line An invariant common sense mean condition must true point time even always program executing

PreConditions PostConditions used assert condition must true function called return
Object invariant used assert object must valid state throughout time exists
This design contract principle
I used invariant informally using check code
But recently I playing code directly support invariant
Based following quote Coders At Work
But know invariant maintaining see ah maintain invariant get log lookup time
I guess invariant condition want maintain ensure desired effect
It seems invariant two sens differ subtle way So like assertion like tool proving correctness performance property I think
See example proving correctness solution MU puzzle
Actually sense invariant
What program module function supposed word purpose
From Coders At Work interview But make big software manageable global invariant statement supposed thing supposed true
An invariant like rule assumption used dictate logic program
For example suppose software application keep track user account
Suppose also user multiple account whatever reason need differentiate user main account alias account
This could DB record something else let assume user account represented class object
class userAccount private char pUserName private char pParentAccountUserName An invariant might assumption pParentAccountUserName NULL empty object parent account
You use invariant distinguish different type account
There probably better method distinguish different type user account keep mind example show invariant might used
Coming physic background physic invariant essentially quantity vary throughout entire
For instance physic closed system total energy conserved
Or physic two particle collide resulting fragment must contain exactly energy started exactly momentum vector quantity
Usually enough invariant totally specify result
For instance collision four invariant three momentum component energy component system six degree freedom six number describe state
The invariant ought conserved within rounding error conservation prove solution correct
So typically thing important sanity check ca prove correctness

I understand literal sense
I also recognize I type code
But I think I understand importance term context computer science
Whenever I read paper language design famous scientist term keep popping jargon part I understand
What special
An algorithm repeatable process
If repeatable attribute change repetition
These invariant
The invariant combined operate potentially varying data fed algorithm
Thus whole point programming identify vary essentially program
In program notion object single thing well
This essentially mean OOP class defines invariant single algorithm along variable variant data object might need
Ideally OO would isolate varies much possible object mostly invariant
The notion invariant strongly linked effect
I believe promoted Bertrand Meyer Contract DbC approach software design
DbC enriches Abstract Data Types backbone class important notion
It easily explained referring procedure I try explain reference A represents condition input data procedure must respect order call procedure
This precondition must respected enforced client particular procedure
The procedure designer might however defend client respect precondition asserting condition first line procedure
For example method precondition might
A represents condition output data procedure return entirely job procedure designer respect postcondition provided precondition respected defense programming style returning postcondition asserted
An regarded precondition postcondition different understanding precondition postcondition concept
An invariant basically say input particular condition met procedure called particular condition valid procedure called
For example valid invariant procedure might say state call call
Enforcing invariant procedure procedure great thing since reduces useful since side effect great evil programming
A particular procedure might change state input argument change state global variable depend global variable might lead nasty situation two identical call procedure input might yield different output
This lead knowing history call hard debug especially multithreading context
An invariant logical property preserved operation
You need invariant reason loop
Since know beforehand many iteration would need loop iteration must preserve invariant end prove useful property loop
You need invariant reason property encapsulated data
Often various data inside module object need satisfy certain property correct operation example list representing set must always sorted
You want function method operating data preserve property invariant
From know importance invariant come fact building block proving algorithm compute certain function
For example developed new sorting algorithm sure really sort every input every correct output
The next step construct invariant correspond flow algorithm prove sort using invariant
In context programming language type system invariant type type
For example java overloading method parameter invariant return type covariant may subtype

I problem trying understand concept loop invariant
I following code M N predefined constant
I figured code actually division algorithm end print quotient remainder
But unclear invariant
Can I say invariant since always true every iteration
How could I prove mathematical perspective
A loop invariant expression true iteration
But also lead true loop terminates
Although true It help achieving
Intuitively You would want invariant division guarantee get termination condition true
The formal proof follow idea

CLRS prof correction algorithm using loop invariant At start iteration loop line subarray A j consists element originally A j sorted order
We use loop invariant help u understand algorithm correct
We must show three thing loop invariant Initialization It true prior first iteration loop
Maintenance If true iteration loop remains true Termination When loop terminates invariant give u useful property help show algorithm correct
In explanation maintenance aspect loop invariant following mentioned Maintenance A formal treatment property would require u state show loop invariant loop line
At point however prefer get bogged formalism rely informal analysis show second property hold outer loop
Why would formal treatment require loop invariant loop
Having one invariant outer loop sufficient prove correctness would formal treatment require loop invariant
The invariant outer loop sufficient first need prove actually invariant
For need provide prove precondition postcondition every statement inside loop
And prove precondition postcondition inner loop need another invariant
To human fairly obvious inner loop correctly find place insert next element thus use informal argument
But formal semantics like boil proof mechanical symbolic manipulation checked machine thus ca
Whenever encounter statement must rule dictate loop mean provide loop invariant

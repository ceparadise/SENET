Typical formal definition software engineering include When first digital appeared early instruction make operate wired machine
Practitioners quickly realized design flexible came stored program architecture
Thus division hardware software began used deal complexity computing
started appear early also another major step abstraction
Major language released late deal scientific algorithmic business problem respectively
wrote seminal paper Go To Statement Considered Harmful introduced key concept help programmer deal complexity
The origin term software engineering attributed different source
The term software engineering used August issue Communications ACM Volume number letter ACM membership ACM President Anthony Oettinger
More commonly traced title seminal NATO conference Professor
Bauer first conference software engineering
The conference attended international expert software agreed defining best practice software grounded application engineering
The result conference report defines software developed
The original report publicly available
The field also give credit many work development spread
The discipline software engineering created address poor quality software get project exceeding time budget control ensure software built systematically rigorously measurably time budget within specification
Engineering already address issue hence principle used engineering applied software
The widespread lack best practice software time perceived
documented several key advance field book Engineering Economics
These include Constructive Cost Model relates software development effort program T SLOC
The book analyzes software project concludes cost fixing error escalates project move toward field use
The book also asserts key driver software cost capability software development team
In SEI established federally funded research development center headquartered campus Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh Pennsylvania United States
founded SEI Software Process Program aimed understanding managing software engineering process
His book Managing Software Process asserts Software Development Process controlled measured improved
The Process Maturity Levels introduced would become Capability Maturity Model Integration Development defined US Government evaluates ability software development team
Modern generally accepted software engineering collected subcommittee published SWEBOK
Software engineering divided
Some Knowledge prerequisite becoming software engineer
In produced published Technical Report describing body knowledge recommend mastered graduate software engineer four year experience
Many software engineer enter profession obtaining university degree training vocational school
One standard international curriculum undergraduate software engineering degree defined updated
A number university Software Engineering degree program Campus program Online program program program program United States

Injuries occupation rare
However like worker spend long period front computer terminal typing keyboard engineer programmer susceptible eyestrain back discomfort hand wrist problem
The field future look bright according rated Software Engineer best job United States
In software engineering ranked best job United States time
The offer certification specific topic like process improvement
company also sponsor certification examination
Many program oriented toward specific technology managed vendor technology
These certification program tailored institution would employ people use technology
Broader certification general software engineering skill available various professional society
As certified software professional CSDP
In added certification known Certified Software Development Associate CSDA
The professional certification program early discontinued due lack interest
The ACM examined possibility professional certification software engineer late eventually decided certification inappropriate professional industrial practice software engineering
In developed legally recognized professional certification called available fully qualified member
Software engineer may eligible membership qualify Chartered Engineer status
In Canada developed legally recognized professional certification called
In Ontario Canada Software Engineers graduate accredited program successfully complete PEO Professional Practice Examination PPE least month acceptable engineering experience eligible licensed become Professional Engineers
The PEO recognize online distance education however consider Computer Science program equivalent software engineering program despite tremendous overlap two
This sparked controversy certification war
It also held number holder profession exceptionally low
The vast majority working professional field hold degree CS SE
Given difficult certification path holder degree never bother pursue license
The initial impact outsourcing relatively lower cost international human resource developing third world country led massive migration software development activity corporation North America Europe India later China Russia developing country
This approach flaw mainly distance timezone difference prevented human interaction client developer massive job transfer
This negative impact many aspect software engineering profession
For example student avoid education related software engineering fear importing software product service country displaced
Although statistic currently show threat software engineering related career appear affected
Nevertheless ability smartly leverage offshore resource via workflow improved overall operational capability many organization
When North Americans leaving work Asians arriving work
When Asians leaving work Europeans arriving work
This provides continuous ability human oversight process hour per day without paying overtime compensation disrupting key human resource sleep pattern
While global outsourcing several advantage global generally distributed development run serious difficulty resulting distance developer
This due key element type distance identified geographical temporal cultural communication includes use different language dialect English different location
Research carried area global software development last year extensive body relevant work published highlight benefit problem associated complex activity
As aspect software engineering research ongoing related area
Software engineering direct overlap
It also considered part overall
In general software engineering focus technique application software development industry computer science focus algorithm theory
Typical formal definition The term used le formally Software engineering see practitioner individual follow engineering approach
These approach specified various software engineering book research paper always connotation predictability precision mitigated risk professionalism
This perspective led call licensing certification codified body knowledge mechanism spreading engineering knowledge maturing field

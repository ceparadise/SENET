In context hardware act disproving intended underlying system respect certain property using
Formal verification helpful proving correctness system internal memory software expressed source code
The verification system done providing abstract system correspondence mathematical model nature system otherwise known construction
Examples mathematical object often used model system formal semantics programming language
One approach formation consists systematically exhaustive exploration mathematical model possible also infinite model infinite set state effectively represented finitely using abstraction taking advantage symmetry
Usually consists exploring state transition model using smart abstraction technique consider whole group state single operation reduce computing time
Implementation technique include symbolic state space enumeration
The property verified often described LTL PSL Assertions SVA CTL
The great advantage model checking often fully automatic primary disadvantage general scale large system symbolic model typically limited hundred bit state explicit state enumeration requires state space explored relatively small
Another approach deductive verification
It consists generating system specification possibly annotation collection mathematical truth imply conformance system specification discharging obligation using either interactive theorem provers automatic theorem provers SMT solver
This approach disadvantage typically requires user understand detail system work correctly convey information verification system either form sequence theorem proved form specification system component
function procedure perhaps subcomponents loop data structure
Formal verification software program involves proving program satisfies formal specification behavior
Subareas formal verification include deductive verification see
A promising verification approach type function include least part function specification code establishes correctness specification
Fully featured dependently typed language support deductive verification special case
Another complementary approach efficient code produced specification series step
An example approach approach seen another form
These technique meaning verified property logically deduced semantics meaning guarantee
A sound technique yield result searched entire space possibility
An example unsound technique one search subset possibility instance integer certain number give result
Techniques also meaning algorithmic implementation guaranteed terminate answer undecidable meaning may never terminate
Because bounded unsound technique often likely decidable sound one
one aspect testing product fitness purpose
Validation complementary aspect
Often one refers overall checking process
The verification process consists aspect
software product one inspect source code static run specific test case dynamic
Validation usually done dynamically product tested putting typical atypical usage Does satisfactorily meet

Page Validation verification two way check data entered computer correct
entered incorrectly little use
automatic computer check ensure data entered sensible reasonable
It check accuracy data
For example secondary school student likely aged
The computer programmed accept number
This check
However guarantee number typed correct
For example student age might entered valid incorrect
There number validation type used check data entered

In process checking software system meet specification fulfills intended purpose
It may also referred
It normally responsibility part
In simple term software verification Assuming build X software achieve goal without bug gap
On hand software validation Was X built
Does X meet high level requirement
Verification validation thing although often confused
succinctly expressed difference Building right product implies creating Requirements Specification contains need goal stakeholder software product
If artifact incomplete wrong developer able build product stakeholder want
This form artifact specification validation
Building product right implies use Requirements Specification input next phase development process design process output Design Specification
Then also implies use Design Specification feed construction process
Every time output process correctly implement input specification software product one step closer final verification
If output process incorrect developer building product stakeholder want correctly
This kind verification called artifact specification verification
Software validation check software product satisfies fit intended use checking software meet user requirement specification artifact need operate software need stakeholder user operator administrator manager investor etc
There two way perform software validation internal external
During internal software validation assumed goal stakeholder correctly understood expressed requirement artifact precise comprehensively
If software meet requirement specification internally validated
External validation happens performed asking stakeholder software meet need
Different software development methodology call different level user stakeholder involvement feedback external validation discrete continuous event
Successful final external validation occurs stakeholder accept software product express satisfies need
Such final external validation requires use
However also possible perform internal static test find meet requirement specification fall scope static verification software running
Not software product whole validated
Requirements validated software product whole ready waterfall development process requires perfectly defined design start iterative development process require allow continual improvement
Examples artifact validation It would imply verify specification met running software possible anyone know
correctly implemented running software
Only reviewing associated artifact someone conclude specification met
The output software development process stage also subject verification checked input specification see definition CMMI
Examples artifact verification According Validation software development process seen form User Requirements Specification validation end development process equivalent Internal External Software validation
Verification CMMI point view evidently artifact kind
In word software verification ensures output phase software development process effectively carry corresponding input artifact specifies requirement design software product software validation ensures software product meet need stakeholder therefore requirement specification correctly accurately expressed first place
Software verification ensures built right confirms product provided fulfills plan developer
Software validation ensures built right thing confirms product provided fulfills intended use goal stakeholder
This article used strict definition verification
From testing perspective Both verification validation related concept
By verification validation guarantee software quality planning configuration management aspect software engineering required
Within M S community definition verification validation accreditation similar The definition M S validation focus accuracy M S represents intended use
Determining degree M S accuracy required M S approximation reality usually critical determine degree approximation acceptable intended use
This stand contrast software validation
In software system flawless performance absolutely necessary may used ensure correct operation system
However often software system formal method prove costly alternative method software V V must sought
In case often used
A test case tool used process
Test case may prepared software verification software validation determine product built according requirement user
Other method review may used early life cycle provide software validation
ISVV stand
ISVV targeted system aim increase quality software product thereby reducing risk cost operational life software
ISVV provides assurance software performs specified level confidence within designed parameter defined requirement
ISVV activity performed independent engineering team involved software development process ass process resulting product
The ISVV team independency performed three different level financial managerial technical
ISVV go far beyond traditional verification validation technique applied development team
While latter aim ensure software performs well nominal requirement ISVV focused requirement robustness reliability condition lead software fail
ISVV result finding fed back development team correction improvement
ISVV derives application IV V Independent Verification Validation software
Early ISVV application known today date back early sponsored first significant program related IV V Safeguard System
By end IV V rapidly becoming popular
The constant increase complexity size importance software lead increasing demand IV V applied software ISVV
Meanwhile IV V ISVV software system get consolidated widely used organisation DoD FAA NASA ESA
IV V mentioned formalised IEEE
Initially European consortium led composed DNV N Critical Software SA P Terma DK CODA Scisys UK created first version guide devoted ISVV called ESA Guide Independent Verification Validation support organization
SoftWcare SL E etc
In European Space Agency released second version SoftWcare SL supporting editor received input many different European Space ISVV stakeholder
This guide cover methodology applicable software engineering phase concern ISVV
ISVV usually composed five principal phase phase executed sequentially result tailoring process
Verification validation must meet compliance requirement law regulated industry often guided government agency industrial administrative authority
For instance requires software version validated

Validation verification two way check data entered computer correct
Data entered incorrectly little use

Applying system thinking computing climate sustainability Sometime I drafted frequently asked question list
Here I wrote meaning term validation verification The term Verification Validation commonly used software engineering mean two different type analysis
The usual definition In word validation concerned checking system meet customer actual need verification concerned whether system
Verification help determine whether software high quality ensure system useful
The distinction two term largely role specification
Validation process checking whether specification capture customer need verification process checking software meet specification
Verification includes activity associated producing high quality software testing inspection design analysis specification analysis
It relatively objective process various product document expressed precisely enough subjective judgement needed order verify software
In contrast validation extremely subjective process
It involves making subjective assessment well proposed system address need
Validation includes activity requirement modelling prototyping user evaluation
In traditional phased software lifecycle verification often taken mean checking product phase satisfy requirement previous phase
Validation relegated begining ending project requirement analysis acceptance testing
This view common many software engineering textbook misguided
It assumes customer requirement captured completely start project requirement change software developed
In practice requirement change throughout project partly reaction project development new software make new thing possible
Therefore validation verification needed throughout lifecycle
Finally V V regarded coherent discipline Software V V system engineering discipline evaluates software system context relative system element hardware user software
Software Verification Validation Its Role Computer Assurance Its Relationship Software Project Management Standards Dolores Wallace Roger Fujii NIST Special Publication Having thus carefully distinguished two term advice V V practitioner forget distinction think instead V V toolbox provides wide range tool asking different kind question software
And master use tool figure use
Here one attempt visualize space tool toolbox A range V V technique
Note modeling model checking refer building analyzing abstracted model software behaviour different kind beast scientific model used computational science For climate model definition focus specification make much sense detailed specification climate model built iterative refinement like agile software development
But matter toolbox approach still work mean tool applied little differently
An appropriate toolbox climate modeling look little different picture tool appropriate control system application software etc missing picture particular simulation software
I draw better picture I finished analyzing data field study practice used climate lab
Many different V V tool climate modelling lab room adding tool toolbox sharpening existing tool subject current research
But question best must proceed detailed analysis current practice effective
There seem plenty wandering space claiming model insufficiently verified validated
And people like pontificate climate modeler ought differently
But anyone pontificate way unable give detailed account V V technique climate modeller currently use blowing smoke
If know toolbox already really make constructive comment missing

Until recently software quality metric many development organization nature
That designed track defect occurrence formal machine testing
These listed briefly historical importance replacing upstream quality measure metric supersede
usually highly correlated future defect rate field testing defect rate usually indicate high software complexity special development problem
Although may counterintuitive experience show higher defect rate testing indicate higher defect rate later use
If appear development manager set damage control scenario may apply correct quality problem testing becomes problem field
us defect removal effectiveness DRE metric
This simply defect removed development phase divided defect latent product time get result percentage
Because number latent defect yet known estimated defect removed phase plus defect found later
This metric best used code integration already well downstream development process unfortunately succeeding phase
This simple metric become widely used tool large application development
However ad hoc downstream nature naturally lead important metric include defect fix maintenance development process
Four new metric introduced measure quality software delivered These metric rocket science
The monthly BMI percent simply time number problem arrival month divided number problem closed month
Fix responsiveness mean time problem arrival close
If given problem turnaround time exceeds required standard response time declared delinquent
The percentage delinquent fix time number get fixed time divided number
Fix quality traditionally measured negatively lack quality
It number defective work properly situation worse caused yet problem
The real quality goal course zero defective fix
Computer system complex engineered system software make complex
A number approach taken calculate least estimate degree complexity
The simplest basis LOC count executable statement computer program
This metric began day assembly language programming still used today program written programming language
Most procedural language FORTRAN COBOL ALGOL typically produce six executable ML statement per language statement
language C Java produce three
Recent study show curvilinear relationship defect rate executable LOC
Defect density defect per KLOC appears decrease program size increase program module become large see Figure
Curiously result suggests may optimum program size leading lowest defect course programming language project size product type computing environment
Experience seems indicate small program defect rate defect per KLOC
Programs larger line code similar defect rate
Programs LOC defect rate near
This almost certainly effect complexity small tight program usually intrinsically complex
Programs larger LOC exhibit complexity size many piece
This situation improve Programming greater latitude least greater convenience choice component size procedural programming
As might expect interface coding although programming defect rate constant program size
The Relationship Between LOC Defect Density In Professor Maurice Halstead distinguished software science computer science describing programming process collecting arranging software token either operand operator
His measure follows He based set derivative measure primitive measure express total token vocabulary overall program length potential minimum volume programmed algorithm actual program volume bit program level complexity metric program difficulty among others
For example minimum volume represented function perform task entire program
mean number mental discrimination decision value estimated Halstead
When metric first announced software development thought Halstead violated Aristotle first law scientific inquiry Do employ rigor subject matter bear
But none could gainsay accuracy prediction quality result
In fact latter established software metric issue importance computer scientist established Professor Halstead founder field inquiry
The major criticism approach accurate metric program length dependent N N known sufficient accuracy program almost done
Halstead formula fall short direct quantitative measure fail predict program size quality sufficiently upstream development process
Also choice constant presumes unknown model human memory cognition unfortunately also constant depend program volume
Thus number fault depends program size later experience supported
The result shown Figure indicate number defect constant program size may rather take optimum value program LOC
Perhaps Halstead elaborate quantification fully represent incredible intuition gained long experience
About time Halstead founded software science McCabe proposed topological measure cyclomatic complexity measure number linearly independent path make computer program
To compute cyclomatic complexity program graphed formula used More simply turn M equal number binary decision program plus
An case statement would counted n
binary decision
The advantage measure additive program component module
Usage recommends single module value M greater
However average every fifth sixth program instruction executed branch M strongly correlate program size LOC
As early quality measure focus program per se even module mask true source architectural module
Later researcher proposed structure metric compensate deficiency quantifying program module interaction
For example metric analogous number input output hardware circuit module attempt fill gap
Similar metric include number subroutine call macro inclusion per module number design change module among others
Kan report extensive experimental testing metric also report module length important predictor defect rate number design change complexity level however computed
Quality metric based either directly indirectly counting line code program module unsatisfactory
These metric merely surrogate indicator number opportunity make error perspective program coded
More recently proposed meaningful cluster measurable code user rather programmer perspective
Function point also surrogate error opportunity
They represent user need anticipated application program rather programmer completion
A large program may million LOC application function point would large application system indeed
A may defined collection executable statement performs task together declaration formal parameter local variable manipulated statement
A typical function point metric developed Albrecht IBM weighted sum five component characterize application These represent average weighting factor may vary program size complexity
number component type application
The function count FC double sum The second step employ scale ass impact general system characteristic term likely effect application The score characteristic summed based following formula find value adjustment factor VAF Finally number function point obtained multiplying number function count value adjustment factor This actually highly simplified version commonly used method documented IFPUG
Although function point extrinsic counting metric method considered robust intrinsic LOC counting method appearance somewhat subjective experimental nature
As used time organization develop large software system function point show amazingly high degree repeatability utility
This probably enforce disciplined learning process software development organization much scientific credibility may posse

Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed

A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

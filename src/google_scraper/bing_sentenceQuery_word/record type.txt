In also called basic
A record collection possibly different data type typically fixed number sequence
The field record may also called particularly
Fields may also called though risk confusion element
A may may considered record vice versa depending convention specific programming language
For example date could stored record containing numeric field field represented string numeric field
A Personnel record might contain
A Circle record might contain instance center might represented record containing coordinate
Records distinguished fact number field typically fixed field name field may different type
A describes value variable
Most modern computer language allow programmer define new record type
The definition includes specifying data type field name label accessed
In field name generally preferred due simplicity proper record type studied language
Since record may contain field addition data express many feature
Records exist storage medium including
Records fundamental component data structure especially
Many computer organized array often grouped larger physical record efficiency
The parameter often viewed field record variable argument passed function viewed record value get assigned variable time call
Also often used implement procedure call entry containing procedure parameter local variable return address internal field
An object language essentially record contains procedure specialized handle record object type elaboration record type
Indeed language record special case object known PODSs contrast object use OO feature
A record viewed computer analog
In vein record type viewed computer language analog two implementation abstract specific language
A record may zero A key field set field record serf identifier
A unique key often called simply
For example employee file might contain employee number name department salary
The employee number unique organization would primary key
Depending storage medium file organization employee number might also stored separate file make lookup faster
The department code may unique may also indexed case would considered
If indexed entire employee file would scanned produce listing employee specific department
The salary field would normally considered usable key
Indexing one factor considered designing file
The concept record traced various type used since remote time
The modern notion record computer science field type size already implicit century mechanical calculator
The original medium used data opposed control used record punch card single record
Compare journal entry punch card
Records well established first half century data processing done using punched card
Typically record data file would recorded one punched card specific column assigned specific field
Generally record smallest unit could read external storage
card reader tape disk
Most implementation early special syntax record concept available extensively used use
Some early computer hardware support delimiting record field special instruction copying record
The concept record field central early file utility
first widespread programming language support record type record definition facility quite sophisticated time
The language allows definition nested record alphanumeric integer fractional field arbitrary size precision well field automatically format value assigned insertion currency sign decimal point digit group separator
Each file associated record variable data read written
COBOL also provides statement assigns corresponding field two record according name
The early language developed numeric computing support record type later version language add
The original lacking record except provided adequate surrogate
The one first language fully integrate record type basic type logically consistent type system
The programming language provided record
The programming language initially provided record concept kind template could laid top memory area rather true record data type
The latter provided eventually declaration two concept still distinct language
Most language designed Pascal also supported record
The selection field record value yield value
Some language may provide facility enumerate field record least field reference
This facility needed implement certain service
It requires degree
In system record subtyping operation value record type may also include In setting specific record type implies specific set field present value type may contain additional field
A record field would thus belong type record field would record field
The rationale passing record function expects record argument work since function find field requires within record
Many way practically implementing record programming language would trouble allowing variability matter central characteristic record type theoretical context
Most language allow assignment record exactly record type including field type name order
Depending language however two record data type defined separately may regarded distinct type even exactly field
Some language may also allow assignment record whose field different name matching field value corresponding field variable position within record example field called assigned record variable field
In alternative two operand still required sequence field type
Some language may also require corresponding type size encoding well whole record assigned uninterpreted
Other language may flexible regard require value field legally assigned corresponding variable field example field assigned field vice versa
Other language may match field value name rather position
These possibility apply comparison two record value equality
Some language may also allow order comparison using based comparison individual field
allows preceding type assignment also allows record structure terminology
In Algol array record integer field one could write obtain array integer consisting field element
As result statement would effect
In command would execute command sequence field record declared variable
So instead writing one could write
The representation record memory varies depending programming language
Usually field stored consecutive position memory order declared record type
This may result two field stored word memory indeed feature often used access specific bit word
On hand compiler add padding field mostly invisible programmer order comply alignment constraint imposed field must occupy single word
Some language may implement record array address pointing field possibly name type
Objects language often implemented rather complicated way especially language allow
A type record contains information identify record type locate information within record
It may contain offset element element therefore stored order may omitted
Alternatively various element record including element identifier simply follow one another order
The following show example record definition

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

Databases used organise data clear consistent way
Most website online application use database
With much data shared online data security important issue
The actual unit data entered give
These unit data also called
When create database need set data type
For example film database might need alphabetical character number
Fields usually restricted certain data type
way classifying data value common property
Different kind data value also need different amount store different operation performed upon
The data type In database programming language data type set follows The structure also called
When design database need create schema explain type data stored
There key area consider data Before creating database need think purpose
What database going used
What search might performed
In film table example structure table would If creating database people data type would use capture someone age
It would best capture age date birth DATE data type eg
An alternative would capture age number like
However need think database
If input someone age need update every time someone year older
This would inefficient time consuming
It would much better enter date birth

In data several part known divided
arrange data set also called
Each record consists several field record form
Examples field name gender hair colour
In also called within
In case regular field also called instance object example class field one distinct name per employee
A static field also called one variable shared instance
Fields abstracted allow read written field translated getter setter method call
Fields contain fixed number bit known fixed length field
A four byte field example may contain bit binary integer plus sign bit bit
A byte name field may contain person name typically padded blank end
The disadvantage using fixed length field part field may wasted space still required maximum length case
Also field omitted padding missing field still required maintain fixed start position within record instance
A variable length field always physical size
Such field nearly always used text field large field vary greatly length
For example bibliographical database like many small field publication date author name also abstract vary greatly length
Reserving field length would inefficient would enforce maximum length abstract space would wasted record particularly many article lacked abstract entirely
Database implementation commonly store field special way order make record given type uniform small size
Doing help performance
On hand data form stored typical file system transmitted across network usually us quite different performance strategy
The choice depends factor total size record performance characteristic storage medium expected pattern access
Database implementation typically store variable length field way If field often empty additional optimization come play

also called collection data specially organized rapid search retrieval
Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary
early adopter computer database technology
In United States National Crime Information Center NCIC established police record subsequently computerized made available police agency throughout country
The NCIC database enables local police department apprehend offender might otherwise evade advent database marketing individual customer characteristic purchase history retained company information system

Learn without computer programming language
Includes exercise
As begin writing real code one first thing must familiarize variable close cousin constant
A variable according name something allows value vary
In programming use variable store data run program
A variable contrasted constant whose value allowed change
In programming use constant store information know never going change
Even though variable constant may sound different semantically reality quite similar
We start studying constant look variable variable easier understand understood constant
My name Erik I think fair say constant never ever change
The absolute zero temperature also constant never change either
The number second one hour constant well never change always second hour
A constant purpose computer programming consists two thing name value
The name clearly illustrate constant le
The value actual value constant example absolute zero number second hour
In programming book name constant uppercase letter
This allows u clearly identify constant soon run code thus able distinguish variable written using lower case letter
A constant created using const reserved word followed constant data type followed constant name finally followed sign value
Let create constant see look like
What would appropriate name constant example
Names variable constant always programmer suggestion For worry meaning int uint
They data type explain later
When picking name constant variable want expressive order reduce risk ambiguity also absolutely fine use abbreviation long name take whole screen
For example NBR nbr common abbreviation number one see lot
There another rule pick name name must consist alphanumerical character
well underscore
You use underscore separate word become legible
In programming term initialize two constant
When initialize constant variable two thing Constants useful want set value repeat many location inside program
If use constant rather wrote several different location program wherever wanted refer absolute zero ever wanted change different number would change multiple location rather one
According Murphy law saying anything go wrong go wrong
This usually recipe disaster often even forgot change one value could lead strange error run program
By declaring constant allows u easily change value constant time run program change code one location opposed many reduces risk introducing error code
Variables similar constant main difference constant change assigned value variable oftentimes
We define variable similar fashion define constant instead using reserved word const use var
Let introduce concept called declaration
Declaration thought initialization without giving variable value
When declare variable simply inform computer intention use variable program computer allocate memory
Sometimes may prefer give variable value immediately language typically older language actually forced declare variable beginning code regardless code intend use
In modern language best practice indicate preferable declare initialize variable close possible first use concept declaration significant anymore used
Still educational purpose let declare variable designed store current temperature That variable available use code change value many time like
In fact variable value often changed many time program sometimes even million time
Let say programming teacher asked write program simulates rolling dice time end sum roll present number screen
Your teacher instructed keep track progress using variable
How many variable might need
In case would need one variable keep track sum one keep track many time rolled dice
We might therefore start initializing variable start program yet rolled dice hence sum Remember initialize variable declare give type name well give value
We would also initialize variable yet rolled dice
Each time program roll dice would add number displayed dice variable
After first dice roll might second might third might etc
The point always keep track total sum roll name indicates
Also time rolled dice would increment stop running program reached
It noted program stop running variable constant respective value lost
That typically program print information screen otherwise output save result run program preserve result
Just like may able describe word English certain type personal name number etc variable constant computer programming language
For example English might classified number whereas Steve Elon Larry Mark might classified name
Computers use similar type require bit granularity
We therefore familiarize two common data type programming integer string
Integers simply number without decimal
Integer variable take negative positive value referred signed integer
Signed refers fact minus sign front
Integer variable take positive value referred unsigned integer
When initialized wrote We picked unsigned integer type written uint know dice roll sum never negative
The reason picking unsigned integer choose roll dice many many time unsigned integer contain twice large number signed integer
The explanation simple signed integer unsigned integer allocated space memory signed integer however half capacity minus sign half unsigned integer capacity minus sign
Whether declare integer variable signed unsigned depend circumstance although time probably end using signed integer give flexibility
When learning programming theory however dealing large number worth noting difference signed unsigned integer
In example must use signed integer written int since must allow negative cash flow
We initialize signed integer variable following way The bit smallest unit information stored computer memory
A bit take one two value
An integer variable stored memory using one bit typically bit modern computer
The bit allocated integer higher largest value
The general formula many value integer take n equal number bit
This mean integer take two different value integer take four different value integer take value etc
The string second data type get know
Strings programming basically said equal text plain English
Here example string note use keyword string indicate declaring string All variable string variable set equal text surrounded quote
The quote fact one requirement string
Without quote would string
Whether use double quote single quote considered equivalent purpose book Pete equivalent Pete
We know properly refer left sign learned called either variable constant
This begs obvious question far right sign
The answer literal
In example say Pete string literal integer literal
A literal anything written directly code example text number
Literals show many location code right sign
Both integer string would somewhat uninteresting perform operation
By operation point referring arithmetic integer
adding subtracting dividing multiplying string concatenation string
joining two string together
A example operation performed integer follow We start initializing two unsigned integer data type uint number minus sign front
We purchase ice cream reduce accordingly
Note simply applying basic algebra
Our variable value
Let say get lucky find street proceed donate half wallet charity Our variable value
Let turn attention string operation
In section discus concatenation
Concatenation act combining two string
For example concatenated two string Programming class would end Programming class
Here concatenate two string value Erik Linde
As see simply use sign want concatenate string
Observe empty space inserted two string

Alternatively referred section code used used object module program created
The object module contain specific function enabling device computer

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
many part
These may include
Each part given name called
Every part must unique identifier
If programmer want create function procedure program part one must also given different identifier
Identifiers made unique two way Identifiers may case meaning throughout whole program meaning everywhere
Or identifier may case meaning within small part program may defined different meaning different place
Identifiers may also case meaning throughout single module file
This allows u use name different place refer different thing
These name actually different identifier even though casual reader might think
We safely divide programming project smaller component programmer writing one component may choose name local component without worrying name chosen programmer writing component
Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

technique emphasizes separating functionality independent interchangeable contains everything necessary execute one aspect desired functionality
A module interface express element provided required module
The element defined interface detectable module
The contains working code corresponds element declared interface
Modular programming closely related goal facilitating construction large software program system decomposition smaller piece originating around
While historically usage term inconsistent today modular programming refers decomposition code entire program piece structured programming code use structured programming use kind
In programming use interface architectural pattern construct module known
The term like sometimes used instead
In implementation distinct concept package collection module upcoming introduction collection package enhanced access control planned
Furthermore term package us software example
A similar concept typically refers higher level component piece whole module piece individual program
The scale term module varies significantly language Python file module planned module collection package turn collection file
Other term module include used dialect
Languages formally support module concept include CL Morpho several derivative
Conspicuous example language lack support module Pascal original form
As module proposed module added Pascal superseded Modula Oberon included module start various derivative included module
native module since
Modular programming performed even programming language lack explicit syntactic feature support named module
For example also us module programming ILE
With modular programming module perform logically discrete function interacting interface
Often module form DAG case cyclic dependency module seen indicating single module
In case module form DAG arranged hierarchy module independent depending module module depend one
A particular program library module hierarchy turn seen module program library system
When creating modular system instead creating monolithic application smallest component whole several smaller module written separately composed together construct executable application program
Typically also separately via linked
A may perform construction
This make modular designed system built correctly far reusable traditional monolithic design since many module may reused without change project
This also facilitates breaking project several smaller project
Theoretically modularized software project easily assembled large team since team member creating whole system even need know system whole
They focus assigned smaller task claimed counter key assumption actually possible add developer late software making later still
Modular programming form subsystem particularly software library date early software system used
Modular programming per se goal modularity developed late analog concept
The term modular programming date least National Symposium Modular Programming organized Information Systems Institute July key concept SoC
Modules included original specification included extension early implementation later formalized
One first language designed start modular programming
Another early modular language Wirth drew Mesa well original Modula successor influenced later language particularly successor
Modula use like refer object module coincides notation access field record similarly attribute method object widespread seen C Dart Go Java Python among others
Modular programming became widespread original language include module later version notably included form unit
The Extended Pascal ISO standard kept closer modular support
one complete module system including parameterized module map module
In modular programming overshadowed often conflated particularly due popularity Java
For example C family language support object class originally supporting module year later
Java support module form package though primary unit code organization class
However Python prominently used module object start using module primary unit code organization package unit includes support module object vast array module available
Modular programming widespread found virtually major language developed since
The relative importance module varies language language still overlap confusion class unit organization encapsulation distinct concept

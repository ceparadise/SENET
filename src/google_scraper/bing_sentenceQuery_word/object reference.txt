In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

This question already answer What Object Reference variable java
Does reference variable hold memory address object
I confused
Please explain
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
I sure I elegance properly answer What Object Reference variable java
Simply variable whose type object type
type either subtype
Does reference variable hold memory address object
Probably yes possibly
It depends JVM represents object reference
In JVMs object reference represented behind scene using memory address pointer
But also represented index array something else
Indeed I messed around experimental JVM object reference actually index array pointer
The point Java object reference abstraction representation implementation detail
The actual representation concern since matter program pure Java
You ca get hold actual memory address pure Java good thing
The JVM specifically garbage collector liable change object actual memory address without telling
If application could obtain use object address would need deal fundamentally difficult problem
Object Reference variable like pointer c exactly pointer
Its depend upon JRE provide JRE treated like pointer JRE treated pointer pointer

Java platform independent language memory management different different device difficult give unique way reach object
yes Object reference variable hold memory location real object In Java object referred reference instance The example reference object foo

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

I need concise definition state object programming paper
For half day I searched paper I cite topic I could find one
All paper I found mostly general paper programming define state object
I unsure best guess something like I searching definition state object reference topic
btw could I refer concept object state uncommon
You take look cite book And whole subsection describes concept You would also want keep mind state object abstract entity determined observable method
For instance object implement hash table state stored hash table internal representation detail
An system integrates term code data using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Hence state object instance variable inside object contains data
IBM defines word state several different definition similar one another
They specifically state related Object Oriented Programming one extrapolate use context
Def A stage lifecycle object identifies status object
Def A condition situation life object satisfies condition performs activity wait event
Def An object characteristic manifested public private data member divided two category essential state state
Def In business state machine one several discrete individual stage organized sequence compose business transaction
Def A condition circuit remains application suitable pulse
Webster New World College Dictionary defines A set circumstance attribute characterizing person thing given time way form condition The common denominator time
State change time progress
That nature variable
If someone ask What current state
You could say today married tomorrow could single
Considering definition one extrapolate way object exists particular point time determined value attribute namely
I think get simpler
By posting answer agree

measuring output particular procedure modifying process procedure increase increase increase effectiveness process procedure
Performance improvement applied either individual performance athlete organizational performance racing team commercial business
In performance improvement organizational change put place manage program measure current level performance organization generates idea modifying put place achieve higher output
The primary goal organizational improvement increase improve ability organization deliver good service
A third area sometimes targeted improvement involves process setting organizational goal objective
Performance improvement operational individual level usually involves process
At organizational level performance improvement usually involves softer form measurement survey used obtain qualitative information performance viewpoint customer
The published describes various process tool individual organizational level
Performance measure result achieved
Performance efficiency ratio effort expended result achieved
The difference current performance theoretical performance limit performance improvement zone
Another way think performance improvement see improvement four potential area
First resource input requirement reduced material replacement reorder time requirement
Second THROUGHPUT requirement often viewed process efficiency measured term time waste resource utilization
Third OUTPUT requirement often viewed quality functionality perspective
Fourth OUTCOME requirement end making difference
Performance abstract concept must represented concrete measurable phenomenon event measured
athlete performance abstract covering many different type activity
concrete measure particular performance attribute particular game role batting game baseball
Performance assumes actor kind actor could individual person group people acting concert
The performance platform infrastructure device used performance act
There two main way improve performance improving measured attribute using performance platform effectively improving measured attribute modifying performance platform turn allows given level use effective producing desired output
For instance several sport technological improvement apparatus used sport
The improved apparatus turn allows player achieve better performance improvement skill purchasing new equipment
The apparatus provide player higher theoretical performance limit
In study innate human need renowned psychologist concept hierarchy need identified esteem social fulfillment garnered recognition family peer basic human need therefore able tied structured program increase performance
Abraham Maslow Third Force psychology combine aspect behavioral cognitive emotional psychology account impact culture society behavior
In business human performance sale operation employee engagement able improved psychologically rewarding experience trigger host intrinsic human emotion behavior identified
Including reward performance improvement solution proven strategy engage employee align company goal
Awards cash
Both stimulate human behavior
The addition award total reward package creates unique manner unlocking performance potential people separate reward used perceived ordinary salary income
award break clutter motivate higher achievement drive greater return investment
Cash reward also spent item like food gas create increased psychological reward achieving special item point acquire item
By connecting level organization complete reward package amplify performance across organization bring personal goal alignment organizational goal
Reward program supporting improvement sale operation effectively paid increase revenue profit flow program without spending reward current level
There substantial evidence monetary reward effective outside context
In case monetary incentive plan may decrease employee morale Microsoft system total reward amount fixed employee graded artificially fitted distribution Performance improvement occur different level improvement thought

Including right people improvement team critical successful improvement effort
Teams vary size composition
Each organization build team suit need
First review aim
Second consider system relates aim What system affected improvement effort
Third sure team includes member familiar different part process manager administrator well work process including physician pharmacist nurse worker
Finally team need executive sponsor take responsibility success project
Effective team include member representing three different kind expertise within organization system leadership technical expertise leadership
There may one individual team kind expertise one individual may expertise one area three area represented order drive improvement successfully
Teams need someone enough authority organization test implement change suggested deal issue arise
The team clinical leader understands clinical implication proposed change consequence change might trigger part system
A technical expert someone know subject intimately understands process care
An expert improvement method provide additional technical support helping team determine measure assisting design simple effective measurement tool providing guidance collection interpretation display data
A leader driver project assuring test implemented overseeing data collection
It important person understands detail system also various effect making change system
This person also need able work effectively physician champion

A example process might include A lot
Let give example overused standard process definition describe process fails project
At ESPN basic process submitting background check new hire
The process described The process seems straightforward little room error
However hiding underneath basic definition key piece information illuminate problem process improvement solution
Timing interdependency key understanding real process behavior
In background check process described submitter submitted background check Tuesday PM
That mean pending background check could sit queue day submitted

Hello I disagree article
I think confusion process procedure method used execute process
A process describes input output expected deliverable end transformation
The procedure describes use entry order produce expected outcome
The timing problem mentioned solved good description procedure
Ernesto thank comment
You correct flowchart describes input output expected deliverable
A process model provides added information may yet acquainted
A process model add dimension time process
The dimension time allows understanding thing happen
A working process model open new level understanding process currently operates may operate change
Once operation process understood great procedure written
To help see may missing I would love provide personal demonstration process model using ProcessModel

Health Catalyst stand highest overall score healthcare BI market Posted
Few people influence science practical application process management
His impact automotive industry legendary many industry tried varying degree success implement principle well
For year I followed admired tried bring quality improvement process healthcare
I strongly believe healthcare much gain successfully implementing key Deming principle
Let share five principle I believe make biggest difference
When Deming others developed approach modern quality improvement basically developing way modern organization deal complex challenge confronting
The approach developed improvement remarkably simple yet extraordinarily powerful
It centered fact quality improvement really process management
These quality improvement concept technique used transform almost every major industry world dramatic result
The last holdout last passion resistance primarily healthcare higher education government
Now happening healthcare
I believe higher education imminent anyone guess whether government ever succumb force
Now know healthcare complex fundamentally different industry
Healthcare simply consists thousand interlinked process result complex system
If focus process care one time fundamentally change game deal challenge facing healthcare
Now may seem like tall order tell u probably percent process get u percent impact
So challenge every organization identify percent roll sleeve begin important work addressing challenge
Deming clearly understood importance data
Meaningful
This particularly true quality control healthcare
You basically dead water try work healthcare provider good data
I think everybody recognizes
Deming said In God others must bring I love quote reflects reality
I physician career tell pretty much thing quite polite
They basically say Dr
Haughom John get lost
Bring data
And decide believe So data critical going meaningful impact healthcare
An important application clarification Deming principle put forward good friend
Managing care mean managing process care
It mean managing physician nurse
What James said true
One big mistake made managed care movement naively thinking managing care meant telling physician nurse
The reality need process understand care delivery process best equipped figure improve process care time
And reason I strongly believe change fact ultimately empowering clinician try get involved
If clinician going manage care need data
They need right data delivered right format right time right place
And data must delivered right clinician involved operating improving given process care
If quality improvement going work going realize mean must engage clinician
To use Deming term clinician healthcare smart They frontline worker understand process care
And I said earlier slide fortunate healthcare workforce dominated clinician extraordinarily committed intelligent highly educated
But live pristine time
I received email fellow physician leader leading national delivery system
I going withhold name delivery system I tell ask knowledgeable people list top delivery system country almost everyone would put organization list
Despite physician wrote lamenting difficult get peer physician see new future
And email succinctly described problem saying physician historically encumbered And I love succinctness description basically saying clinging past demoralized see new future
And short phrase excellent physician leader pretty much encapsulated problem point u towards solution
A clearly demonstrates majority physician fact willing change
McKinsey US physician found percent said willing change reasonable course argument could made change necessary
So reconcile
I believe need help clinician figure give past helping see new future help understand role creating sustaining new future
In fact I believe one make strong case future empowering clinician type successfully inform engage inspire
Applying key Deming principle healthcare process improvement help every healthcare organization show workforce change necessary need understand participate meaningful change success ultimately look like
Would like use share concept

rapid application development RAD describes set value principle requirement solution evolve collaborative effort
It advocate adaptive planning evolutionary development early delivery continuous improvement encourages rapid flexible response change
These principle support definition continuing evolution many
The term sometimes written popularized defines value principle
Agile continue evolve two widely used
Iterative incremental software development method traced back
Evolutionary project management adaptive software development emerged early
During number software development method evolved reaction prevailing method critic described heavily regulated planned
These included DSDM Crystal Clear XP
Although originated publication collectively referred agile software development method
At time similar change underway manufacturing aerospace
In seventeen software developer met resort discus lightweight development method among others
Together published
In group headed wrote addendum principle guide software project management according agile software development method
In movement wrote extension principle guide agile software development according conduct mastery
In Agile Alliance created Guide Agile Practices renamed Agile Glossary evolving compendium working definition agile practice term element along interpretation experience guideline worldwide community agile practitioner
Based combined experience developing software helping others seventeen signatory manifesto proclaimed value That value item right value item left
By term meant Some author formed Agile Alliance organization promotes software development according manifesto value principle
Introducing manifesto behalf Agile Alliance said The Agile movement fact many u want restore credibility word methodology
We want restore balance
We embrace modeling order file diagram dusty corporate repository
We embrace documentation hundred page tome
We plan recognize limit planning turbulent environment
Those would brand proponent XP SCRUM Agile Methodologies hacker ignorant methodology original definition term hacker
The based twelve principle Most agile development method break product development work small increment minimize amount planning design
Iterations sprint short time frame typically last one four week
Each iteration involves working function
At end iteration working product demonstrated stakeholder
This minimizes overall risk allows product adapt change quickly
An iteration might add enough functionality warrant market release goal available release minimal end iteration
Multiple iteration might required release product new feature
Working software primary measure progress
No matter development method followed every team include Product Owner Scrum
This person agreed stakeholder act behalf make personal commitment available developer answer question throughout iteration
At end iteration stakeholder customer representative review progress priority view optimizing ROI ensuring alignment customer need company goal
In agile software development normally large physical display located prominently near development team see
It present summary product development status
A may also used inform team current status product development
A common characteristic agile software development also known
In brief session team member report previous day toward team iteration goal intend today toward goal roadblock impediment see goal
Specific tool technique automated technique often used improve quality enhance product development agility
Compared traditional software engineering agile software development mainly target complex system product development dynamic characteristic
Accurate estimate stable plan prediction often hard get early stage confidence likely low
Agile practitioner seek reduce needed evidence value obtained
Requirements design held emergent
Big specification would probably cause lot waste case economically sound
These basic argument previous industry experience learned year success failure helped shape agile development favor adaptive iterative evolutionary development
Development method exist continuum
Agile software development method lie side continuum
One key adaptive development method approach schedule planning identifies milestone leaf flexibility path reach also allows milestone change
method focus adapting quickly changing reality
When need project change adaptive team change well
An adaptive team difficulty describing exactly happen future
The away date vague adaptive method happen date
An adaptive team report exactly task next week feature plan next month
When asked release six month adaptive team might able report mission statement release statement expected value cost
method contrast focus analysing planning future detail cater known risk
In extreme predictive team report exactly feature task planned entire length development process
Predictive method rely effective early phase analysis go wrong project may difficulty changing direction
Predictive team often institute ensure consider valuable change
used choose adaptive predictive method
suggest side continuum follows One difference agile software development method waterfall approach quality testing
In always separate however agile software development testing completed iteration programming
Because testing done every develops small piece frequently use new piece software validate value
After user know real value updated piece software make better decision software future
Having value retrospective software session typically iteration two team continuously adapt plan maximize value delivers
This follows pattern similar cycle work review retrospective change agreed upon
This iterative approach support rather mindset
This provides greater flexibility throughout development process whereas project requirement defined locked beginning making difficult change later
Iterative product development allows software evolve response change business environment market requirement
Because short iteration style agile software development also strong connection concept
In letter Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism agile software development calling yet another attempt undermine discipline software engineering translating Working software comprehensive documentation We want spend time coding
Remember real programmer write documentation
This disputed proponent agile software development state developer write documentation best way achieve relevant goal often better way achieve goal writing static documentation
state documentation Just Barely Good Enough JBGE much comprehensive documentation would usually cause waste developer rarely trust detailed documentation usually sync code little documentation may also cause problem maintenance communication learning knowledge sharing
wrote method Crystal considers development series game intends documentation enough help next win next game
The work product Crystal include use case risk list iteration plan core domain model design note inform choice however template document description necessarily vague objective clear next game
I always tend characterize team would want know joined team tomorrow
Agile software development method support broad range
Some focus practice XP pragmatic programming agile modeling focus managing flow work Scrum Kanban
Some support activity requirement specification development FDD seek cover full development life cycle DSDM
Popular agile software development framework include limited Agile software development supported number concrete practice covering area like requirement design modeling coding testing planning risk management process quality etc
Some notable agile software development practice include The Agile Alliance provided comprehensive online guide applying agile practice
In literature different term refer notion method adaptation including tailoring fragment adaptation method engineering
Method tailoring defined A process capability human agent determine system development approach specific project situation responsive change dynamic interplay context intention method fragment
Potentially almost agile method suitable method tailoring
Even method used purpose successfully tailored context
considered distinguishing characteristic agile method traditional software development method latter relatively much rigid prescriptive
The practical implication agile method allow product development team adapt working practice according need individual product
Practices concrete activity product part method framework
At extreme level philosophy behind method consisting number principle could adapted Aydin
Some approach Scrum extreme programming make need method adaptation explicit
With framework one principle single process fit every product development rather practice tailored need product
Mehdi Mirakhorli proposes tailoring practice provides sufficient guideline adapting practice
designed customizing XP
This practice first proposed long research paper APSO workshop ICSE conference currently proposed applicable method customizing XP
Although specifically solution XP practice capability extending methodology
At first glance practice seems category static method adaptation experience RDP Practice say treated like dynamic method adaptation
The distinction static method adaptation dynamic method adaptation subtle
Scrum designed method tailoring
Schwaber note Scrum methodology need enhancing
That got trouble first place thinking problem perfect methodology
Effort center change enterprise needed
Bas Vodde reinforces statement suggesting Scrum like traditional large methodology require pick choose element
It basic top add additional element localise contextualise use
Agile software development widely seen highly suited certain type environment including small team expert working challenge limitation encountered adoption agile software development method large organization understood
In response range strategy pattern evolved overcoming challenge development effort developer distributed development team amongst challenge several recognised framework seek mitigate avoid challenge
There many conflicting viewpoint whether effective indeed fit definition agile development remains active ongoing area research
When agile software development applied distributed setting team dispersed across multiple business location commonly referred distributed agile development
The goal leverage unique benefit offered approach
Distributed development allow organization build software strategically setting team different part globe virtually building software commonly referred model
On hand agile development provides increased transparency continuous feedback flexibility responding change
Agile software development method initially seen best suitable product development thereby excluded use regulated domain medical device pharmaceutical financial nuclear system automotive avionics sector etc
However last several year several initiative adaptation agile method domain
There numerous standard may apply regulated domain including
A number key concern particular importance regulated domain The framework particular received considerable attention
Two derived method defined Regulated Scrum SafeScrum
Although agile software development method used programming paradigm language practice originally closely associated environment Smalltalk Lisp later Java
The initial adopter agile method usually small team working unprecedented system requirement difficult finalize likely change system developed
This section describes common problem organization encounter try adopt agile software development method well various technique measure quality performance agile team
Organizations team implementing agile software development often face difficulty transitioning traditional method team agile process forced
These often termed commonly
Below common example A goal agile software development focus producing working software le documentation
This contrast waterfall model process often highly controlled minor change system require significant revision supporting documentation
However justify completely without analysis design
Failure pay attention design cause team proceed rapidly first significant rework required attempt scale system
One key feature agile software development iterative
When done correctly design emerges system developed commonality opportunity discovered
In agile software development similar description typically used define requirement short period time team commits specific goal
Adding story iteration progress detrimental good flow work
These added product backlog prioritized subsequent iteration rare case iteration could cancelled
This mean story expand
Teams must deal new information may produce additional task story
If new information prevents story completed iteration carried subsequent iteration
However prioritized remaining story new information may changed story original priority
Agile software development often implemented grassroots effort organization software development team trying optimize development process ensure consistency software development life cycle
By sponsor support team may face difficulty resistance business partner development team management
Additionally may suffer without appropriate funding resource
This increase likelihood failure
A survey performed VersionOne found respondent cited insufficient training significant cause failed agile implementation Teams fallen trap assuming reduced process agile software development compared methodology waterfall mean actual rule agile software development
Agile software development set prescribed methodology requirement
The responsible representing business development activity often demanding role
A common mistake product owner role filled someone development team
This requires team make decision prioritization without real feedback business
They try solve business issue internally delay work reach outside team direction
This often lead distraction breakdown collaboration
Agile software development requires team meet product commitment mean focus work product
However team member appear spare capacity often expected take work make difficult help complete work team committed
Teams may fall trap spending much time preparing planning
This common trap team le familiar agile software development team feel obliged complete understanding specification story
Teams prepared move forward story confidence iteration continue discover prepare work subsequent iteration often referred grooming
A daily standup focused timely meeting team member disseminate information
If occurs often involve certain team member potentially best use entire team time
If daily standup team start diving set aside discus usually immediately standup completes
One intended benefit agile software development empower team make choice closest problem
Additionally make choice close implementation possible use timely information decision
If team member assigned task others early process benefit localized timely decision making lost
Being assigned work also constrains team member certain role example team member A must always database work limit opportunity
Team member choose take task stretch ability provide opportunity
Another common pitfall scrum master act contributor
While prohibited Scrum methodology scrum master need ensure capacity act role scrum master first working development task
A scrum master role facilitate process rather create product
Having scrum master also multitasking may result many context switch productive
Additionally scrum master responsible ensuring roadblock removed team make forward progress benefit gained individual task moving forward may outweigh roadblock deferred due lack capacity
Due iterative nature agile development multiple round testing often needed
Automated testing help reduce impact repeated unit integration regression test free developer tester focus higher value work
Test automation also support continued required iterative software development
Allowing developer quickly run test confirm refactoring modified functionality application may reduce workload increase confidence cleanup effort introduced new defect
Focusing delivering new functionality may result increased
The team must allow time defect remediation refactoring
Technical debt hinders planning ability increasing amount unscheduled work production defect distract team progress
As system evolves important entropy system naturally increase
Over time lack constant maintenance cause increasing defect development cost
A common misconception agile software development allows continuous change however iteration backlog agreement work completed iteration
Having much result inefficiency queueing
The team must avoid feeling pressured taking additional work
Agile software development fix time iteration duration quality ideally resource advance though maintaining fixed resource may difficult developer often pulled away task handle production incident scope remains variable
The customer product owner often push fixed scope iteration
However team reluctant commit locked time resource scope commonly known
Efforts add scope fixed time resource agile software development may result decreased quality
The best agile practitioner always emphasized sound engineering principle
As result number best practice tool measuring performance agile software development team
The amongst others rate development five dimension product development duration risk novelty effort interaction
Other technique based measurable goal one study suggests used metric agility
There also agile determine whether team using agile software development practice Nokia test Karlskrona test point test
One early study reporting gain quality productivity business satisfaction using agile software development method survey conducted Shine Technologies November January
A similar survey State Agile conducted every year starting thousand participant around software development community
This track trend benefit agility lesson learned good practice
Each survey reported increasing number saying agile software development help deliver software faster improves ability manage changing customer priority increase productivity
Surveys also consistently shown better result agile product development method compared classical project management
In balance report feel agile development method still young enable extensive academic research success
The term agile management applied iterative incremental method managing design build activity engineering information technology business area aim provide new product service development highly flexible interactive manner based principle expressed
Agile X technique may also called
It variant submitted stage
The main difference agile iterative development agile method complete small portion deliverable delivery cycle iteration iterative method evolve entire set deliverable time completing near end project
Both iterative agile method developed reaction various obstacle developed sequential form project organization
For example technology project grow complexity end user tend difficulty defining long term requirement without able view progressive prototype
Projects develop iteration constantly gather feedback help refine requirement
Agile management also offer simple framework promoting communication reflection past amongst member
Teams using traditional waterfall planning adopted agile way development typically go transformation phase often take help agile coach help guide team smooth transformation
There typically two style agile coaching
Agile management approach also employed adapted within business government sector
For example within USAID employing collaborative project management approach focus incorporating CLA strategy iterate adapt programming
Agile method mentioned Project Lifecycle definition project life cycle also known agile method intended facilitate change require high degree ongoing involvement
Adaptive life cycle also iterative incremental differ iteration rapid usually week length fixed time
According Richet Research Fellow Institute Strategic Innovation Services approach leveraged effectively product project management general especially area innovation uncertainty
The end result product project best meet current customer need delivered minimal cost waste time enabling company achieve bottom line gain earlier via traditional approach
Agile software development method extensively used development software product use certain characteristic software object technology
However technique applied development product computer motor vehicle medical device food clothing music see
Agile software development method used
Some wider principle agile software development also found application general management strategy governance risk finance term agile business management
Under agile business management model agile software development technique practice principle value expressed across five domain
Agile software development paradigm used area life raising child
Its success child development might founded basic management principle communication adaptation awareness
Bruce Feiler claimed basic agile development paradigm applied household management raising child
In TED Talk Agile programming family paradigm brought significant change household environment kid dish taking trash decreasing child emotional outbreak inadvertently increased emotional stability
Agile methodology inefficient large organization certain type development
Many organization believe agile software development methodology extreme adopt hybrid approach mix element agile software development approach
Some method DSDM attempt disciplined way without sacrificing fundamental principle
The term Agile also criticized simply describes existing good practice new jargon promotes one size fit mindset towards development strategy wrongly emphasizes method result
organized celebration anniversary Snowbird Utah February gathering people involved original meeting since
A list undiscussable agile collected including aspect alliance failure limitation agile software development practice context possible cause commercial interest decontextualization obvious way make progress based failure limited objective evidence cognitive bias reasoning fallacy politics culture
As wrote The agile movement way bit like teenager checking constantly appearance mirror accepting criticism interested peer rejecting en bloc wisdom past past adopting fad new jargon time cocky arrogant

Feminists number distinct interest perspective science
The tool science crucial resource understanding nature impact prospect changing form oppression spirit feminist actively draw contribute research program wide range science
At time feminist identified science source locus gender inequality institution science long tradition excluding woman practitioner feminist critic science find woman gender broadly issue concern woman minority routinely marginalized subject scientific inquiry treated way reproduce stereotype closing circle scientific authority frequently served rationalize kind social role institution feminist call question
Feminist perspective science therefore reflect broad spectrum epistemic attitude toward appraisal science
These perspective range urging reform gender inequity institution science calling attention underrepresentation woman neglected question still embracing standard practice science engage critical constructive alternative program research varying degree aim transforming framework assumption methodology substantive content epistemic ideal shape science
The content perspective degree generate transformation depends type philosophical political commitment inform also nature science subject domain
Feminist perspective appear greater impact science deal object inquiry understood social human secondarily science object inquiry often characterized gendered term metaphorically analogy projectively gendered subject biological life science
Feminist perspective relevant science deal subject matter perspective vary substantially content critical import depending science particular research program engage
Feminist scientist critic analyst science articulate position range profound ambivalence respect enthusiasm science
At critical end spectrum lie famous indictment science Virginia Woolf declaration science would seem sexless man father infected
Lorraine Code express similar view level
She argues many epistemological ideal inform science androcentric origin subjected feminist scrutiny ideal found need reconstruction
The worry science superficially inadvertently question ask claim practice institution authority implication life woman marginalized within normative fundamentally sexist embody deep systematic gender bias woman interest perspective insight associated disvalued marginalized
On view science master tool use Audre Lorde phrase inevitably subvert attempt turn emancipatory least end
In fact implacably negative view science often attributed feminist embraced
The claim feminist categorically hostile science appears derive conviction feminism political stance inimical science
On view distinctive objectivity science depends shielding scientific inquiry influence contextual value interest sort feminist would bring bear
However understanding objectivity science begs question role value science assumes clear distinction epistemic value
Since late twentieth century research exploring role value science feminist scholar explicitly identify feminist nuanced understanding epistemic value interact shape science variety way including setting research agenda evaluating evidence justifying theory see example Douglas Kitcher Lacey Longino Solomon
However even one hold traditional understanding good science incorporate value except perhaps choice research question follow feminist scientific institution authority vested discipline identified scientific framework assumption specific methodology research feminist hostile science epistemic ideal presumed underpin science diverse assumption method associated specific research tradition
Many feminist embrace defend orienting ideal convention associated field work
Some focus chiefly equity issue often insisting gender bias institution science bear issue content method see section
Others make case redefining research priority without challenging existing research tradition aim extend well established mode inquiry question asked aspect otherwise well mapped subject domain neglected particular interest woman feminist
This selective appropriation tool method science traditionally understood also serf critical end feminist use expose correct gender bias content favored model theory background assumption
Advocates successor science project Sandra Harding describes often endorse epistemic ideal value freedom objectivity feminist accused repudiating
They insist feminist critique contribution science taken seriously precisely represent better science traditional sense
In practice circumscribed feminist critique critique argument applying tool science new research question localized critique sexism androcentrism specific claim method remedial research designed correct omission lead profound question science advocate initially intend see section
Even epistemically conservative critique expose depth pervasiveness gender bias best science well manifestly bad science Harding calling question neutrality conceptual framework within scientist work extension capacity standard research methodology ensure objectivity claim
Consequently feminist critique anywhere along spectrum epistemic attitude led radical standard good science including question neutrality method meant objectivity science
Conversely new question lead new research strategy new category analysis expanded repertoire explanatory hypothesis frequently result research program chart new domain inquiry see section
In end feminist initiative often reshape scientific practice process challenge orienting ideal see section
It epistemically significant critical reflection feminist intervention science undertaken internally practitioner external commentator scholar suggest interest angle vision feminist bring bear science play constructive role exposing error raising evidential standard generating innovative insight within science see section
Hence feminist critique pose fundamental challenge conviction contingent contextual value unavoidably corrupt capacity science generate credible knowledge
What constructive well critical feminist engagement demonstrate contextual value ineliminable scientific practice instrumental empirical explanatory success including capacity interrupt entrenched pattern understanding see section
The central epistemic challenge feminist conceptualize count success scientific inquiry term realistically capture capacity generate empirically rigorous explanatorily probative knowledge see section
The usefulness science emancipatory promise scientific inquiry resource understanding changing inequity depends precisely paradoxical epistemic character empirical inquiry science thoroughly social human undertaking bearing mark context origin interest practitioner yet capacity critically assumption interest belief constitute context motivate scientific inquiry
The diversity evident various feminist perspective science arises several dimension The result surprisingly highly diverse array feminist perspective science
Feminists challenged presumption science inherently masculine woman unfit science science unfit conviction institution science model meritocracy
Feminist historian science document entrenched historical pattern exclusion woman time recovering evidence woman active participation science often face stiff resistance
Analyses gendered structure contemporary science undermine explanation continued marginality woman show inequality persist representation recognition effective integration woman science even gain access training pipeline demonstrate aptitude scientific training make substantial contribution science
The historical research woman science suggests masculine profile science developed context last year mean monolithic inevitable
For example Londa Schiebinger argues elite woman woman involved tradition craft production seventeenth eighteenth century played active role early formation science
The best known noblewoman like Queen Christina Sweden Margaret Cavendish Duchess Newcastle Madame du Chatelet made contribution recognized peer denied membership scientific academy taking shape day
The emerging New Science st ood fork road respect inclusion woman Schiebinger argues became established defined monastic university tradition association aristocratic men excluded woman generally purged thing feminine Schiebinger chapter
The major academy science excluded woman Marie Curie denied membership French Academie de Sciences despite first person win two Nobel Prizes National Academy Sciences admitted first woman Florence Sabin French Academie elected Marguerite Perey assistant Marie Curie correspondent Academie Ramey Schiebinger
After woman first admitted university college slowly gained access training science
By thousand woman working variety field institution whereas sixty seventy year earlier ten early woman college Rossiter xviii
This achievement realized best effort host talented woman seeing science woman role changing around took step carve legitimate place new order Rossiter xviii
Nonetheless gain came price Margaret Rossiter describes pattern segregated employment underrecognition woman escaped Rossiter xviii served predominantly technician assistant computer populated woman college school home economics
Moreover gain proved vulnerable
The new order suffered sharp downturn conventional view social role appropriate woman regained prominence woman participation science declined paid job professional workforce generally year
It another twenty year woman regained level representation achieved science
Second wave feminist activism instrumental regaining building educational gain realized first wave feminism
These challenge continuing marginalization woman science many sphere professional public life resulted landmark legislation late early mandated equal opportunity employment education chief among Title IX Education Amendments extended Equal Pay Act higher education Rossiter
Women since made dramatic gain doubling quadrupling representation college graduate program science among employed scientist engineer
Taking science engineering discipline together NAS includes social life science well physical science engineering woman received PhD awarded science last thirty year since accounted bachelor degree awarded science
In woman awarded doctorate science engineering National Science Foundation Division Science Resource Statistics Survey Doctorate Recipients
The distribution degree discipline illustrates clearly majority gain
W omen earned almost half doctorate earth atmospheric ocean science chemistry math approximately doctorate computer science engineering physic AAUW
Since however growing concern gain woman science training pipeline translating comparable improvement representation faculty science leadership position science NAS ix one commentator put thirty year formal barrier participation struck representation woman among full professor still le well would expect given number doctorate awarded number year take move PhD full professor Greenwood
In academia whole woman continue concentrated insecure position lowest rank academic hierarchy despite growing representation PhD training pipeline inverted pyramid pattern primary target feminist challenge educational employment inequity proven stubbornly resistant change
This pattern distribution especially clear science
full professor science engineering woman compared across field
This disparity amplified top research institution woman make full professor science engineering
If compare percentage tenured female faculty percentage STEM doctorate awarded woman allowing year individual start academic job earn tenure STEM field pronounced
Even field like biology woman receive doctorate received percent woman make le tenured faculty percent faculty AAUW
This pattern reflected salary difference professional reward disparity type appointment rate promotion even range institutional type measure productivity taken account Ginther West Curtis
The question explain persistent inequality representation woman science focus intense controversy
Conventional account typically invoke talent drive preference woman
For example Jonathan Cole argued inequity employment status compensation reputational standing woman science best explained term training pipeline persist professional career lower level productivity accounted marital parental status short woman conform expectation even get necessary training
In statement generated intense public debate year later Larry Summers president Harvard reiterated intuition without backing systematic analysis kind Cole presented without responding wide range critique reassessment substantially undermined Cole claim intervening year
From outset feminist challenged specific Cole analysis assumption informed noting difficulty disentangling influence environment woman make choice natural inclination
Through growing body activist research documented came known chilly climate woman academic institution Hall Sandler The Chilly Collective Wylie Jakobsen Fosado
While overt intentional discrimination mean thing past report documented debilitating effect woman negotiate host subtle personal social barrier run along line gender difference often operate level awareness men woman Sandler Hall Sandler
The sort mechanism reported study include example pattern exclusion woman informal mentoring communication network within profession workplace work assignment channel woman heavy advising undergraduate teaching administrative position carry substantial organizational responsibility little power gendered pattern evaluation bias example accomplishment woman readily attributed luck external factor men treated evidence talent training hard work overview see Wylie Wylie Jakobsen Fosado
The insight central report pamphlet came prominence author MIT report Status Women Faculty Science declared woman continue face gender discrimination right era operate formal overt barrier participation mobilized activist
It take form diffuse persistent difference recognition response pattern powerful unrecognized attitude assumption work systematically woman despite good MIT
The MIT study documented systematic difference tangibles salary merit increment institutional response external job offer internal support research allocation office laboratory space well subtle difference service expectation teaching assignment influence woman decision affect worklife
Although various area may seem trivial taken individually translate pattern devaluation marginalization amplify trajectory career
The MIT study report pattern gender difference corroborated growing number quantitative study gender difference scientist career trajectory Ginther Sonnert Holton Xie Shauman small initial difference salary initial appointment workload compounded way substantial cumulative impact quality woman work life effectiveness workplace result significant difference career outcome compared similarly well trained accomplished men MIT
These form subtle discrimination primary target initiative designed redress Chair NAS Committee describes needle waste nation scientific talent Shalala NAS ix
For example figure prominently argument extending Title IX requirement equal opportunity education science training program Rolison Zare past chiefly applied inequity support sport
They also addressed project designed foster institutional transformation funded National Science Foundation ADVANCE program Program Advancement Women Academic Science Engineering Careers include range strategy counteracting evaluation bias allocation resource review researcher credential point hiring promotion tenure range decision making process link ADVANCE project see Internet Resources
The AAUW report review issue make recommendation counteract inequity science education
The report identifies three theme persist conventional explanation gender disparity STEM field
The first idea innate difference talent men typically better mathematical skill required success STEM field
The second idea drive preference differ girl simply le interested STEM discipline choose pursue STEM career
The third related sort described MIT study revolving around workplace including explicit implicit bias within workplace balance issue thought drive woman STEM field
As detailed conventional theme resurface periodically discussion gender inequity STEM field suggesting inevitability status quo
The AAUW report challenge standard explanation turn make suggestion designed address feature STEM education seem likely contribute persistent gender disparity
This study recommendation described good example way scientific research brought bear issue gender equity
The shift attention away overt discrimination towards cumulative effect small scale disadvantage exist everyday interaction social fabric scientific institution education culture generally represents highly consequential reframing issue advocate gender equity science struggling several decade
It converges increasingly draw inspiration empirical grounding several line demographic experimental social psychological sociological research developing since late
Yu Xie Kimberlee Shauman decisively challenge Cole claim woman demonstrate productivity deficit unrelated marital parental status chapter call question reliance later gender equity research rigid pipeline metaphor arguing le linear life course model provides better framework recognizing complex pattern delayed entry withdrawal reentry evident scientific training career path typical many woman
The experimental work cognitive psychologist social psychologist delineates set form cognitive schema heuristic play role automatic cognitive operate threshold conscious awareness generating pattern evaluation bias track gender also range dimension along social inequality constituted Steele Valian
Finally number ambitious longitudinal cohort study put sociologist historian science position refine model complex process generated operation automatic cognitive processing produce gender difference outcome
What taken shape last two decade fundamental reorientation understanding gendered nature scientific institution informs rooted critical perspective brought bear feminist
It longer assumed unless formal barrier access discriminatory intent established persistent marginalization woman science must attributed factor internal woman
As NAS AAUW report make clear preponderance evidence tell conventional explanation attribute woman inherent cognitive deficit lack drive commitment succeed science explanation form gender inequality persist science must take account effect training workplace environment inhospitable woman minority role various form evaluation bias operate threshold conscious awareness impact institutional structure fail counteract amplify disadvantage NAS AAUW xvi
These insight suggest gender inequity science expected resolve without concerted effort effort focus primarily adapting woman existing institution ensuring institution accountable changing entrenched practice responsible continued loss trained scientific talent
A primary focus effort realize institutional transformation sort outlined ADVANCE project mentioned counteract subtle form bias operate interaction workplace training mentoring relationship decision process throughout institution science education employment
In addition although many feminist scientist insist critique gender inequity way impugn epistemic integrity field good reason think systematic institutional bias affect content practice science
What form take vary widely field subfield depending example whether gender category constitutive subject domain case social science directly projected onto case animal behavior research
But even area physical science subject domain attributed gender characteristic metaphorical basis symbolically projectively gendered subject pattern workplace segregation run along gender line woman predominantly working particular subfields research niche gender difference recognition support funding citation pattern may well impact question given priority hypothesis get uptake result recognized bearing problem central research agenda discipline
What feminist share despite enormous internal diversity perspective concern understand change condition oppression operate along line gender difference
To realize goal necessary understand accuracy subtlety explanatory precision nature source oppression scientific inquiry one powerful tool available
Thus feminist interest research program address question particular concern woman feminist generally systematically disadvantaged traditional gender role social relation structured convention heterosexuality heteronormative convention
At conservative epistemically conceptually research initiative undertaken feminist challenge background assumption methodological commitment underpin existing program scientific research often goal expand range question addressed particular social medical biological science selectively appropriate tool scientific inquiry application research
Key example come medical science woman health movement pivotal educating woman redefining relationship health care professional bringing feminist critique activist pressure bear medical research chiefly focused ailment men taken male body disease profile norm medical diagnosis treatment woman
The feminist activism responsible making breast cancer primary focus war cancer one high profile example
Feminist advocacy played critical role challenging tradition medical practice made radical mastectomy treatment protocol choice much longer elsewhere
The clinical trial demonstrated efficacy le invasive alternative radical mastectomy model rigorous medical research Fischer trial described Lerner considerable pressure required convince medical establishment research needed take result seriously Lerner
More generally feminist activism responsible great awakening mainstream medicine woman health concern Schiebinger describes put pressure medical establishment direct attention neglected condition affect primarily woman osteoporosis breast cancer also take account way woman health disease profile diverge model based study male subject
Heart disease one especially prominent example well studied condition understanding based late almost entirely sample men even concerned effect hormone like estrogen Schiebinger
Feminist activism directly responsible federally enforced reform medical research instituted early required inclusion female subject clinical trial given finding drug routinely tested exclusively men publicly funded research woman largely limited reproductive health issue Schiebinger
The NIH guideline updated example result activism
A similar impulse evident much research undertaken feminist social science response feminist demand goal apply established research tool neglected question particularly concern woman feminist
These successor science tradition research faced stiff criticism internal feminism since least ground insufficiently critical scientific ideal animate many social science Harding continue thrive made substantial contribution number context
The sophisticated quantitative analysis career path pattern compensation professional outcome woman science described last section one example conventional social scientific method used good effect document persistent pattern discrimination institution purport meritocratic
Other example include wide range research aimed documenting designing effective strategy solving specific problem created gendered social institution cultural convention division labor
One strand research violence woman Greaves Wylie make use conventional demographic analysis show pattern violence class ethnic race religious identification aim effect change policing funding policy address domestic violence
Other action policy oriented research includes example study gender gap voting pattern gendered nature poverty differential impact development policy woman
Another productive tradition feminist research appropriative spirit characterized remedial research designed fill lacuna established theory body knowledge correcting error arise ignoring woman gender without changing term disciplinary engagement
For example woman entering anthropology unprecedented number quick recognize need compensatory ethnography
Sometimes male researcher scant access woman informant sometimes ignored discounted effect woman role relationship distinctive activity often strikingly absent ethnographic narrative
Claude famous description entered field journal illustrates problem entire village left next day thirty canoe leaving u alone abandoned house woman child cited Margrit Eichler Jeanne Lapointe
Deepening critique Shirley Edwin Ardener describe problem woman case ethnographic subject muted within society social anthropologist observe traditionally characterized society studied term dominant male system perception Ardener xiii study woman level little higher study duck fowl commonly Ardener say woman taken account insofar figured valued public language world men
Similar idea also reflected substantial shift focus field like primatology projected gender norm given rise general vision primate society revolves around male based aggression domination hierarchy Strum Fedigan
Here reorientation field observation practice brought focus central role played female primate society importance tactic aggression particularly rely social finesse management relationship making clear hierarchy may may place primate society male female equally capable competition Strum Fedigan see also Fedigan Fedigan
Even methodologically epistemically conservative feminist intervention correct specific error omission extend tool science neglected problem often generate deeply challenging question
The success remedial exercise make clear many field compromised unrecognized unintended bias way subject domain defined
When woman restored historical record sociological political anthropological account omitted eclipsed Smith relegated role Novick often become clear problem erasure systematic distortion
As critical reflection conceptual androcentrism deepened role ethnocentric gender norm structuring inquiry proven profound implication woman explicitly gendered subject conceived also ostensibly gender neutral aspect social historical subject various natural domain well
Specific critique research either ignore woman altogether assimilate norm expectation taken shape every field deal human subject
An example former come political science Pamela Paxton argues operationalizing democracy one key indicator universal suffrage often explicitly implicitly understood universal male suffrage
When universal suffrage includes woman Paxton note many key claim development standard interpretation identifies three wave need revised Paxton
Accounts make claim cause democracy rest classification three wave decision operationalize latent concept effect theoretical explanation
A critique taking male norm universal Carol Gilligan reassessment Lawrence Kohlberg model moral development account based exclusively sample boy
Kohlberg assumed developmental stage manifest sample could generalized girl expected conform took universal trajectory
Gilligan argued attend specific moral reasoning among girl distinctive trajectory moral development emerges characterized increasingly sophisticated contextual mode judgment diverges intermediate stage moral development decontextualized universalizing form moral reasoning Kohlberg found research boy
She make case recognizing difference voice evidence call question stage structure universalizing assumption fundamental system
Gilligan since criticized reproducing structure fixed developmental scheme taken Kohlberg developmental psychology generally ignoring impact moral reasoning range social economic factor gender
Nonetheless posit different voice represents decisive challenge androcentric presumption male experience perception pattern development treated normative human psychology whole
In context feminist content critique focus gender stereotype reflected converse assumption men woman categorically different
In case similar overlapping trait either ignored characterized different term associated men rather woman Eichler refers error arise imposing double standard sexual dichotomism
Examples practice widespread sex difference research field continues reproduce stereotype despite trenchant sustained critique Young Balaban
One consequential example research undertaken counteract interconnected error erasure distortion ethnographic work group long identified Ethnographers focused role activity woman group discovered among temperate desert dwelling subtropical forager small game plant resource provided woman gatherer may account much group total dietary intake
Ironically found small game collected woman described gathering whereas counted hunting activity attributed men
They learned well woman gatherer highly mobile like men social group limited home base control fertility extent previously acknowledged play leadership role presumed exclusive domain men particularly decision concern group movement subsistence strategy Slocum see also contribution Lee Devore overview Dahlberg Fedigan Fedigan
These finding part impetus rethinking model human evolution depended ethnographic model subsistence pattern social organization forager defined term role male hunter
In first instance inspired corrective woman gatherer model human evolution challenged assumption demand hunt shaped characteristic make u human Dahlberg
The reorientation primatology mentioned another source corrective pressure model human evolution case field subject inquiry projectively gendered
But research taken shape field predicated skepticism ethnocentric gender stereotype assumed hold contemporary forager much le diverse specie primate early hominid become increasingly clear antithesis problematic sexist androcentric model human evolution intended displace
Linda Marie Fedigan argues feminist resist tendency invert revalue category central system seems likely hominid ancestor lived social group utilized subsistence strategy unlike familiar contemporary ethnographic primatological research Fedigan
With reference primate model Sperling argues anthropomorphized langur lipstick improvement baboon briefcase contemporary gender new female primate dressed success life troop resembles modern corporation adequate framework understanding primate stereotype earlier era represented female passive coquette male aggressive strategist
She urge reassessment assumption naturalness role identity make anthropomorphic projection gender stereotype seem plausible
If come term complexity flexibility primate behavior must prepared set aside simplifying assumption especially characteristic like aggression concerned Sperling
Despite sustained critique convention taken common sense continue inform evolutionary theorizing
Elisabeth Lloyd describes pervasive androcentric sexist bias evolutionary explanation human female orgasm reflect uncritical acceptance entrenched assumption sexuality even author invoke result sexology research decisively disproves assumption also conviction trait must explicable adaptationist term often construed term transparently ethnocentric sexist assumption function capacity female orgasm fulfills must selected
Sarah Richardson also expose explores projective attribution gender way stereotypical idea male female trait shape research chromosome sex determination
She argues f rom earliest theory chromosomal sex determination midcentury hypothesis aggressive XYY supermale longstanding belief X female chromosome recent claim male female different genome cultural gender conception influenced direction sex chromosome genetics
As one example effect projection explores failed supermale idea XYY male maleness virtue two Y chromosome
Supermales hypothesized among thing aggressive
Their greater number institution psychiatric correctional seemed support
The gendering Y stereotypically male flawed transitive reasoning Y distinguishes maleness male double Y double
maleness aggression
The result false conclusion failure examine evidence support hypothesis
For example institutional population revealed also contain disproportionate number XXY male
If one us reasoning based gender stereotype evidence appears inconsistent supermale hypothesis
Ultimately hypothesis discredited variety reason embarrassment chromosomal sex determination research one example assumption gender shape understanding object inquiry
Richardson argues area research carry gender valence nuanced projective gendering subject matter subtle typically referred gender As example illustrate critique erasure distortion implication framework commitment explanatory repertoire conventional category description structured research many field throw relief aspect various subject domain left account prove inexplicable conceived term gender category norm behavior specific relatively narrow selection contemporary human social experience
For example Lloyd critique evolutionary theorizing female orgasm pose challenge specific explanatory theory considers broader culturally conventional assumption distinctively male female role sexual response behavioral predisposition underpin adaptationist research program wide range area aggressive promiscuous male coy passive female sociobiological theorizing populate explanation human trait ranging physical capacity orgasm psychology mate preference social pattern investment offspring also account behavior primate duck projectively even reproductive functioning biological organism like slime mold example discussed
Thus see even subject domain science intrinsically gendered case natural life science may projectively symbolically gendered gendered language concept may figure heuristic resource description phenomenon Spanier scientific category overtly gendered may gendered social meaning context formation Potter
To take latter case first Elizabeth Potter develops account role century gender politics shaping Boyle commitment mechanistic orientation ultimately yielded theory gas
His opposition radical politics associated animism alternative hylozoic theory informed choice orienting metaphysics also emerging norm experimental methodological example norm term theory assessed debated
Potter point gas law explicitly gendered formation ratification scientific deeply shaped articulation gender politics theological commitment specific century England
In analysis life science feminist show research reproductive physiology structured attribution stereotypically masculine trait sperm active agent feminine trait egg passive sometimes considerable cost empirical adequacy explanatory power Martin Spanier
Bonnie Spanier discerns influence metaphor molecular biology even subject human reproduction attribution sex difference Coli organism example
Here transfer genetic material one organism another characterized gendered term donor recipient cell labeled male female respectively transfer process described mediated conjugal union male female cell
This gendering level molecular phenomenon evident Spanier
But also see subtle sort gendering competing model factor control aggregation slime mold case analyzed Evelyn Fox Keller connection general critique force concept predetermined centralized control natural model relationship among component living system population Keller
By projecting causally familiar model model governance control reflect gender hierarchy society familiar risk imposing nature story like hear Keller
In short although specific feminist content critique necessarily quite different biological physical opposed social historical science follow similar trajectory
Even narrowly circumscribed corrective intervention often expose pattern omission distortion compromise detail framework assumption science examined
Discovery omission distortion lead critical question methodological standard epistemic ideal inform scientific practice
By feminist research exposed pervasive androcentric sexist bias called question bad science much pass good science even exemplary science see Longino Doell Harding Wylie
Feminist content critique thus pose two related challenge
If established scientific methodology routinely although always reproduce androcentric sexist bias generate bias question arises whether feminist could better feminist method debate took shape chiefly social science response question see section
By extension feminist critique contribution science suggest need reassess making sharp distinction contextual value interest consideration cognitive factor good reason evidence ideal truth objectivity understood constitutive science
Thus challenge feminist philosopher science include clarifying role value successful science articulating norm epistemic credibility conception account good science incorporates value
While time feminist skeptical capacity conventional research method expose systematic bias generally agreed plurality method productive achieving feminist goal
Nonetheless question related method feminist wanted explore
To understand stake may helpful use Harding distinction method methodology epistemology
Methods technique gathering evidence whereas methodology theory analysis research Epistemology theory knowledge justificatory strategy underlies methodology Harding
While quantitative qualitative mixed method research produced evidence science consistent feminist goal question raised possibility problematic epistemological presupposition underlying use particular method gather presupposition might inform methodology see section
For example scholar reject conviction social research must conform model natural scientific practice ground formulated term positivist theory science model entrench ruling practice form quantitative method reproduce category dominant ideology obscure devalued subordinate perspective Mies Smith Stanley Wise
This objection objection methodological framework within method employed
Although maintain research method intrinsically sexist androcentric feminist social scientist often found recover dimension social life ignored mainstream research often must use form evidence considered ephemeral diary private paper material culture opposed archive public record rely method marginal convention field qualitative method field dominated experimental quantitative mode inquiry inspired natural science
Nonetheless time mainstream quantitative method provide powerful resource making feminist argument section
Shulamith Reinharz review feminist social research method identified productive feminist application virtually every research method available social science end Heidi Gottfried concluded feminist practitioner made decisive move singularity plurality
Epistemic argument reinforced impulse toward plurality method
Sandra Harding Helen Longino argued justification positing distinctive female way knowing fruitful ask mean science feminist Longino recognize feminist research practice diverse commitment generate question address field feminist work
Thus current feminist method debate aptly characterized debate debate theoretical framework knowledge production within method used
Consistent idea feminist researcher converged around set commitment shape guide use method thus provide methodological framework
Four shared commitment particularly salient relevance experiential grounding accountability reflexivity Wylie
These commitment aid guiding research otherwise consistent feminist ideal Eichler Fonow Cook DeVault Yaiser
The first goal feminist research research feminist mean address question relevant woman generally oppressed system inequality many woman
Sometimes principle specifically formulated activist term feminist research sense provide understanding sexist institution also generate strategy changing institution Ehrlich
The commitment experiential grounding embodied directive variously formulated feminist start research life woman marginalized conventional structure
As articulated Dorothy Smith early subsequently elaborated Harding recommendation take woman everyday life starting point point research focus aspect social life form understanding typically remain eclipsed normatively masculine focus conventional social science Smith
The feminist research straightforwardly exemplifies ideal community project research undertaken woman woman woman Gorelick experience concern give rise directly question asked
Examples include chilly climate workplace environment research discussed section study need homeless poor woman kind supported Vancouver Women Research Center Jacobson undertaken Roofless Women twenty year later
The principle inform inquiry motivated explicitly activist objective designed aim leveling hierarchy authority inherent traditional expert form social scientific also inspired robust tradition participatory research associated woman shelter movement described Patricia Maguire classic account Maguire Naples connection study woman invisible work research adult survivor childhood sexual abuse Naples
In context ongoing debate status authority evidence experience Scott second feminist research start grounded woman reframed commitment treat gendered experience critical resource stage research Wylie
The commitment accountability lead specification ethical pragmatic norm feminist research include accountability research subject variety way
Minimally research process exploit demean research subject oppressed system ideally empower
Often feminist hold higher standard arguing research practice site instituting feminist social political value designing research project counteract hierarchical structure make social science ruling practice implementing egalitarian participatory form knowledge production
Here feminist principle converge ideal inform number research tradition emphasize participatory mode inquiry explicitly primarily feminist orientation set general argument inclusive norm research practice Longino developed see section
For example practitioner participatory action research PAR community based collaborative research CBPR field diverse forestry Fortmann Wilmsen et
al development Hickey Mohan community health Minkler Wallerstein make case commitment emancipatory goal requires research address relevant question
In addition like many feminist argue commitment accountability reciprocity requires ideal research subject involved stage research design data collection analysis authorship
The rationale moral fully collaborative practice exemplifies thoroughgoing diffusion decentralization power Longino describes feminist community value work social norm reinforce tempered equality intellectual authority inclusive mode critical engagement scientific community instrumental epistemic end Longino
Although point departure delineation commitment characteristic feminist research Longino developed set entirely general argument norm ensure epistemic resource diverse perspective brought bear critical assessment research method evidence inference well claim based
Given unconditioned subjectivity view nowhere unattainable argues basis ratifying knowledge claim integrity process knowledge production assessed jointly social cognitive norm
Finally commitment outlined entail feminist researcher make reflexivity central virtue
A strength feminist critique lie uncovering previously hidden androcentric assumption
Thus feminist social scientist bring research awareness need contextualize research
As Shulamith Rheinharz put state premise rather hide unlike approach critique
The interest motivate choice question assumption underpin hypothesis consider reason adopting particular method inquiry category description analysis explicit
On stronger formulation commitment cultivate stance critical reflexivity requires feminist take account various way socially defined angle vision interest value constitutive research process understanding produce Fonow Cook Mies
Harding elaborated term requirement strong objectivity Strong objectivity requires subject knowledge placed critical plane object knowledge
Thus strong objectivity requires think strong reflexivity Harding section
At Longino argued case governing principle methodological provisionalism feminist prepared revise norm light learn practice
While principle critical reflexivity provisionalism Longino suggests bottom line proviso inform application feminist basis adopting assessing revising methodological norm inform feminist research commitment prevent gender disappeared
In articulating principle feminist practitioner often work insider discipline whose method result critique far cynically dismissive scientific inquiry committed improving epistemic credibility integrity research practice field
The challenge engage practical methodological term showing ineliminable contextual value resource better science
Science Studies interdisciplinary field draw upon anthropology cultural study economics feminism history philosophy political science sociology order study science
Historian Mario Biagioli xii defines science study field asks science work rather science describes science study using variety methodology research question find science work
For example anthropologist Sharon Traweek compared two community high energy physicist asking forged research community turn novice physicist community work produce David Hess characterizes science study tracking history discipline dynamic science social institution philosophical basis scientific knowledge
And sociologist Emma Whelan characterizes science study focusing social factor science science scientific work Whelan italic original
Though definition offered science scholar differ nevertheless agree focus science study interaction science society including micro macro interaction
A fundamental aim science study critique narrow understanding science rational activity instantiating logic science show variety perspective science social activity

When science first identified masculine basis many asked whether implies feminine science woman would science differently men
The idea feminine science helped challenge idea science masculine endeavor focused analytical gaze feminine aspect intuition collaboration social network
In general feminist science study scholar contributed gender analysis address issue power inequality variety knowing knower discourse materiality subjectivity objectivity embodiment representation work resistance divide Whelan
In addition feminist science study scholar try understand relationship among science gender race class sexuality disability colonialism science construct applies difference

See sample work scholar
Hilary Rose note critical work becomes theoretical fully elaborated woman woman interest recede For example Evelyn Fox Keller observes feminist scholar first questioned objectivity science question later appropriated mainstream historian science
This could explain impact feminist science study scholar field science study inception field late decrease obviously feminist science scholarship two main journal science study
Eulalia Pérez Sedeño critique science study employing serious gender analysis skeptical constructively critical account science challenge mainstream science study include private sphere well high profile public sphere location research
In way scholar called closer engagement feminist theory feminist science study
For example special issue edited Susan Squier Melissa Littlefield suggests closer examination materiality agency performance feminist science study could create point mutual interest feminist theory feminist science study
Since inception feminist science study unified field
The category feminist science study includes feminist critique science history woman science attention equity issue woman science experience woman science effect science woman cultural construction gender feminist theory scientific knowledge
Under rubric gender science culture find scholar discussing marginalization woman science raising question equity science analyzing gendered nature science questioning construction scientific knowledge
These various dialogue multiple direction create disparate subspecialties give appearance feminist science study diaspora
Research feminist science study found anthropology biology cultural study ethnic study history science literary study philosophy science philosophy postcolonial study sociology study among discipline
Thus field diverse methodology approach research
This strength weakness
Most feminist science study scholar identify primarily traditional discipline secondarily feminist science study make difficult distinguish work field
But diverse method approach also give field flexibility diversity breadth depth
Thus Banu Subramaniam Hammonds Subramaniam celebrates field feminist science study allows possibility construction collaboration addition critique
Finally despite diversity method approach scholar address relationship science gender also relationship science race class sexuality disability colonialism ask science used construct apply difference
The early feminist science scholar addressed number binary prevalent scientific discourse reflected contemporary thinking belief science
Feminist science scholar alone questioning binary modernity first science work contributed critical analysis scientific culture
Ruth Hubbard work illustrated science reflects value science privileged educated white men defined count
Susan Griffin Carolyn Merchant explored discourse historical cultural analysis illustrate value nature feminine science masculine permeated modern science
Donna Haraway explored assumption concerning binary analysis gender racial bias primatology
Sandra Harding work illustrated science produce meaning constructed
Helen Longino Ruth Doell documented masculine bias within evolutionary endocrinological research
Luce Irigaray showed scientific language neutral needed interpreted sexed logic
These binary longer major focus feminist science study critique mainstreamed theory social construction science
However distinction still actively explored Suchman Barad Hammond Goodman speaks boundary human machine address question difference engaged feminist scholarship since inception
Scholarship explores scientific knowledge constructed inside outside laboratory application knowledge life body woman central focus feminist science study
Turning first production knowledge based account Rosalind Franklin Maddox Barbara McClintock Keller Ruth Hubbard concluded relationship science gender found simple claim woman science differently men
As put point ovary testis directly affect science Other feminist science study scholar argue social construction science aim show science science constructed lens culturally socially created gendered
Thus ovary testis culture shape science
Science separate person science culture science embedded Tuana
Although social constructivism prevailing theoretical framework feminist work Donna Haraway cautioned may powerful tool deconstructing science object since may help maintain ideological doctrine science focus rhetoric abandon objectivity
Karen Barad challenge feminist science study take study practice knowing italic original would acknowledge part world differential This echo earlier challenge expressed Rose importance personal within theory need theory integrate interpret lived experience

Having documented challenged woman minority absence science scholar asking specific individual male female leave science aimed improve number minority science Seymour Hewitt
Feminist scholar suggested encouraged several strategy improvement
Modest curricular reform science included education includes peer instruction real world activity active learning learning activity reflect reality science challenging common stereotype science
Second feminist scientist scholar science encouraged education training scientist conduct investigation accordance feminist principle resist androcentric current mainstream research community case organize intellectual production along theoretical line identified feminism Kohlstedt Longino
This influence education training may fastest growing area feminist science study broadly construed scientist begin take feminist concern see example Mayberry et al
Wyer et al

Recently scholar asked feminism changed science begun answer affirmative
See special issue edited Londa Schiebinger especially article physicist Amy Bug archaeologist Margaret Conkey evolutionary biologist Patty Gowaty

The presence woman science feminist critique feminist theory contributed change modern science well study science
But important goal feminist science study encourage presence woman men differ race class nation sexuality disability etc
bring science science study multifaceted awareness difference power relation domination language need innovative methodology
Having documented absence reason absence woman science industrialized nation scholar begun examine role gender science developing nation process development Campion Shrum however analysis gender science culture outside western culture needed
Although race likely addressed within feminist mainstream science study even nascent area study
Scholars addressing race science include Evelynn Hammond Banu Subramaniam Jenny Reardon Alondra Nelson researcher Sandra Harding anthology
Disabilities study also new field promise trouble space science able body feminist theory see Kafer Hall Kittay et al work scholar
Feminist science scholar continue respond Hilary Rose challenge create practice feeling thinking writing opposes abstraction male bourgeois scientific thought Rose
Feminist science study feminist activist research feminist appropriation science often pose challenge conventional view make science scientific
The traditional conception objectivity value neutrality freedom science moral social political value often associated conception objectivity come question
Feminist perspective science sometimes expose instance value compromise scientific result seen
When sexist assumption either directly projectively shape understanding approach object inquiry variety distortion science occur
But feminist science study also reveal instance moral social political value improve science
It follows key task philosopher science operating feminist perspective reframing account evidence justification objectivity show possible value improve science
The following subsection focus approach several feminist philosopher science taken challenge role value science reconceptualizing objectivity
One way feminist philosopher science responded challenge approach might call empiricist Many feminist empiricist influenced American pragmatist second half twentieth century particularly Wilfred Sellars Willard van Orman Quine Donald Davidson
Miriam Solomon note prevalence influence variety contemporary feminist empiricist including
These feminist take naturalized approach philosophy science basing account knowledge practice science focus
They empiricist taking experience ultimate arbitrator belief holists take belief answer experience Quine phrase web belief
Longino contextual empiricism discussed detail elsewhere see entry briefly entry section one influential example approach Longino
We examine several version work Lynn Hankinson Nelson Alison Wylie Elizabeth Anderson Sharyn Clough
Lynn Hankinson Nelson naturalized holistic feminist empiricist account explicitly derived reading Quine title book make clear
For Nelson philosophy naturalized commensurable actual history contemporary practice science grounded science relevant theory theorizing psychology cognitive science biology sociology explains consensus dissent progressive le progressive episode term
Thus good philosophy science must like good science achieve balance among empirical success predictive success explanatory power must good epistemology science describe explain scientific knowledge acquired
Nelson hold naturalized philosophy science justify knowledge general particular knowledge claim instead must give empirically adequate description production scientific knowledge held accountable case study rationally reconstructed fit philosophy science
Its normative job ask whether social process currently characterizing scientific practice recruitment education etc
likely produce best theory suggest change ensure
Feminist naturalized philosophy science attends process including especially methodological process reflecting gender consideration
And since gender never fact separated race class category feminist philosophy science attends also
The actual practice science thus incorporates cultural value way value part interconnected system belief subject empirical constraint
In Nelson empiricist holism hypothesis model theory put forward science must tested relevant evidence evidence includes observational consequence hypothesis large set theory within hypothesis embedded including theory
Thus hypothesis model branch science related many current theory
For Nelson evidence supporting specific theory hypothesis research program two type observation although observation traditional empiricism rather observation already informed background theory body accepted standard theory also differ traditional empiricist account informed social belief value
This account empiricist holist inasmuch state evidence constituted observation theory supported evidence theory
Yet holism relatively modest evidence hypothesis includes observational consequence many current theory metaphysical assumption method standard practice
The account also naturalized Nelson note observation largely structured current theory would meaning observational experience explained scientific account given neurobiology developmental biology neuropsychology evolutionary biology rather philosophical account
Nelson point feminist case study good scientific work show value influence scientific justification
See passim discussion man hunter theory human evolution discussion work neuroendocrinology showing hemispheric lateralization discussion centrality sex difference sociobiology
She concludes case study lack empirical success make scientific work necessarily value
Her holistic view evidence allows u see androcentric assumption made scientist revealed feminist science study baseless rest upon evidence includes commonly held social assumption relation sex
That feminist hold due large part perspective perspective arising shared response current social experience relation tradition historically culturally specific way organizing social life
For Nelson distinction good bad science still based traditional constitutive epistemic virtue including though limited empirical adequacy explanatory power predictive power
Moreover Nelson argues case study also reveal contextual value sometimes help constitute evidence good science science scientist say good science
Thus theory together experience constitute evidence include social value theory
We must say reconsider assumption political belief theory value subject empirical control way judge
Finally basis case study Nelson also argues knowledge produced maintained community
While individual scientist put forward candidate knowledge know hypothesis autonomously relevant community deemed hypothesis confirmed
Among challenge empirical holistic account account science confirmation hypothesis appears circular scientific belief merely confirm one another
Archaeology provides u particularly salient example archaeologist must use analytical theory drawn familiar source make hypothesis past culture lifeways interpret archaeological data evidence test hypothesis
Clearly observation hence observational evidence Given evidence used support hypothesis theory cultural past informed theory based cultural present archaeologist avoid begging question favor understanding past culture
Alison Wylie developed Consilience Model Confirmation analysis many case showing archaeologist fact judge relative credibility evidential explanatory claim
The model compatible form holism Nelson show hypothesis different domain bear interpretation data data function evidence hypothesis hypothesis taken background assumption supporting argument evidence hypothesis test interpretation hypothesis ultimately hypothesis principle different domain affect theory giving rise turn supported hypothesis tested
Questions adequacy interpretive hypothesis usually settled Wylie note independently constituted line evidence converge
Archaeologists recognize evidence stable foundational given always mitigated objectivity achieved theory used data evidence secure independent
Evidence must secure two sens first background knowledge used link present record data antecedent cause condition produced past event must credible home context paleobotanical claim used argument must well established paleobotany second inference supported background knowledge secure degree link present record data antecedent cause past event background assumption unique deterministic degree argument chain relatively short simple
The evidence must also exhibit epistemic independence two sens background assumption used establish evidence must independent hypothesis tested background assumption linking principle set linking principle derived one different source used establish evidential import archaeological data must confirmed independently one another
Background assumption also must horizontally independent one another one set linking principle entail others proper subset confirmed evidence
Once evidence secure independent archaeologist triangulate set system mutual constraint among different line evidence bearing hypothesis ultimately theory
Wylie model show archaeologist use enormous diversity evidence diversity ensures evidence sometimes function constraint claim cultural past particularly depends background knowledge one different source enters interpretation different point
Thus different line evidence mutually constraining converge fail converge coherent account particular past context
Wylie model provides good analysis gender consideration enter archaeological reasoning allows u see evidential consideration meet standard good practice field
For example current assumption woman gender role uncritically taken used support hypothesis cultural past particular context linking hypothesis past woman gender role fail present assumption often fail fully
A number feminist case study archaeology reveal instance conventional work fails requirement collateral theory independent
For example Patty Jo Watson Mary Kennedy reveal pervasive androcentrism explanation emergence agriculture Eastern Woodlands Christine Hastorf study site central Andes show gender role household structure everywhere time change societal structure dominant idea change Elizabeth Brumfiel whose work Valley Mexico show Aztec state depended tribute maintain political economic hegemony depended change organization deployment predominantly female domestic labor
Arguably greatest challenge feminist science scholar showing feminist value result epistemically better science
Critics argue feminist hold value dogmatically
Indeed critic argue everyone hold value dogmatically value influenced fact
Moreover critic claim social value interest influence scientific work supplant reasoning evidence interfere goal science finding truth nature human human life finding theory good fit fit data reasonably well
Thus social value interest influence scientific work make bad science
Since many feminist argue feminist value able improve science challenge must respond
One way would make distinction legitimate illegitimate us value
This approach Elizabeth Anderson take
As illustration use value legitimate way Anderson offer analysis Abigail Stewart et al
research divorce Anderson explicitly guided feminist value variety way
According Anderson value Stewart team researcher brought investigation sort answerable empirical evidence emotional state
Anderson argues value subject critical scrutiny revision light argument evidence briefly experience disillusionment allow people dogmatic learn experience value mistaken
Like experience emotional experience cognitive usually representative content find representative content erroneous confused etc
Thus find cognitive content emotional experience defective way might discount importance feeling
Such emotional experience function evidence value experience independent desire end
We persuaded reason fact despite emotional experience something someone thing person valuable
This sort persuasive argument quite common make sense emotion responsive fact
And usually emotion reliable though certainly infallible evidence value judgment
The exception include emotion affected drug depression etc

Anderson examines background value function various stage Stewart et al
research framing research question understanding object inquiry making decision data collect generation sampling data analysis data including choice technique analysis decision end data analysis conclusion drawn
To illustrate focus one way value enter understanding object inquiry
In case divorce study variety object need considered prominent among divorce Stewart research team acknowledges object inquiry thickly value concept part description
Anderson note example value incorporated concept divorce used Stewart team differ incorporated Judith Wallerstein Joan research divorce Wallerstein Kelly
For Wallerstein Kelly divorce conceived loss trauma
Stewart team contrast took divorce process adjustment new state
There two important difference alternative conception divorce
The first divorce treated event aftermath rather ongoing life adjustment
Second process adjustment allowing positive negative effect
Wallerstein framing divorce trauma loss call researcher focus negative effect shape data collection
analysis make clear study incorporate one
However Stewart et al value explicitly present thus open empirical scrutiny
Anderson argument Stewart et al
divorce study better science previous research divorce empirically adequate thus argument consistent evaluation standard increased empirical adequacy prima facie better account
However differs analysis value invoked study responsiveness empirical evidence
conception object inquiry allows negative positive experience count evidence effect divorce way team conceptualizes object inquiry allows consideration evidence unlike Wallerstein Kelly research focus negative effect
Thus Anderson analysis research indicates feminist value held researcher incorporated research produce empirically adequate hence better science
Sharyn Clough approach question value science develops view based Donald Davidson account belief extension Quinean holism
For Clough holism requires value empirically political claim feminist claim better supported empirical evidence others
She made use account examine sexist racist value evidence hence science sexist racist clearly good science Clough Clough Loges
She also examined feminist value improve research
One recent example analysis research hygiene hypothesis increased level concern sanitation consequent decrease exposure pathogen related increasingly high rate disease allergy particularly industrialized nation North West Clough
The primary evidence hypothesis correlation rate disease hygiene habit area rate increased
Further support hypothesis garnered recent research show increased exposure microbe childhood correlated increased immunity adulthood
Clough explores case feminist perspective noting additional affected population suffering illness disproportionate representation woman girl
Clough argues viewed awareness gender structure human society generally require higher standard cleanliness female child male greater incidence morbidity among female becomes evidence hygiene hypothesis thus provides opportunity increased empirical adequacy
In word paying attention using minimum feminist value gender range data researcher treat evidence
Thus value potential increase empirical adequacy account
In effect feminist value give rise augmented hygiene hypothesis take account differential enforcement standard cleanliness predicts decreased immunity adult female
On Clough analysis feminist value drive research first foremost belief semantic content formed differently content factual belief
Together belief form holistic web meaning use Quinean metaphor
Factual value judgment might used different rhetorical purpose explanation research different saying one kind judgment empirical content Clough
These two example provide illustration case study analysis may used work role value serve good science general sort insight holist account provide made specific
Each account discussed requires political social moral cultural value sort traditionally understood must answer empirical evidence
While differ philosophical detail exactly evidence bear theory account strong similarity suggest avenue reconciliation even convergence
But holist account present challenge regard
Solomon expressed concern ability feminist holist empiricism provide general analysis value function knowledge production
She question whether single approach value able provide account various way value may function science
She argues value one type consequently relevant may always relevant according Solomon may relevant different way playing different role knowledge production
Different discussed way thinking contextual value better understanding various role value play knowledge production Solomon
Miriam Solomon critique ongoing discussion highlight another aspect diversity feminist perspective science
One reason many philosopher science found difficult accept conclusion feminist value make positive contribution science commitment ideal scientific objectivity
Elisabeth Lloyd note meaning objectivity objective complex unstable far clear
In one philosophical picture objective characterizes relationship knower methodologically knower must detached investment particular belief attachment point view bias could impede free acquisition knowledge correct representation independent
In Lloyd analysis problem lie claim objective reality refers Really Real converged upon application objective The Really Real known since publicly accessible use objective method properly detached disinterested
As Lloyd point view assumes Really Real completely independent u thus b objective knowledge Reality requires objective method characterized detachment c attachment point view might interfere independence reality wish know reality publicly accessible accessible
These assumption problematic next section consider affect feminist philosophy science
The first assumption Really Real completely independent u fails acknowledge addition resistance reality sociocultural factor necessarily involved development knowledge Anthropologists virtually unanimous holding sex gender role lay foundation every human society social practice therefore epistemology philosophy science includes social interest value integral acquisition knowledge include sex gender related value interest Lloyd
Lloyd elaborates researcher investigate phenomenon goal represent reality give representation relevant
Scientific account theory hypothesis must focus part reality relevant interest value give rise research question motivate research
While reality may independent u account reality account aspect reality matter u shaped interest give rise research program
Additionally question addressed research arise part thought known time research commences mean part evidence account rest background knowledge
The ineliminability value background knowledge current project challenge traditional idea objectivity
In addressing question objectivity Lloyd Anderson make use Hugh Lacey distinction two aspect ideal neutrality impartiality clarify interest value may implicated good science Lacey
Neutrality requirement scientific theory neither presuppose support moral political social cultural value
Impartiality requirement theory must evaluated basis evidence extent fulfill epistemic value
Anderson cite Kuhn list empirical adequacy consistency scope external consonance established theory Anderson
Impartiality achieved disregarding evaluative value instead achieved commitment pas judgment relation set evaluative standard transcends competing interest advocate rival answer question Anderson
Thus Lloyd Anderson take impartiality key feature objectivity Lacey rock bottom component idea science value free Lacey
However discussed section Anderson note least value judgment answer empirical evidence may serve part evidence background theory evaluate evidence hypothesis consideration
This realization force reassessment ideal theory may affect assessment evidence must prepared determine influence pernicious beneficial
As seen section Anderson make distinction examining extent value responsive extent held
In order meet ideal impartiality researcher must consider evidence either support value direct research question impartial science need neutral
This discussion focused approach fall general description empiricist many owe much Longino contextual empiricism see entry close brief description feature contextual empiricism bear question objectivity
Using Kuhnian argument underdetermination theory evidence Longino argues since empirical evidence never fully determine accept particular theory contextual value social moral political cultural must play role determination
Therefore evidence relative contextual value evaluation theory occurs view shared among philosopher discussed
As result scientific theory neutral presupposes certain social political value among background assumption theory evaluated hence objective traditional sense requires neutrality
For Longino scientific theory impartial either since social political value play role theory acceptance
Longino offer another understanding objectivity grows social character science provides opportunity transformative Such criticism requires adherence social norm publicly recognized forum criticism evidence method assumption reasoning uptake criticism requires community merely tolerate dissent alter belief theory time response critical discourse publicly recognized standard reference theory hypothesis observational practice evaluated appeal criticism made relevant goal inquiring community finally community must characterized tempered equality intellectual authority Longino
When science conducted according norm balance partiality Longino considers objective degree fulfills norm
But neither neutral impartial since scientific theory informed value shape context relevance evidence determined
Feminist standpoint theory often contrasted feminist empiricism alternative epistemology addressing concern role value question objectivity
We briefly discus several different analysis feminist standpoint theory next section
While standard distinguish feminist empiricism feminist standpoint theory since Harding categorization feminist alternative traditional epistemology three empiricism feminist standpoint theory feminist shall see recent analysis feminist standpoint theory refinement feminist empiricism suggest view compatible may converge Intemann
Philosophical account feminist standpoint theory begin Sandra Harding account methodology sociologist Dorothy Smith used advocated Smith Harding
While various version commonality include endorsement following three thesis situated knowledge thesis thesis epistemic privilege achievement thesis Wylie Rolin Intemann Crasnow
The thesis situated knowledge based understanding knowledge particular set socially situated knower always location characterized power relation endemic setting
The differential distribution power difference interest closely thus question asked feature world relevant answering question vary depending location well
As Smith put From point view woman place value assigned different aspect world changed
Among difference salient conflict interest dominant group
Thus metaphor situated knowledge social location give rise one key idea feminist standpoint idea researcher double Patricia Hill Collins example advocate use standpoint analyze race class
She argues researcher marginalized may recognize many concept procedure adopted discipline problematic colleague precisely able see object inquiry eye researcher trained discipline experience marginalized social location
Epistemic privilege one contentious component feminist standpoint theory
Much criticism view stem mistaken understanding epistemic privilege thought automatic
As Kristen Intemann point claim feminist standpoint theory made view would either trivial false Intemann
But feminist standpoint theory committed clearly false claim woman know experience woman
Nor make trivial claim particular experience know experience like
This seemingly trivial claim suffers another problem case since idea woman know experience woman depends presupposition woman presupposition blatantly false
A understanding social location reveals flaw presupposition since many difference among woman social cultural political location
Misunderstandings situated knowledge epistemic advantage thesis result thinking isolation mistakenly taking claim individualistic knowledge
Feminist standpoint theory account individual acquires knowledge rather account treat knowledge social
This point made clearly considering achievement thesis
Understanding achievement thesis requires distinguishing standpoint perspective
Harding following way
Feminist standpoint theory intends map practice way dominant institution conceptual framework create maintain oppressive social relation structure
It uncovering distinctive insight hierarchical social structure work
This come creation group consciousness rather shift perspective individual Harding
While change location individual automatically brings different perspective achievement standpoint automatic
Perspective necessarily include awareness one would need map practice power understand form oppression
Perspective also right metaphor understanding way group consciousness created differs individual
Harding emphasizes deeply political aspect feminist standpoint theory
This characterization also make clear challenge feminist standpoint theory raise objectivity
Both neutrality impartiality seem violated feminist standpoint theory
Using analysis previous section see thesis knowledge situated mean partial
Treating epistemic privilege virtue rather vice depends partiality knowledge
And finally view privilege merely result social location prescribes striving partiality rather impartiality
It surprising resistance feminist standpoint theory revolved around way perceived threat objectivity science Pinnick
Harding address concern objectivity call strong objectivity see also section
Strong objectivity mean subject knowledge process knowledge produced scrutinized according standard object knowledge
The contextual element function part evidence selection problem formation hypothesis design research including organization research community collection interpretation sorting data decision stop research way result research reported need open critical evaluation
But evaluation requires contextual element visible researcher
The feminist standpoint theory produce give rise epistemic advantage researcher access information
A maximally critical study scientist community done perspective whose life marginalized community
Thus strong objectivity requires scientist community integrated project scientific epistemological reason well moral political one Harding
Alison Wylie offer alternative approach question objectivity account feminist standpoint theory suggests blurring line feminist empiricism feminist standpoint theory
She note objectivity frequently used indicate relationship theory world identified property knowledge claim
She proposes think objectivity degree claim conform standard set epistemic virtue empirical adequacy explanatory power internal coherence consistency established body knowledge
These theoretical virtue rarely ever maximized virtue deemed important given time depend interest purpose intention goal might element standpoint
Consequently feminist standpoint improve objectivity determining sort empirical adequacy explanatory power virtue relevant particular knowledge project degree relevant
Empirical adequacy typically thought crucial theory must fit consequently might thought empirical adequacy always preferred virtue
But Wylie point empirical adequacy ambiguous
It could either fidelity rich body localized evidence empirical depth capacity travel Haraway claim question extended range domain application empirical breadth Wylie even case empirical adequacy interest standpoint relevant
On Wylie account science neutral value inform hypothesis implied impartial given value determine among characteristic determine objectivity considered relevant knowledge project
But impartiality entirely vanished count empirical determined value although relevance
The epistemic privilege thesis feminist standpoint theory show position subordination epistemic privilege regarding kind evidence relevance special inferential heuristic interpretative explanatory hypothesis
Wylie thus affirms thesis epistemic privilege although note epistemic privilege contingent
It always relative specific knowledge project
Both Harding Wylie appeal standard epistemic value transcend value yet account accommodate value provide way understanding value play positive role knowledge production
Intemman argued contemporary feminist empiricism feminist standpoint theory converged many way
For example Wylie account feminist standpoint theory compatible holism discussed
However Intemann identifies two remaining area difference feminist empiricism feminist standpoint theory differ kind diversity needed objectivity differ role value play enhancing objectivity Intemann
She contends feminist empiricism would benefit adopting feminist standpoint understanding diversity social location rather diversity interest value contribute objectivity
Intemann argues feminist standpoint theory offer better explanation positive role feminist value science rather simply advocating diversity value feminist empiricism
Whereas feminist empiricism argues balancing value diversity embrace impartiality Intemann claim feminist standpoint theory extols feminist value value rather role improving impartiality
She suggests convergent position dub feminist standpoint empiricism
Gaile Pohlhaus suggested distinctive feature feminist standpoint theory fully developed
She criticizes Harding explication feminist standpoint theory individualist identifying spatial metaphor social location source problem
The location metaphor effect individualizing one individual occupy place time
Pohlhaus argues feminist standpoint theory requires social conception knower knower conceived knowledge community individual
Such social conception knower also provides path conception knower structured distribution power provides fuller account achievement thesis
Standpoint understood achieved primarily struggling dominant understanding world
What missing account struggling
To would involve building relation others may come know world understand one another project building knowing community Pohlhaus
Political community built shared interest
Building community requires acknowledging diversity interest arise diversity uncovering shared interest forge community
The political nature early standpoint root Marxist theory captured political feature achievement later version minimize moving away Marxist use class struggle primary organizing principle analysis
Sharon Crasnow suggests Pohlhaus insight developed nuanced account value negotiated shared interest
These negotiated forged shared interest arrived could serve provisionally stabilize evidential relevance relation around particular knowledge project
Such extension feminist standpoint theory may also point relationship current research social epistemology see entry
This another path convergence feminist empiricism standpoint theory could developed
Feminist perspective science reflect broad spectrum appraisal epistemic attitude toward science
These motivated recognition institution science traditionally excluded woman practitioner issue concern woman minority routinely marginalized scientific inquiry treated way reproduce stereotype scientific authority often rationalizes social role institution feminist call question
Feminists skeptical presumption science inherently masculine woman unfit science science unfit conviction institution science model meritocracy
This skepticism led feminist equity critique discussed section
Feminist historian science document entrenched historical pattern exclusion woman time recover evidence woman active participation science
Although century woman admitted institution higher education slowly gained access scientific training since become clear gain science training translated comparable improvement representation faculty science leadership position science
Conventional explanation persistent inequality typically invoke talent drive preference woman
But explanation note intentional discrimination still exists gender discrimination also take form diffuse persistent difference recognition reward achievement
These difference treatment arise part cognitive schema heuristic operate threshold conscious awareness generating pattern evaluation bias track gender also range marker social inequality constituted
Although feminist different perspective science work feminist share concern understand change condition oppression operate along line gender difference
These goal require accurate understanding nature source oppression science offer powerful tool providing understanding
As saw Section feminist scientist call attention neglected question aim improving science term methodologically epistemically conservative challenge background assumption methodological commitment standard practice existing program scientific research
We think approach selective appropriation tool scientific inquiry application research
But even epistemically conservative feminist focused correcting error omission investigating neglected generate deeply challenging question
Thus many feminist scientist critical standard practice existing research program pursue constructive program aimed transforming methodology ontological commitment framework assumption epistemic ideal animate field
As see many example presented Section intervention intend remedial corrective often expose pattern omission distortion compromise detail framework assumption science examined epistemic ideal inform scientific practice
The recognition established scientific methodology frequently reproduce generate androcentric sexist bias led feminist ask improve method
Feminists articulated guideline research sought avoid pitfall sexist androcentric practice exposed feminist critique Section
These guideline include addressing question relevant woman others oppressed gendered system grounding research situated experience woman ensuring woman experience give rise directly question asked undertaking treat gendered experience critical resource stage research though epistemically foundational adhering ethical pragmatic norm specifying practitioner accountable research subject various sens reflexive
Strong reflexivity mean taking account way socially defined angle vision interest value influence research process
In short feminist research aim prevent gender All issue discussed essay equity critique philosophical analysis among included field known feminist science Generally interdisciplinary field discussed Section encompasses feminist work anthropology cultural study economics feminism history philosophy political science sociology aim show science social activity
Across discipline feminist science scholar contribute gender analysis address issue power inequality difference among knower subjectivity objectivity embodiment work distinction scientific expert
And feminist analysis pay attention relationship among science gender race class sexuality disability colonialism science construct applies difference
Section briefly summarizes past work feminist science study note recent work increasingly turn role gender science developing nation process development intersection gender science culture outside western culture hold promise
Although race likely addressed within feminist mainstream science study much work remains done finally feminist disability study appear increasing prominence
Feminist science study often expose instance gendered social value compromise scientific result
But often feminist science study reveal value improve science
This recognition fly face traditional philosophical view value come matter theory justification evidence objectivity
Thus feminist philosophy science exemplified Section undertake determine whether social value interest play positive role scientific knowledge production
Science conventionally understood objective sense scientific work result work free value moral social political value
Feminist philosopher science offered alternative account objectivity order explain science incorporates feminist value better objective science
They aim giving account empirically adequate case study stand without excessive rational reconstruction
This focus case study also call alternative analysis objectivity understood
We reviewed variety alternative approach use feminist empiricism feminist standpoint theory
In summary feminist perspective science arise concern improve life affected gender inequity encouraging using better understanding natural social world

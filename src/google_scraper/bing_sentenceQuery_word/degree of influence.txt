In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

A bachelor degree computer science provides student much comprehensive education
Probably one important difference associate bachelor degree computer science especially recent graduate type job salary level provide
It probably go without saying earning bachelor degree computer science qualifies student better position associate degree
An associate degree computer science typically requires student complete semester hour bachelor degree computer science usually requires semester hour
Both associate bachelor degree similar general education requirement bachelor degree substantially major course requirement provide study computer science associate degree
The Bachelor Computer Science typically take four year complete today several accelerated program student earn degree three year
While student option earning associate degree computer science Bachelor Computer Science degree choice among employer recruiter looking fill coveted information technology position
The Bachelor Computer Science bachelor computer science degree offered college university
There several bachelor degree computer science program core curriculum Bachelor Computer Science
Other comparable degree include Following trend established field study many university offer degree awarded student exhibit superior academic performance complete additional year study
Not bachelor degree program
Truth known uncommon curriculum coursework vary one school degree
Students carefully review consider computer science program make sure help meet educational career goal
Some common topic addressed bachelor degree computer science program include Algorithms Programming Paradigms Data Structures Information Retrieval Programming Principles Computer Architecture Logic Computation
More course usually associated specialized discipline computer science include interaction information theory data communication theory computation numerical computation operating system compiler computer graphic game design information assurance distributed system artificial intelligence among others

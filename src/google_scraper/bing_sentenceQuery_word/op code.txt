In abbreviated also known portion specifies operation performed
Beside opcode instruction also specify data process form
In addition opcodes used various hardware device also used part specification
Specifications format opcodes laid instruction set architecture processor question may general specialized processing unit
Apart opcode instruction normally also one specifier
data operation act although operation may operand none
There instruction set nearly uniform field opcode operand specifier well others architecture instance complicated structure
Depending architecture may value value value port specified accessed using le complex
The type include data copying program control well special instruction others
us instruction operand represent
This enhances readability still giving precise control machine instruction
Most programming currently done using typically easier read write
These language need compiled translated assembly language run compiled program
Opcodes also found representation intended software interpreter rather hardware device
These instruction set often employ slightly data type operation hardware counterpart nevertheless constructed along similar line
Examples include byte code found interpreted JVM byte code used compiled code CIL many others

All computer software built set instruction
Instructions encoded binary
The cycle sequence step CPU follows process instruction
decoded set sequenced operation
These operation instruct inside
The opcode tell processor job need done
A simple operation might
If use analogy recipe opcode might
Each opcode instruction limited tell processor
A CPU contains opcodes accept
There two type opcode The operand specifies data need acted
The operand also refer place memory
If use analogy recipe ingredient eg onion thing acted upon opcode
So opcode could act operand
If operand refers place memory could seen board
The operand data could memory location board
The instruction could chop onion chopping board

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Are tutorial YouTube good text tutorial designing expanding opcodes
I always make mistake switching one line another counting binary
I pretty much know design I really understand I make many mistake
I also example go check answer
Here one example kind designing exercise I need Design instruction instr instr instr
The address bit bit instruction style xx yy zz So I went designing like last one I guess correct
Maybe tutorial YouTube someone simplify explain text
It look like simply problem mapping set possible value possible instruction bit encoding
You specified whether instruction encoding need length
If different length usually want form encoded value prefix
If instruction encoding must length mapping give different instruction different encoding acceptable
Your solution look OK
prefix address
Editorial comment exercise bit boring trivial involve much way deep concept
It matter
When designing opcode equivalent
In case opcodes known independent identically distributed probability Huffman coding give optimal prefix code
As DW point need
A code opcode prefix opcode
Prefix code equivalent binary tree leaf tree opcode
So take tree correct number leaf label leaf operation opcode operation path root leaf
Where going left path going right path
If know probability operation encoding create Huffman tree keeping node priority probability node
You start queue filled leaf operation probability
On iteration pull two lowest priority node create parent make two node child parent give parent probability sum child
Then insert parent back priority queue repeat one node left
Alternatively know probability trying design encoding operation many operand shorter opcodes operation fewer operand longer opcodes trying design unbalanced tree specific number leaf level
Start operation need fewest operand build upwards
In example know need operation zero operand start creating balanced tree leaf intermediate node one root
Now need operation one operand plus operation zero operand build balanced tree leaf attach zero operand tree one leaf label leaf operation
Next need operation
Just repeat process tree building bottom eventually finished
Then read opcodes operation following path root leaf corresponding operation

I quite new
I tried understand difference mentioned term clear fashion however I still confused
Here I found In computer assembler assembly language mnemonic abbreviation operation
It entered operation code field assembler program instruction
example mean register
mnemonic
They get translated assembler
Instructions statement assembly language generally simple unlike programming language
Generally mnemonic symbolic name single executable machine language instruction opcode least one opcode mnemonic defined machine language instruction
Each instruction typically consists operation opcode plus zero operand
This question came site information security professional
It number interpreted machine virtual silicon represents operation perform Same machine code except mostly used software based interpreter like Java CLR English word MNEMONIC mean A device pattern letter idea association assist remembering something
So usually used assembly language programmer remember OPERATIONS machine like ADD MUL MOV etc
This assembler specific
It sequence number flip switch computer perform certain job work addition number branching multiplication etc etc
This purely machine specific well documented implementers processor
There two assembly one assembly program sequence mnemonic operand fed assembler assembles mnemonic operand executable machine code
Optionally linker link assembly produce executable file
second assembly CLR based language language sequence CLR code infused metadata information sort library executable code directly executable
Aniket good job I go
First understand lowest level computer program data number sometimes called memory kind
Most commonly word multiple bit necessarily processor word considerably larger
Regardless though number represented series like
What number mean reading processor case read memory one word time based number instruction see take action
Such action might example reading value memory writing value memory modifying value read jumping somewhere else memory read instruction
In early day programmer would literally flick switch make change memory light read keyboard screen
As time progressed memory got larger processor became complex display device keyboard input conceived easier way program
Paraphrasing Aniket The OPCODE part instruction word interpreted processor representing operation perform read write jump add
Many instruction also OPERANDS affect instruction performs saying memory read write jump
So instruction bit size example processor may use bit opcode bit two operand
A step toggling switch code might entered machine using program called monitor
The programmer would use simple command say memory want modify enter MACHINE CODE numerically
base hex using A F digit
Though better toggling switch entering machine code still slow error prone
A step ASSEMBLY CODE us easily remembered MNEMONICS place actual number represents instruction
The job ASSEMBLER primarily transform mnemonic form program corresponding machine code
This make programming easier particularly jump instruction part instruction memory address jump number word skip
Programming machine code requires painstaking calculation formulate correct instruction code added removed jump instruction may need recalculated
The assembler handle programmer
This leaf BYTECODE fundamentally machine code describes low level operation reading writing memory basic calculation
Bytecode typically conceived produced COMPILING higher level language example PHP Java unlike machine code many hardware based processor may operation support specific feature higher level language
A key difference processor bytecode usually program though processor created interpreting bytecode specification
processor called SOAR Smalltalk On A RISC Smalltalk bytecode
While would typically call native machine code bytecode type processor CISC EISC
Linn Rekursiv people made record player processor contains program interpreting machine instruction parallel
The following line disassembled code

With following byte represents language
PUSH instruction push byte bit length data stack
The word PUSH represents opcode
Each byte
real machine CPUs pseudo machine code virtual machine
When write java code
java compiler compiles code generates byte code
A file execute code platform without changing
Assembly originates early code assembler would assemble program multiple file would call include file
Though note file often card deck
The use term assembly language refer mnemonic representation code assembler somewhat imprecise since number assembler support include file hence assemble
It interesting note assembler invented support subroutine
Originally internal external subroutine
Internal subroutine would call inline whereas external one reached via primitive call mechanism
There much controversy time whether external subroutine good idea
Mnemonic come name Greek god Mnemosyne goddess memory
Anything help remember stuff mnemonic device
Recently I read good article thus like share whoever good explanation topic

Opcode short operation code
As name suggests opcode type code tell machine
operation perform
Opcode type machine language instruction
similar nature also tell machine
However designed executed processor rather
It commonly used software based interpreter like
They convert machine instruction machine instruction instruction computer processor understand
In fact name come

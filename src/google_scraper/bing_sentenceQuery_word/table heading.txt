Not confused typically row top table help identify row header
For example table three column Name Date Birth Phone header
When table created Microsoft Excel top row allows table data sorted design table different data
In picture right header row Part Low Price High Price cell top table
Clicking arrow allows sort column
In example Low Price column sorted highest lowest
Like header row Excel header row Microsoft Word top row table Microsoft Word


A arrangement row column possibly complex structure
Tables widely used
Tables appear print medium handwritten note computer software architectural ornamentation traffic sign many place
The precise convention terminology describing table vary depending context
Further table differ significantly variety structure flexibility notation representation use
In book technical article table typically presented apart main text numbered captioned
A table consists ordered arrangement
This simplified description basic kind table
Certain consideration follow simplified description The element table may grouped segmented arranged many different way even nested
Additionally table may include header ancillary feature
The following illustrates simple table three column seven row
The first row counted used display column name
This called header row
The concept also part basic terminology
Any simple table represented table data value ordered
A common example table
In table cell body table value cell relates value beginning column
header row structure complex table
This combination value header row row lack better term header column column lack better term related unique cell table Tables described wide narrow format
As communication tool table allows form information unlimited number different social scientific context
It provides familiar way convey information might otherwise obvious readily understood
For example following diagram two alternate representation information presented side side
On left NFPA standard example value indicated right simple table displaying value along additional information
Both representation convey essentially information tabular representation arguably comprehensible someone familiar NFPA standard
The tabular representation may however ideal every circumstance example space limitation safety reason
There several specific situation table routinely used matter custom formal convention
Modern software application give user ability generate format edit table tabular data wide variety us example Tables us software development specification implementation
Usage software specification encompass ad hoc inclusion simple textual document use tabular specification methodology example include SCR Statestep
Proponents tabular technique among prominent emphasize understandability well quality cost advantage format allowing systematic inspection corresponding shortcoming experienced graphical notation cited motivating development least two tabular approach
At programming level software may implemented using construct generally represented understood tabular whether store data perhaps earlier result example determining flow program execution response various event input
Database system often store data structure called table column data field row represent data record
In medieval covered piece cloth count money
archaic term English institution accounted money owed
Thus table stack coin concrete realization

submitted I dabbled bit python java I also done little bit web stuff php javascript html cs
Right seems like everything heading web even software
I enjoy web software development I want stick one
In future next year think computer science best job future
Post comment
The job exactly exactly ten year ago exactly year ago software development includes web development software end day
What going change specific career demand industry application field
Yesterday writing desktop apps productivity today writing native mobile apps social interaction tomorrow writing apps new platform use
But really going change
Web development IS software development
Most large enterprise application web convenient complexity lie
And software
These day lot stuff really complex given really amazing website
Is complex written language though
Depends lot enterprise stuff I worked back end either C VB language pretty much writing desktop stuff
I think right saying lot application moving web still area mainly focussed desktop apps like die skill area would become useless
When I asked boss include knowledge software engineering best practice something like job description web developer said make software though
We make web apps
Software like desktop apps
I spent two hour convincing otherwise
Define language
Do confuse language building
In sufficiently large system right industry complex likely component running mainframe accessing created year ago
Languages general generic
A lot back end written Java example language specifically created web development
deleted That sound like nightmare maintain long term
Do really think increased flexibility worth possibly ending module one company understands well
That sound awesome
I never knew could use language like Java Python back end
The really common Web Development backend language I think PHP
Obviously node server asking
I work Web related dev day
I would wager serious apps move online made online much le likely see PHP
I would wager serious apps move online made online much le likely see PHP
Facebook us PHP
Also PHP may started web language use pushing byte web browser via HTTP
The crawler written PHP web interface ran service
Until Marco switched Go performance scalability reason
Facebook us PHP
That nice php php really point
Most project planned engineer anticipation becoming large scale app going written PHP
FB planned kid college nil engineering experience
Or put another way many people think FB PHP good idea please raise hand
Until Marco switched Go performance scalability reason Exactly
Yes PHP used web headed
Now afaik PHP working towards making case overcome many see PHP
The key part quoted serious apps much le likely see PHP
Not saying wo see plenty PHP I still wager serious web apps often going PHP many still employed
Any funny observation The likelihood PHP used strongly company quality
Sometimes
For project work write backend Java user Angular JS framework front end
big data
analytics done stuff like Java
grows background support frontend growth web backend easy rail node frontend language move backend like node stuff much complex hitting database
want correlate rank everything got come streaming need something
Web frontend
You ca move everything frontend
The web development specific language I think PHP
Other every language generic programming language whatever program
Web development specific application language
When I used VB
I struggled much cause I suck OOP I pretty good design stuff
Is web development software development though
Absolutely
Why would
I know
What make website software
I ca grasp part
I talking website design content front end stuff
web development usually mean HTML JavaScript CSS definitely software
I never heard anyone describe design content web development
Not according Yes
I think AI robotics system design big field future
As people get mobile device attention removed reduced task daily life like driving
We need Computer Scientists Engineers figure solution automate thing people longer want pay attention focus mobile device
focus mobile device
hopefully thing benefit mankind way
Swiping right
deleted Who need steam engine
People stop lazy
The industrial revolution lazy path
deleted I meant cell phone crap What argument cell phone
I going bother asking crap begging move goalpost
Machine learning neural network seem huge day
Kramer say BUY MORE ML AND NUERAL NETWORKS
Web ops I steering towards network engineering
Self modifying code
Driven industry automated vehicle operation automated appliance home system like Nest automated cloud management system data backup high availability logic keep system online shift load around would also apply municipality company preference based service user provide thing relevant
Code able learn adjust accordingly wave I see coming
Gone day software built tested packaged sold going always development role constantly updated video game already
As specific case focus le language industry learning different aspect tool available job
Do learn basic code learn database function learn network function get overall picture start focus part interest let interest drive direction
A general contractor learn hammer knowledge awareness large range topic may specialize one two thing hire folk others know need know skill thing
Schools starting lot cool shit I wish I high school like comp sci class school robotics Assembler coding Raspberry Pi coursework etc
I keyboarding
Yippee
I going disagree initial assertion agree rest say
Self modifying code likely never mainstream
There huge push determinism functional language big part le self modifying code limit
Now agree lot rest people AI huge field still infancy
Massively parallel GPU cluster code another big growth sector
probably poor choice wording
It
Nest good schedule adjusts time
Google car sense shit public driving trying adjust time
That sort thing
That deep learning neural network technology
Very different creature self modifying code Stronger AI robotics machine learning Skynet
deleted Agree functional programming much important introduction lambda java OOP procedural programming IMO still remain important programming principle understand today
Can explain believe functional programming dominant future
Is reason trend notice
I curious know Thanks info
So I looked around little bit seems people learn Haskell write better code language
Is reason recommended
There real distinction software web software elsewhere I necessarily understand desire stick one I would guess web stuff continue growing rapidly next decade
If plan getting PhD AI good field get
If general software engineer still demand
Most major company hiring software engineer company Google Facebook Amazon etc
Programming VR Wearables Data Science already big get bigger
Web Mobile development keep trending upward well
The thing I say sure whatever developing year connected internet
Does HTTP HTML anymore hopefully JS long gone infrastructure going anywhere
I coding JS decade half
I think going away
It actually used much back growing
The highest paying job Computer Science graduate strong math skill
These job work AI ML command highest salary IT
The area I would stay away System Admin
The ratio system per admin drastically increase cloud
Machine Learning already becoming saturated
You need PhD make slightly make bachelor area field
Every job fair I I swarmed people asking ML job
Meanwhile web dev job pay almost nobody want talk
It remnant time web dev considered real programming back HTML CSS little bit PHP sprinkled
ML saturated people work definitely enough people enough fill demand
I swamped people Masters PhDs machine learning place like Georgia Tech Michigan MIT every career fair I attend
I say pretty qualified
To answer question industry basically web development mobile development
Those job remaining firmware desktop application development mainframe embedded engineering shrinking virtually extinct
The college teaching introductory programming Java SQL database course maybe algorithm design pattern thrown academia woefully equipped respond industry constantly changing framework language
Academia simply respond fast enough industry
While true college good enough teach web development curriculum teach HTML CSS JavaScript along Java C basically graduate look forward working
Let give example
The following people relegated working instead true development
They real people obviously I going reveal name Reddit policy
thing correctly went school majored real computer science
His curriculum included Despite impressive qualification depth breadth education notice missing vital education web development specific technology
He took course archaic legacy language seldom used web development although may used automotive firmware engineering example
So recruiter hiring manager give time day end GPA matter grade matter school mean jack internship experience count real experience Person A relegated working Manual QA Tester year even get use crap learned school
A community college dropout formal training computer science
Works purely manual QA tester
Ca automation
Ca even execute SQL query hand held
Gained experience QA working game testing company later moved onto real QA job
Ends boat Person A except le student loan
Salary still range
year
Lazy unmotivated bastard ca even bothered finish community college
The industry still reward simply experience QA
Is offensive people suffered year attain degree
deleted In opinion usefulness college degree simply piece paper recruiter hiring manager check box yup college degree
Otherwise may engage discrimination refuse look resume consider position piece paper degree could used justification pay le
Which mean degree still practically useful
You technically correct It depends whether approach CS trade science
Both example got QA tester job lack web dev education lacked motivation pursue project learning language outside class
Computer Science strictly vocational field
So many people answered would recommend learning one language used learning web technology
Ruby Rails good place start
Thanks post
Before post I could definitely see like Person A
While school I recommend learning HTML CSS JavaScript
This set foundation front end development
Of course practice SQL
Oracle free
Next get free MSDN license free Microsoft Software school I recommend obtain Visual Studio learn C MVC pattern
This efficient path opinion give solid technical background front end back end
Even end working Java Web Services back end development since C Java similar able quickly easily adapt Java
Having background translated JSP Groovy etc
It like smoothly transitioning C Java instead relearn whole new paradigm shift scratch
Of course thing time study Ruby Rails benefit
Some job market research may encouraged part determine whether invest stay away esoteric declining language like PHP Python
If I school I would I seen true nature industry year working enterprise web development
I wish I knew thing year ago I might able get job real developer instead relegated pigeonholed QA rest career I comfortable money come home work tired study thing I would need order transition development I would consider challenging engaging meaningful thus rewarding
So see I actually trying help
I quite unpopular downvoted board raw cynism beaten rigid structure system real world often shocking idealistic young people mesh probably seen experienced shit I
Person A Person B get job industry standard sympathize achievement lack thereof
To people degree please get Degree entitle job notion mind
Skills relevant one get job
Not mere fact degree QA job
Person A easily look variety job utilizing skill
I dont know jackshit web dev I job I know plenty others
The problem Person A world also want jump bandwagon big web dev whatever hot right
My professor use call Chasing ambulance
Not want jump latest thing feel entitled simply everyone else

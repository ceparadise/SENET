Venn diagram going nickname primary diagram set diagram logic diagram widely known
This kind diagram show possible logical relation finite collection different set
These diagram depict element point plane well set region inside closed curve
A Venn diagram consists multiple overlapping closed curve usually represented circle represents set
The point inside curve labeled S represent element set S point outside boundary represent element set S
In Venn diagram curve overlapped different way showing possible relation existing set
This kind diagram invented year paper work named On Diagrammatic Mechanical Representation Propositions Reasonings John Venn Philosophical Magazine Journal Science used teach elementary set theory well illustrate simple set relationship logic linguistics probability computer science
Venn never used term Venn diagram referred invention Eulerian Circles
An scaled Venn diagram Venn diagram area shape proportional number element contains
Venn diagram general similar Euler diagram invented Leonhard Euler century
Baron noted Leibniz century produced similar diagram Euler unpublished
In century Venn diagram better developed Henderson showed existence diagram rotational symmetry implied n prime number mean natural number greater positive divisor
Henderson also showed symmetric Venn diagram exist n
In year Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagram n Griggs Killian Savage showed symmetric Venn diagram exist prime
Thus rotationally symmetric Venn diagram exist n prime number
Venn diagram Euler diagram incorporated part instruction set theory part new math movement
Since also adopted curriculum field
A Venn diagram built using collection simple closed curve plane
The principle diagram class also known set represented region relation one another possible logical relation class set indicated diagram
That diagram initially leaf room possible relation class
The actual given relation within diagram specified indicating particular region null
Venn diagram normally comprise overlapping circle
The inner part circle aid symbol represents element set
The exterior though implies element included set
For example Venn diagram one circle may represent group object made wood another circle may represent set table
The overlapping region would represent set wooden table
Any shape circle employed shown Venn higher set diagram
Venn diagram contain information relative absolute size set similar Euler diagram mentioned
However Venn diagram n component set must contain hypothetically possible zone correspond combination inclusion exclusion component set
The difference Euler diagram Venn diagram Euler diagram contain actually possible zone given context
In Venn diagram though shaded zone may represent empty zone
At time Euler diagram corresponding zone missing diagram
As example imagine one set representing dairy product another one cheese
In case Venn diagram contains zone cheese dairy product
Thus context cheese mean type dairy product Euler diagram cheese zone entirely contained within one zone cheese
In case Euler diagram typically le visually complex similar Venn diagram especially number intersection small

A type used related field describe behavior system
State diagram require system described composed finite number sometimes indeed case time reasonable
Many form state diagram exist differ slightly different
State diagram used give abstract description
This behavior analyzed represented series event occur one possible state
Hereby diagram usually represents object single class track different state object system
State diagram used graphically represent
This introduced book The Mathematical Theory Communication
Another source book Sequential Machines Automata Theory
Another possible representation
A classic form state diagram FA following element Q Σ Z δ q F The output function ω represents mapping ordered pair input symbol state onto output symbol denoted mathematically
For DFA NFA GNFA input denoted edge
For input output signified edge separated slash denotes state change upon encountering symbol causing symbol output
For state output usually written inside state circle also separated state designator slash
There also variant combine two notation
For example state number output
motor caution light diagram reflect
designates state output
This designator written inside state circle
state
Each edge labeled input
This example show acceptor string contain even number zero
state
Each edge labeled input output
gaining widespread usage since variant become part UML
The diagram type allows modeling activity part state
Classic state diagram require creation distinct node every valid combination parameter define state
This lead large number node transition node simplest system
This complexity reduces readability state diagram
With Harel statecharts possible model multiple state diagram within statechart
Each state machine transition internally without affecting state machine statechart
The current state state machine statechart defines state system
The Harel statechart equivalent state diagram improves readability resulting diagram
There set semantics available represent state diagram
For example tool modeling designing logic embedded controller
These diagram like Harel original state machine support hierarchically nested state orthogonal region state action transition action
Newcomers state machine formalism often confuse
The figure show comparison flowchart
A state machine panel performs action response explicit event
In contrast flowchart panel b need explicit event rather transition node node graph automatically upon completion activity
Nodes flowchart edge induced graph state
The reason node flowchart represents program command
A program command action executed
So state applied program state result transition another state
In detail source code listing represents program graph
Executing program graph parsing interpreting result state graph
So program graph induces state graph
Conversion program graph associated state graph called unfolding program graph
The program graph sequence command
If variable exist state consists program counter keep track program execution next command applied
In case executing command program counter position state command executed
Executing command move program counter next command
Since program counter whole state follows executing command changed state
So command corresponds transition two state
Now consider full case variable exist affected program command executed
Then different program counter location program counter change variable might also change value due command executed
Consequently even revisit program command
loop imply program state
In previous case program would state whole state program counter program counter point position next command suffices specify state
However state includes variable change value program location different variable value meaning different state program state space
The term unfolding originates multiplication location producing state graph program graph
A representative example loop incrementing counter overflow becomes
Although loop executes increment command iteratively program graph executes cycle state space cycle line
This result state program location cycling combined counter value strictly increasing overflow different state visited sequence overflow
After overflow counter becomes initial state revisited state space closing cycle state space assuming counter initialized
The figure attempt show reversal role aligning arc state diagram processing stage flowchart
You compare flowchart assembly line manufacturing flowchart describes progression task beginning end transforming source code input object code output compiler
A state machine generally notion progression
The door state machine shown top article example advanced stage closed state compared opened state simply reacts differently event
A state state machine efficient way specifying particular behavior rather stage processing
An interesting extension allow arc flow number state number state
This make sense system allowed multiple state implies individual state describes condition partial aspect overall global state
The resulting formalism known
Another extension allows integration flowchart within Harel statecharts
This extension support development software event driven workflow driven

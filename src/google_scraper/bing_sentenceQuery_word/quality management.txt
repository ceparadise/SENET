Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position
Or I even bother Master CS since I already industry certification
said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

Dennis said hello I Dennis
I year old I believe I want career computer science
But I never well school I visual kind guy
Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers
tom said Hello everybody
The name Tom I actually getting ready throw CS degree Now majority high school year spent totally ignoring class filling lung MJ booze learning love take care apartment let alone Trust tell I probably worst candidate succeed field thats actually probably true fact
I terrible math I actually process making within month span school start also spending hour day learning code multiple resource online offer structured Java Ruby Python course work progress
I know much current hiring trend related industry internet decides throw know truly believe something waste time business worth totally right
IT WAS FOR YOU A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR factor everyone else like anything perception reality know much business point know successful anything requires want learn see guy seem made decision upon degree primary focus earn learn conclusion study promise fulfilling career without effort people making good money anywhere usually top updated frequently new tool new method new platform new idea better perform job like anything position never promised always someone wanting deliver better product give edge I trying say attitude work ethic set aside degree majority post Im seeing listed regarding CS bad major seem coming never really applied fullest extent otherwise would reason post downer post
The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get
business belt
Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year
Random Awesomeness said discourage people KIDS especially woman want computer please give reason people computer science
Wolfee GameZ said Yea boi game design would good choice knowing code knowing language
Would also help look animation easier opinion
Those two major thing used game
yeye John Doe said Hey everyone Thanks comment really helped
I college student getting basic way
I always loved computer I pretty good user level
I know HTML access command stuff I never formal education tried learn another coding language I never failed math generally making Bs As strongest subject
Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength

As every manager know new technology transforming product market business process entire industry revolutionizing business environment
Yet technology loom factor competition emphasis managerial book executive education class corporate training seminar soft art leadership change management employee motivation
In word science technology reshape essence business le useful concept management science seems
On reflection paradox surprising
The traditional scientific approach management promised provide manager capacity analyze predict control behavior complex organization led
But world manager currently inhabit often appears unpredictable uncertain even uncontrollable
Not long ago example Compaq Computer everybody model lean dynamic could successfully battle sluggish giant IBM
But like Dell Northgate arrived scene
Now yesterday today sluggish giant Compaq face painful task recreating radically changed competitive environment
In face dynamic volatile business world traditional mechanism scientific management seem le useful positively counterproductive
And science appears le le relevant practical concern manager
However problem may lie le shortcoming scientific approach management manager understanding science
What manager think scientific management based conception science current scientist would defend
What manager become preoccupied volatility business environment scientist also become preoccupied inherent volatility nature dynamic unpredictable unstable system natural world
Put simply traditional science focused analysis prediction control new science emphasizes chaos complexity
Today scientist developing powerful description way complex swarm mosquito computer program future trader commodity effectively uncertainty rapid change
And therein lie opportunity fruitful dialogue world management world science
The new rule complex behavior scientific research describes intriguing parallel organizational behavior many company trying encourage
Science long esteemed business source technological innovation may ultimately prove greatest value manager source something else useful new way looking world
The text reviewed suggest broad outline might become new scientific management
Their message management may indeed science manager think
To understand implication new science management start book coined term scientific In industrial engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor published magnum opus laid ground rule efficient industrial organization
Taylor book classic managerial literature
His idea shaped company across industrial spectrum defined task management generation manager
Frederick Winslow Taylor New York Harper
James Gleick New York Viking
Mitchell Waldrop New York Simon Schuster
Peter Senge New York Doubleday
Taylor book profoundly influenced concern time
In nineteenth century Newton law motion first used analyze force exerted complex physical system allowing scientist predict behavior system
Meanwhile principle thermodynamics elucidated second half nineteenth century provided one missing complete Newton conception physical world
Together theory allowed scientist calculate machine could function maximum efficiency
From opening page book Taylor preoccupied problem efficiency applies organization
When come natural resource argued people clearly understand need efficiency see feel waste material But larger waste human effort brought awkward inefficient movement men le visible le tangible vaguely According Taylor fundamental cause waste human effort unscientific management
In word thought manager focused much output work enough process work done
In workplace manager paid worker predetermined output usually type piecework system left work crew determine actual method work
Taylor disparaged approach calling initiative incentive system
It giving special inducement incentive employer hope even approximately get initiative It ironic read Taylor criticism today much emphasis placed encouraging employee initiative job crafting incentive system pay Still good reason Taylor saw initiative incentive part problem rather part solution
As long manager day depended work group decide work done way directly influence efficiency organization
Indeed traditional management inherently unstable system forced manager either rely coercion abdicate authority altogether
For example one common way manager tried boost productivity regularly raising piece rate worker met
But induced worker engage soldiering limit output intentionally order undermine established rate
Taylor solution substitution science individual judgment Managers separate planning work actual execution reserve choice method particular task done
By analyzing step work process creating standardized procedure step manager could identify one best method performing task would guarantee maximum efficiency
The best management true science Taylor wrote resting upon clearly defined law rule principle And law constituted understandable predictable controllable system
In past man first future system must In effect Taylor urged individual manager think scientist alone understands fundamental law system studying
For Taylor worker played passive role almost part apparatus experiment
Over book Taylor repeated general principle No matter job seemingly simple task science underlies workman act great amount much workman best suited actually work incapable either lack education insufficient mental capacity understand It manager armed scientific predisposition search general law rule understand true science work
But say Taylor ignored issue employee motivation psychological dimension work
On contrary major part concern accurate study motif influence That scientific management successful Taylor term manager must analyze reorganize work
They need effect complete revolution mental attitude worker
Yet even Taylor reflected scientific assumption belief motif influence men reduced scientific analysis control way physical activity shoveling iron cutting metal
In discussing employee motivation Taylor noted At first may appear matter individual observation judgment proper subject exact scientific But psychological law complicated subject exception owing fact complex human experimented Taylor maintained law kind apply large majority men unquestionably exist clearly defined great value guide dealing After lofty language Taylor actual suggestion
For example insisted productivity improvement based scientific management shared worker higher wage otherwise cooperate work reorganization
Other suggestion crude simplistic like major piece advice Never deal worker group deal one individual time
When men work gang individual efficiency fall almost invariably level worst man Taylor solution worker assigned individual task perform greatest possible isolation
But whatever one think specific suggestion share scientific regard reductionism breaking thing isolated part order better control
Indeed technique scientific planning department study standardization method tool many mean end
But Taylor urged reader confuse technique basic scientific principle
It standardization method adoption best implement working condition cooperation faster work assured
And duty enforcing adoption standard enforcing cooperation rest Frederick Taylor principle inaugurated revolution management organization work
In decade book publication Taylor idea contributed massive increase productivity standard living
However experience last year taught manager new business environment scientific principle recipe disaster
In market fragmentation work separation planning execution isolation worker create rigid organization adapt quickly change
As result manager must rethink fundamental element Taylor system work organization employee motivation task management
The majority new managerial team work group networked either direct indirect response inadequacy Taylor original model
Yet proliferation specific technique fundamental principle new managerial paradigm far clear
At current crossroad recent development science may prove helpful
Even Taylor codifying organizational system scientist beginning understand shortcoming scientific model system based
Within decade publication Taylor book new development relativity theory quantum extreme space time universe entirety subatomic particle law Newtonian physic broke
And recently scientist extended message uncertainty unpredictability everyday world
physic based Newton law motion posited neat correspondence cause effect
Scientists confident could reduce even complex behavior interaction simple law calculate exact behavior physical system far future
This conviction profoundly shaped Taylor analysis organization complex organism human work
But past decade scientist concluded many science traditional assumption way nature operates fundamentally wrong
Far predictable nature appears random throw dice
Chaos theory general term new model thing work probably best introduction book science writer James Gleick
According Gleick chief catalyst chaos theory research MIT meteorological scientist Edward Lorenz
In early Lorenz developed computer program simulated weather system
By plugging number representing initial state wind temperature Lorenz program churned subsequent weather pattern evolved time
Lorenz like scientist assumed small change initial condition fed computer would result correspondingly small change evolution entire system
To surprise discovered even minuscule change caused drastic alteration weather pattern
In effect slight breeze Idaho drop temperature Massachusetts could end changing balmy weather Florida hurricane month later
The effect defied intuition meteorologist previously understood science
Intrigued Lorenz puzzle scientist wide variety field began experimenting simulation physical system discover identical phenomenon
An infinitesimal change initial condition could profound effect evolution entire system
Take simple example water dripping faucet
Speed rate flow ever slightly pattern drop fall change radically
Repeat experiment pattern completely different
What pattern drip formation change way one model
Even powerful supercomputer predict next drip fall
What true weather dripping faucet proved equally true vast majority physical system
A slight shift temperature cause sudden turbulence pan water
A tiny accumulation charge trigger lightning bolt
A small shift fertility rate double population community gypsy moth
This basic minute change lead radical deviation behavior natural inaugurated equally radical shift scientist see world
Put simply emphasis predictability control given way late appreciation power randomness chance
For practical purpose behavior even relatively simple physical system fundamentally unpredictable
But say chaotic system pattern
While idea nature fundamentally random counterintuitive chaos theory second basic insight even pattern lurk beneath seemingly random behavior system
In fact system end anywhere certain path apparently make least occur much chaos theorist call path strange Thus meteorologist say certainty weather particular day future estimate probability kind weather likely occur
In word strange attractor allow scientist determine within broad statistical parameter system likely never exactly system likely
The precision traditional physic replaced statistical estimate probability
In addition scientist identify predictable pattern system turned head
Instead trying break system component part analyze behavior part reductionist tradition influenced scientist learn holistic approach
They focus increasingly dynamic overall system
Rather attempting explain order designed part system emphasize order emerges interaction part whole
The quest gain insight make use order emerges chaotic system subject Mitchell Waldrop upcoming book
Waldrop contributing correspondent magazine describes recent research Santa Fe Institute New Mexico think tank specializing analysis system
The institute brought together eclectic group scientist focus way simple action independent component combine produce extremely complex behavior even absence central intelligence control
Santa Fe chemist example examining molecule organize protein
Biologists determining cell arrange immune system
And economist considering limited action individual buyer seller form complex market industry economy
In process Santa Fe researcher developed basic rule Waldrop call complex adaptive These system Waldrop claim among successful nature
Some example include ecology tropical rain forest colony ant even human brain
Such system several characteristic common
First consist network agent act independently one another without guidance central control
For example one brain roughly billion neuron kind miniature chemical computer follows independent pattern behavior
Take neuron brain still function
There master neuron central area brain control neuron
Yet agent capable engaging cooperative behavior
They form group community cooperate producing behavior single agent could accomplish
In brain neuron connected million others
Some community neuron clustered particular area brain specialize function language visual recognition
It precisely interaction among neuron produce human intelligence
For example structural difference individual squid neuron human neuron relatively small
However human brain contains many neuron squid also organization neuron much complex interwoven
A particular kind feedback make possible
In sense system learning system specific sort
Capable learning feedback external environment also embed learning actual structure
For instance set neuron involved piece mental recognizing face solving mathematical stronger actual chemical connection among neuron easier brain make connection next time
Indeed human brain forever reconfiguring connection neuron response external internal stimulus
In way system constantly rearrange effect previous action change external condition ripple system
Information embedded structure
As external condition change structure system automatically change
Finally learning feedback allow system operate flexible system usually contain array specialized behavioral niche occupied specific agent group agent
However old niche constantly disappear new one created external environment change
Therefore agent permanently locked previously useful behavior since become obsolete help system whole adapt change
Waldrop note system tend change rapidly completely becomes meaningless talk agent group agent optimizing term redolent focus efficiency behavior
Rather system characterized Waldrop call perpetual In general complex adaptive system found nature contain individual agent network create highly organized behavior respond feedback environment adjust behavior accordingly learn experience embed learning structure system reap advantage specialization without getting stuck rigidity
If characteristic sound familiar closely match new kind organization many manager struggling create order cope frequently environment
According Waldrop complexity researcher applied concept emerging field specific organizational problem manager face
But one area research Santa Fe Institute take step direction
Economists institute creating computer simulation economic transaction much Lorenz simulated weather system year ago
Their goal model complex market behavior constructing interaction limited set simple building block
Instead viewing economy kind Newtonian machine writes Waldrop would see something organic adaptive surprising Simulating economic behavior easy
Although programmer need model simple behavior individual agent let rest always clear simple behavior result simulation accurately reflects reality
So far Santa Fe researcher come convincing computer version entire economy
They however developed simulation represent limited aspect economic activity simulation produced quite realistic behavior
One program example simulates stock market
It consists agent decide buy sell stock
As real stock market action computerized trader determine price stock
At first trader made decision randomly soon came buy sell stock exactly classical economic theory say stock fundamental value set discount rate dividend
Still later simulation agent discovered studying history stock price performance could make money bidding stock actual value
The result computer system learned simulate kind bubble crash occur real market
Much chaos theory revealed shortcoming traditional physicist mathematical model world simulation pointed shortcoming elegant mathematical model neoclassical economist
For Santa Fe researcher stock market simulation start
They believe accurately simulate entire economy computer system could used word one scientist quoted Waldrop flight simulator economic decision making
Such program could estimate probability boom bust cycle simulate effect various government policy indicate change consumer business behavior might lead vital economy
In meantime one leading Santa Fe researcher founded Prediction Company commodity trading company make investment decision help computerized trading simulator
Chaos theorist complexity scientist may studying business organization perspective already shaped recent managerial literature
For example consider one popular managerial book last year MIT researcher Peter Senge
If Taylor chief concern inefficiency waste Senge chaos loss purpose frequently come wake
Most people Senge argues feel lost organization part
Managers overwhelmed much information many rapid change many conflicting demand
When asked living Senge writes people describe task perform every day purpose greater enterprise take part
Most see within system little influence
They job put time try cope force outside According Senge systematic inability cope complexity direct result traditional scientific approach management
From opening sentence attack reductionism center Taylor system science
From early age Senge note taught break apart problem fragment world
This apparently make complex task subject manageable pay hidden enormous price
We longer see consequence action lose intrinsic sense connection larger In sense manager position rather similar natural scientist
They understand relationship cause effect organization
But fact link action result infinitely complicated manager suspect
Senge call core learning dilemma organization today We learn best experience never directly experience consequence many important As result manager prisoner system supposed manage
They understand neither underlying dynamic system influence dynamic achieve organizational goal
Indeed idea manager omniscient scientific planner fundamentally misguided
According Senge The perception someone control based illusion anyone could master dynamic detailed complexity organization The alternative stop seeing organization begin viewing kind living organism
This requires holistic approach reflects chaos theory focus overall behavior system
Living system integrity Senge writes
Their character depends whole
The true organization understand challenging managerial issue requires seeing whole system generates Systems thinking fifth discipline Senge title
As portrays system thinking ability understand key interrelationship influence behavior complex system give manager capacity seeing Consider Senge story case based number real instance
After year blistering growth company call WonderTech experienced sudden sale
Desperate sustain growth senior manager hired salesperson aggressively pushed marketing
These action increase sale intended awhile
WonderTech entered period volatile swing high low demand eventually forced bankruptcy
In case study Senge trace source WonderTech failure management ignorance basic feedback process
Put simply high demand increased pressure company production capacity
Inadequate capacity meant large backlog order long delay delivery
Customers became angry dissatisfied caused sale drop
As Senge tell story senior manager understand sale grew company needed invest capacity
But fixed investment manufacturing increased need keep sale tendency push sale marketing get order
Because two side organizational never balance vicious circle high growth undercapacity delayed delivery customer dissatisfaction repeated continually growing worse
Senge note limited number feedback process work organization call system In sense organizational equivalent strange attractor chaos theory basic pattern behavior occur organization
The WonderTech story illustrates number archetype
Senge term one limit growth idea growth process produce condition collapse
The WonderTech focused sale created capacity problem retarded sale
Senge call another shifting burden idea solution problem may actually make worse undermining organization ability implement fundamental solution
Managers WonderTech became preoccupied boosting sale never able focus real solution problem expanding production capacity control delivery time
For Senge precisely systemic automatic quality process account control feeling many manager experience
Ignorant system archetype end always seeing part never whole
In contemporary organization argues work indeed understand systemic process driving human behavior change The art system thinking lie seeing complexity underlying structure generating When manager understand dynamic archetype able make deep connection system behavior position effect real change
And chaos theory teach small change big effect physical system crucial concept system theory leverage idea small action sometimes produce significant enduring In WonderTech case simple commitment rapid strategy managerial expert since enshrined rubric competing time done solve company problem salesperson world
If manager master system thinking discipline Senge describes result learning As Senge portrays learning organization characteristic remarkably similar complex adaptive system scientist discovering nature
It highly decentralized system number process local level maintain order throughout constantly adjust change
In effect Senge discipline meant replicate human organization organic control found nature
One interesting discussion book concern tool organization creating help manager develop skill need make organic control work
Take example microworlds simulation complex business situation based principle system thinking
With microworlds manager experiment organization reveal largely hidden dynamic complex system much scientist use simulation weather water dripping faucet learn physical system work
At MIT Sloan School example business student use microworld simulating rise fall People Express airline
With explore interrelated force period caused People Express lurch one fastest growth rate airline industry history sudden financial crisis eventual purchase competitor
At Hanover Insurance Company manager train claim learning laboratory microworlds simulate process adjuster settle claim insurance industry
By allowing user try alternative approach solving business problem system help manager deepen understanding system part
Microworlds also allow manager recognize strange attractor may underlie behavior organization thus identify strategy change
As language experiment laboratory suggests Senge new manager every bit much scientist Taylor course scientist different sort
As Senge put scientific manager today must researcher study organization
And must designer create learning process make possible process essential effective performance world characterized perpetual novelty change

Health Catalyst stand highest overall score healthcare BI market Posted
Few people influence science practical application process management
His impact automotive industry legendary many industry tried varying degree success implement principle well
For year I followed admired tried bring quality improvement process healthcare
I strongly believe healthcare much gain successfully implementing key Deming principle
Let share five principle I believe make biggest difference
When Deming others developed approach modern quality improvement basically developing way modern organization deal complex challenge confronting
The approach developed improvement remarkably simple yet extraordinarily powerful
It centered fact quality improvement really process management
These quality improvement concept technique used transform almost every major industry world dramatic result
The last holdout last passion resistance primarily healthcare higher education government
Now happening healthcare
I believe higher education imminent anyone guess whether government ever succumb force
Now know healthcare complex fundamentally different industry
Healthcare simply consists thousand interlinked process result complex system
If focus process care one time fundamentally change game deal challenge facing healthcare
Now may seem like tall order tell u probably percent process get u percent impact
So challenge every organization identify percent roll sleeve begin important work addressing challenge
Deming clearly understood importance data
Meaningful
This particularly true quality control healthcare
You basically dead water try work healthcare provider good data
I think everybody recognizes
Deming said In God others must bring I love quote reflects reality
I physician career tell pretty much thing quite polite
They basically say Dr
Haughom John get lost
Bring data
And decide believe So data critical going meaningful impact healthcare
An important application clarification Deming principle put forward good friend
Managing care mean managing process care
It mean managing physician nurse
What James said true
One big mistake made managed care movement naively thinking managing care meant telling physician nurse
The reality need process understand care delivery process best equipped figure improve process care time
And reason I strongly believe change fact ultimately empowering clinician try get involved
If clinician going manage care need data
They need right data delivered right format right time right place
And data must delivered right clinician involved operating improving given process care
If quality improvement going work going realize mean must engage clinician
To use Deming term clinician healthcare smart They frontline worker understand process care
And I said earlier slide fortunate healthcare workforce dominated clinician extraordinarily committed intelligent highly educated
But live pristine time
I received email fellow physician leader leading national delivery system
I going withhold name delivery system I tell ask knowledgeable people list top delivery system country almost everyone would put organization list
Despite physician wrote lamenting difficult get peer physician see new future
And email succinctly described problem saying physician historically encumbered And I love succinctness description basically saying clinging past demoralized see new future
And short phrase excellent physician leader pretty much encapsulated problem point u towards solution
A clearly demonstrates majority physician fact willing change
McKinsey US physician found percent said willing change reasonable course argument could made change necessary
So reconcile
I believe need help clinician figure give past helping see new future help understand role creating sustaining new future
In fact I believe one make strong case future empowering clinician type successfully inform engage inspire
Applying key Deming principle healthcare process improvement help every healthcare organization show workforce change necessary need understand participate meaningful change success ultimately look like

After year performed successful transition planned economy
Along change China healthcare system also experienced significant reform follow adapt historical revolution
In data released MoH indicated national expenditure billion totally accounted nationwide gross domestic product
Before entire healthcare cost covered central government annual budget
Since construct supporter started change gradually
Most expenditure contributed health insurance scheme private spending corresponded total expenditure respectively
Meanwhile financially governmental contribution decreased
On hand healthcare facility recorded statistic summary MoH average clinical bed per people mentioned well
Along development information technology since healthcare provider realised information could generate significant benefit improve service computerised case data instance gaining information directing patient care assessing best patient care specific clinical condition
Therefore substantial resource collected build China health informatics system
Most resource arranged construct HIS aimed minimise unnecessary waste repetition subsequently promote efficiency healthcare
By China successfully spread HIS approximately nationwide hospital
However dispersion HIS varies critically
In east part China hospital constructed HIS northwest China equivalent
Moreover CDC rural level approximately healthcare organisation rural level hospital town level ability perform transmission report epidemic situation public health information system analysis infectious disease dynamic statistic
China four tier healthcare system

In conclusion agreed strongly agreed providing health information Internet utilized
Collected information different time different participant system could frequently lead issue misunderstanding
To design system healthcare provider realised certain standard basis sharing information interoperability however system lacking standard would large impediment interfere improvement corresponding information system
Given standardisation health informatics depends authority standardisation event must involved government subsequently relevant funding support critical
In Ministry Health released Development National Health Informatics indicating identification standardisation health informatics adoption international standard development national standard
In China establishment standardisation initially facilitated development vocabulary conducive reserve transmit information premium management national level
By domestic standard vocabulary classification coding served hospital information system
In revision International Statistical Classification Diseases Related Health Problems adopted standard diagnostic classification acute care procedure classification
Simultaneously ICPC translated tested China local applied environment
Another coding standard named LOINC applied serve general identifier clinical observation hospital
Personal identifier code widely employed different information system involving name sex nationality family relationship educational level job occupation
However code within different system inconsistent sharing different region
Considering large quantity vocabulary classification coding standard different jurisdiction healthcare provider realised using multiple system could generate issue resource wasting national level standard beneficial necessary

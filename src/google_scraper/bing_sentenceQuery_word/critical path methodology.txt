project management tool look two item
The first item critical path look long project take complete end date
The second item critical path methodology look activity completed time project take longer complete
Those activity must completed time considered
Critical path sequence activity allows fastest completion project
The first step determining project critical path determining list activity duration activity take complete project
For example use widget manufacturing process The second step determine sequence activity predecessor activity
A predecessor activity occur current activity
Add duration activity
The duration activity take determines critical activity
Draw network diagram
Generally network diagram drawn using activity node place line meet
Using activity node allow quick interpretation activity relationship
Identify path
Now identify path project manager must look routing determine path
For example two path Path highlighted yellow Path highlighted blue
Determining critical path
Since two path project manager know one critical path
Here duration applied
Next add duration path
So first path duration
For Path duration
Path duration Path gas duration
The path longer duration critical path
For example Path critical path
The critical path highlighted red
Get FREE access day create account
Now calculated critical path project manager manage critical path
As reminder set activity completed time make project end date extend
So manage critical path
The easy answer carefully
The complex answer carefully
Critical path managed carefully project manager I spend time monitoring critical activity
A project manager must manage critical activity maximum possible
If activity extend end date project extend
I spend remaining time managing activity
A project manager must monitor activity avoid one extending going critical path
You may find situation finish project faster critical path analysis say
You two option crashing fast tracking
project shorten duration activity
This shorten critical path
To project manager may assign resource increase cost project
project activity performed series performed parallel
Fast tracking increase cost increase risk activity working parallel require strict management
In lesson learned set activity extend project end date
Those activity critical path called

If PMBK definition critical path puzzled read Andrew Makar explanation project methodology term
By When I business analyst working human resource talent acquisition implementation six week launch date project manager rushed u room asked u figure critical path
I heard term critical path I really understand meant
I knew project critical HR organization thought everything project critical path
Project manager amused trying figure critical path six week launch rather prior project execution
In hindsight project manager known critical path earlier monitoring schedule progress
I still find puzzling project manager asked bunch business system analyst determine project critical path
It I shifted career project management I gained better understanding critical path impact project
The Project Management Body Knowledge PMBOK defines critical path sequence schedule activity determines duration project
Project manager also apply critical path methodology technique determine amount float various logical network path project schedule network determine minimum total project duration
If confused PMBOK speak I let restate way easier understand
The critical path simply task determine end date project schedule
If one task late one day project end date extended one day
Oftentimes task critical path due slack project schedule
If refer current schedule examine Gantt chart quickly identify task float compared task slack
In Figure A five task project schedule Task project critical path
If Task delayed entire project delayed
If Task delayed seven day free slack start impact schedule
Since Task three day duration Task could actual duration day becomes part project critical path
If exceeds day Task create new critical path
I admit I reluctant create network diagram start forward backward pas mechanic
Tools invented reason fortunately Microsoft Project support forecasting analysis detailed scheduling metric along critical path
By switching different view formatting Gantt chart quickly identify monitor task project critical path
In next column I show identify critical path Microsoft Project use different view monitor track critical path
If want learn critical path network sensitivity read article
The article feature sample Microsoft Project file want experiment adjusting critical path

In book Exercise show piece code compute value polynomial The exercise assumes clock cycle needed addition multiplication respectively
The reader asked explain According exercise answer iteration need update variable operation need addition multiplication latter dominates latency causing ultimate CPE
But I think data flow something like So longest path previous value new value going execution unit
Therefore longest time cycle
I want ask Any explanation CPU architecture execution unit pipeline unit appreciated
I know I bit late party book absolutely right
As verify timing code CPE indeed second answer wrong
But first one also wrong
It say MULs must performed time possible Nehalem architecture I suspect modern processor
Remember one FP MUL unit different FP ADD unit shown book ed
later What happens instead LOADs assumed always present cycle cache First feed MUL
Immediately feed remember pipeline
cycle get new value cycle result
At point new computation stage MUL
So cycle rest ops want restricted
Of course easy need cycle FP ADD get new
So becomes obvious limiting factor computation
Which mean looking critical path whatever look specifically path old value new
In case path consists one FP ADD
threw first The critical path indeed cycle question asks CPE like time output one cycle loop
Other first last cycle processor addition previous iteration loop current multiplication time operand dependent
The first iteration loop take full cycle iteration loop take cycle run making actual CPE cycle

I agree book way presenting critical path confusing
Their definition critical path simply path take longest path path also operation operand depends previous operation order
This definition make finding critical path rather intuitive
The critical path longest path graph case eight clock
This say critical path Prioritized Topological Orders Without resource constraint shortest schedule given critical path longest path graph
A metric useful priority function height node length longest path graph originating node
I think found error book
You consider contacting author correct future printing
The critical path longest one data flow graph according book must straight line effect single register rather add whose result intermediate operand next operation
About question get done continuing read rest
Especially comparing data flow graph one helpful
If understood clear answer book reasonable

If project management I sure already heard term path method
If new subject best start understanding path move path method
Critical path sequential activity start end project
Although many project one critical path project may one critical path depending flow logic used project
If delay activity critical path delay project deliverable
Most time delay occurred project acceleration done order achieve deadline
Critical path method based mathematical calculation used scheduling project activity
This method first introduced joint venture Remington Rand Corporation DuPont Corporation
The initial critical path method used managing plant maintenance project
Although original method developed construction work method used project interdependent activity
In critical path method critical activity program project identified
These activity direct impact completion date project
Let look critical path method used practice
The process using critical path method project planning phase six step
You use Work Breakdown Structure WBS identify activity involved project
This main input critical path method
In activity specification activity selected critical path method
When detailed activity used critical path method may become complex manage maintain
In step correct activity sequence established
For need ask three question task list
Which task take place task happens
Which task completed time task
Which task happen immediately task
Once activity sequence correctly identified network diagram drawn refer sample diagram
Although early diagram drawn paper number computer software Primavera purpose nowadays
This could direct input WBS based estimation sheet
Most company use estimation method COCOMO based function point based estimation method task estimation
You use estimation information step process
For need determine four parameter activity network
Earliest start time ES The earliest time activity start previous dependent activity
Earliest finish time EF ES activity duration
Latest finish time LF The latest time activity finish without delaying project
Latest start time LS LF activity duration
The float time activity time earliest ES latest LS start time earliest EF latest LF finish time
During float time activity delayed without delaying project finish date
The critical path longest path network diagram
The activity critical path effect deadline project
If activity path delayed project delayed
In case project management need accelerate project time critical path activity reduced
Critical path diagram live artefact
Therefore diagram updated actual value task completed
This give realistic figure deadline project management know whether track regarding deliverable
Following advantage critical path method Offers visual representation project activity
Presents time complete task overall project
Tracking critical activity
Critical path identification required phase
This give project management correct completion date overall project flexibility float activity
A critical path diagram constantly updated actual information project progress order refine activity duration prediction

Critical Path term field project management describing set tool methodology
The technical definition sequence networked work package path least amount slack
In practical term path sequence event delayed delay entire project
And even simpler term critical path sequence task take longest complete deliver project
Critical Path Project Management describes methodology managing controlling project using distinct set tool
Project manager work define work required complete project achieve
The work typically broken unit called work package
These work package small enough size associated owner managed risk controlled time cost material
Work package small meaningless work package large provide basis effective management control
A commonly described benchmark work package take le eight hour complete eighty hour
It course may vary depending upon nature project
Each work team defines estimate duration cost work package
The project manager pool work package sequence order must completed
The estimate duration sequence event used construct network diagram several key measure identified
These include These metric used calculate various path network producing duration identifying available slack individual work package
The project manager project team member typically adjust sequencing event look different option
Once resource defined work package sequenced yet looking efficient timely least risky project plan
The project team view actual path network one least amount available slack sometimes zero meaning item path delayed even one day project delayed correspondingly
It important note following Uses Critical Path The critical path important allows project manager team focus effort important work package
Common action focused critical path include While small project lend manual calculation critical path larger initiative thousand ten thousand work package project manager rely project management software program calculate describe project network diagram critical path
Nonetheless important project manager understands develop refine manage critical path

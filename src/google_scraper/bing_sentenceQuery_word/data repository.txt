Data repository somewhat general term used refer destination designated data storage
However many IT expert use term specifically refer particular kind setup within overall IT structure group database enterprise organization chosen keep various kind data
Some expert refer data repository partitioning data partitioned data type stored together
It also commonly called data warehousing
One simple premise kind setup keeping different kind data together yet separated database container business leader facilitate data mining related research help overall planning
One issue pursuing construction data repository security
It may make sense massive amount data collected one physical space case remote backup may critical aspect securing data

Data Science NYU There much debate among scholar practitioner data science
Does deal big data
What constitutes big data
Is data science really new
How different statistic analytics
In virtually area intellectual inquiry data science offer powerful new approach making discovery
By combining aspect statistic computer science applied mathematics visualization data science turn vast amount data digital age generates new insight new knowledge

A database repository logical also sometimes physical grouping data related separate database
This usually done purpose data data item needed reside different database
In case repository necessary bring together discrete data item operate one
Database repository usually discussed implemented realm data warehousing business intelligence
This usually requires level aggregation data database simply provide thus necessitating creation structure
Consider case large bank
Such institution likely composed several different subsidiary physical sense rather functional sense
There traditional bank account division addition loan division forex treasury division investment banking division safe deposit division
All division run separate information system course implies separate database
However division must report financials back head office
The Chief Financial Officer CFO need aggregate financial data various division gauge profitability feed directly bank overall financial position
You see CFO office really concerned operational part various database really interested data deal financials
Another thing note relies completely division reporting inform decision take generate data
Enter data repository
This likely another system database distinct others directly access relevant data database aggregate meaningful information CFO
However important remember data information CFO looking may may physically located data repository
The repository may simply read direct database performance reason may store local copy data accessed others
The repository likely include ability show performance trend time compare contrast division target show deviation along period
Some goal clearly context Business Intelligence
Also since CFO mostly interseted reporting opposed data input generation data repository likely system one minimal writes addition aggregating data going back long period
This function start cross context Data Warehousing
A data repository thus logical aggregation data item separate database one centralized location specific purpose achieved using database

By Reviewed Murray Anderegg Documentation Subversion available
This online SVN book
Computer Services hard copy available
Subversion centralized system sharing information
At core repository central store data
The repository store information form typical hierarchy file directory
Any number connect repository read write file
By writing data client make information available others reading data client receives information others
So interesting
So far sound like definition typical file server
And indeed repository kind file server usual breed
What make Subversion repository special ever written change every file even change directory tree addition deletion rearrangement file directory
When client read data repository normally see latest version filesystem tree
But client also ability view state filesystem
For example client ask historical question What directory contain last Wednesday Who last person change file change make These sort question heart system designed track change data time
To create Subversion repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department
Personal CVS repository created CVS server project repository created CVS server
After CVS repository created subversion repository must created
Login create repository svnadmin create If wish run multiple subversion repository CVS server need create subdirectory repository create subversion repository subdirectory
Access Subversion repository currently ONLY using SSH available user account Department Computer Science
Access web http based repository currently managed Computer Services requested sending email help
We strongly suggest use key authentication SSH prompted password file committed
This make process committing Subversion change atomic le painful
A document describing setup key authentication Linux Windows available
The Subversion repository currently residing Linux server filesystem running POSIX draft file ACLs
The process sharing repository collaborating others require modifying ACLs
For information Linux file ACLs see man page setfacl getfacl see two web page longer active
Here example adding user anderegg repository
You need set extended ACLs repository
Login cv cd repository setfacl user anderegg rwX
setfacl user anderegg rwX
To remove access user anderegg cd repository setfacl user anderegg
setfacl user anderegg
NOTE Both command need run make change permission everything existing without everything created future default
There cron job sweep repository performs chown owner repository everything within case different user creates file within repository
It far beyond scope document describe detail using Subversion
The department longer local copy tutorial
There tutorial available online
Recommendations tutorial welcome submitted maintainer document
The process getting started Subversion may take bit time plan try Subversion repository try tutorial get speed
Users allocated space personal Subversion repository
Projects allocated space Subversion repository
As late department added support accessible Subversion repository
These repository accessible SSH
Instead repository accessed URL beginning Users need request web based Subversion repository time repository creation based different part filesystem
Access permission web based repository managed Computer Services
Therefore request access change directed help
If wish share Subversion repository user two option Buy Computer Science cvsonly account allows SSH access CVS server
Request Subversion repository beginning

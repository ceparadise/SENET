QC similar identical quality assurance
QA defined procedure set procedure intended ensure product service development work complete opposed afterwards meet specified requirement
QA sometimes expressed together QC single expression quality assurance control
In order implement effective QC program enterprise must first decide specific product service must meet
Then extent QC action must determined example percentage unit tested lot
Next data must collected example percentage unit fail result reported management personnel
After corrective action must decided upon taken example defective unit must repaired rejected poor service repeated charge customer satisfied
If many unit failure instance poor service occur plan must devised improve production service process plan must put action
Finally QC process must ongoing ensure remedial effort required produced satisfactory result immediately detect recurrence new instance trouble

Software Quality Assurance SQA includes testing critical part software development maintenance
While software publisher content allowing discover report bug crowdsourced testing company probably prefer capture fix bug public
To accomplish latter mean either team tester SQA engineer delegate role software development team
Either way software testing quality assurance typically requires large number tool technique

Even room important category
Tools listed run computer testing software intended desktop Web mobile
While image viewer screen recording software directly part testing important part overall process test data file capturing visuals human sometimes programmatic review
Depending scope testing may need access remote computer able run multiple operating system workstation
These apps cover need remote access OS virtualization
If worked operating system including Mac OS X probably familiar wealth commandline tool available part OS including bash grep sed awk perl head tail diff p find many
These tool allows user manipulate information set batch process timed automation many action many useful software testing process
If worked Windows OSes know tool common OS X missing
Fortunately equivalent tool available separately Windows computer
Data essential part complex software desktop application Web mobile apps

Keep mind even say choice database client used production application may influence test database associated tool list get started option
Tools useful even essential testing Web site fall three main category desktop tool including browser tool run browser tool run commandline might function localized temporary Web server
The tool section fall first category
See Web Mobile Testing Tips Techniques section Chrome browser
This mean exhaustive list merely starting point
Here browser plugins occasional free Web service play strong role Web site testing
Search Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox marketplace type plugin looking see
For complex software likely going need tool either run commandline Windows DOS OS X act local Web server running either Firefox Chrome possibly headless browser
Here handiest option Web site testing
Test automation tool testing framework make life easier setting running test case regular basis
The framework listed cover tool Windows commandline typically option
An important part overall SQA process managing rule protocol test case etc
This set tool cover software primarily team collaboration document spreadsheet user story tracking diagramming
Most either tool desktop application

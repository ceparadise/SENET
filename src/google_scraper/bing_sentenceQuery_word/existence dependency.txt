I researched question ca find consensus
If A depends B term dependency refer Does term different meaning different subdomains computer technology
B would dependency
You probably use dependency form B dependency A
I suppose Option also partly true dependency describes relationship
In UML mean method capable instantiating object method call like Or get function parameter But actually store object field variable becomes association
Here true

In degree interdependence software module measure closely connected two routine module strength relationship module
Coupling usually contrasted
often correlate high cohesion vice versa
Low coupling often sign good design combined high cohesion support general goal high readability maintainability
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured design including cohesion coupling published article book latter subsequently became standard term
Coupling low also loose weak high also tight strong
Some type coupling order highest lowest coupling follows A module refers subroutine kind
set one statement name preferably set variable name
In recent work various coupling concept investigated used indicator different modularization principle used practice
Tightly coupled system tend exhibit following developmental characteristic often seen disadvantage Whether loosely tightly coupled system performance often reduced message parameter creation transmission translation
marshaling message interpretation might reference string array data structure require le overhead creating complicated message message
Longer message require CPU memory produce
To optimize runtime performance message length must minimized message meaning must maximized
One approach decreasing coupling seek limit responsibility module along functionality
Coupling increase two class Low coupling refers relationship one module interacts another module simple stable interface need concerned module internal implementation see
Systems allow object communicate without know anything object implementation
Both system even allow object communicate object written language
Coupling term occur together frequently
Coupling refers interdependency module cohesion describes related function within single module
Low cohesion implies given module performs task related hence create problem module becomes large
Coupling Software Engineering describes version metric associated concept
For data control flow coupling For global coupling For environmental coupling make value larger coupled module
This number range approximately low coupling highly coupled For example module single input output data parameter If module input output data parameter equal number control parameter access item global data

Learn something new every day email Uploading downloading term used refer type electronic data transfer
The difference direction file transferred
Files considered uploaded transferred computer electronic device central server downloading file transferred server smaller peripheral unit computer device
These two different type transfer often done via Internet file downloaded website
The transfer data one system device similar system device laptop usually considered uploading downloading
The common type uploading user uploads digital file Internet site
For example user might vacation photo social networking website home video video sharing site
The uploaded file stored website server seen anyone necessary right software viewing
Other website allow user upload digital file storage
This allow user store file larger file would possible store computer device limited storage capacity
Uploading file storage website also allows user device access
Permission access file granted certain people file could made public anyone access
Another type uploading take place within closed computer system one within single office building one connects group business
These type system typically server store information need shared among multiple computer device
Digital file uploaded computer device connected system downloaded accessed user system
Whenever electronic file information transferred central system computer device connected system considered downloading
Files downloaded temporarily deleted used downloaded permanent basis used long period time
For example funny video file might downloaded Internet soon deleted watched helpful application might downloaded used month year
Downloaded file sometimes automatically stored particular location computer device automatically accessed location needed
An example application downloaded smartphone user typically control app stored phone simply stored phone store apps
In case user choose downloaded file stored
For example laptop user might music file specific folder music another type file computer desktop found quickly
The time take upload download file depends several factor
The main factor digital size file measured byte
The larger file longer take transfer information
The quality connection Internet central server smaller computer device also make difference transfer speed
A computer Internet connection able download upload file much quickly computer connection would
In addition speed server file stored affect upload time download time
Uploading downloading occur frequently often without user aware
For example incoming downloaded server outgoing email uploaded sent
The web page downloaded user computer view content
Whenever computer device connected Internet another larger system file frequently transferred back forth uploaded downloaded throughout normal course use
If I transferring file computer client workstation I uploading computer downloading computer
I use Hamachi server remote view cctv camera
apply fixed IP address video streaming faster
currently streaming four Mbps ADSL line fixed IP address Hamachi HSDPA
It channel capture card stream one port time
My pc spec high core duo

One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day
Thank helping improve wiseGEEK

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
Uploading transmission file one computer system another usually larger computer system
From network user upload file send another computer set receive
People share image others bulletin board service upload file BBS
Transmission direction one usually larger computer another usually smaller computer
From Internet user downloading receiving file another computer
The File Transfer Protocol Internet facility downloading uploading file
If uploading file another site must usually permission advance access site directory file placed
When send receive attached file note attachment download upload
However practice many people use upload mean send download mean receive
The term used loosely practice someone say Download upload file via simply mean Send
In short ordinary workstation small computer user upload send file download receive file

A central part
It manages operation computer notably memory time
There two type kernel A computer user never interacts directly kernel
It run behind scene seen except text log print
The kernel fundamental part operating system
It thought program control program computer
When computer start go initialization function checking memory
It responsible assigning unassigning memory space allows software run
It provides service program request use disk piece hardware kernel forward request special program called control hardware manages set interrupt enable
Many kernel also responsible ensuring faulty program interfere operation others denying access memory allocated restricting amount CPU time consume
commonly use monolithic kernel
In example often made part kernel specifically Loadable Kernel Modules
When device needed extension loaded onto kernel word making kernel larger
Monolithic kernel make trouble one driver faulty graphic driver downloaded
Because part kernel often override mechanism deal faulty program see
This mean kernel thus entire computer cease function
If many device kernel also run memory causing system crash making computer slow
Microkernels way solving problem
In microkernel operating system kernel deal critical activity controlling memory CPU nothing else
Drivers function monolithic kernel would normally within kernel moved outside kernel control
Instead uncontrollable part kernel beta driver therefore unlikely cause crash beta web browser driver go wrong simply restarted kernel
Unfortunately creating microkernel based operating system difficult operating system like commonly used
microkernel operating system

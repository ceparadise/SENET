Alfred Thompson blog teaching computer science level
Alfred high school computer science teacher year
He also taught grade computer specialist
I saw side side comparison bunch scripting language online recently
My first second reaction yuck
Now I bias bias may shared others course
But I like readable code anytime I see special character anything alphanumeric slows
This got thinking going design programming language
Are moving forward ever mean backwards sideways
Back I started programming close year ago big three programming language FORTRAN COBOL coming language called BASIC
FORTRAN short FORmula TRANSlation used mathematician math major brother learn scientist
COBOL B stand Business used business application
BASIC language spreading business
COBOL loved hated different people wordiness
But least understandable
Take loop Which one obvious
Pretend experienced programmer
BASIC Visual Basic case somewhere middle
The step counting easily understandable least
Now let take look something simple
This drive beginner crazy
What going
Sure programmer know lot beginner struggle direction operation going
Compare code COBOL Wordy
Sure least even beginner read
Now I arguing go back COBOL though honestly modern IDEs feature like Intellisence would lot easier back I typing punch card
Rather I suggesting beginner language probably wordy rather obscure English easier pick programming language mean Just fun want see different programming language really look like visit site
This Website hold collection Song programmed different programming language
Actually song represented different programming language variation
Most language look like gibberish comparison Powershell
ForEach Computer TextFile Computer That close English get scripting language
For ultimate
code google obfuscation read The Twelve Days Christmas written For language designed martian OASIS precise check XACML sometimes
Yes language
An functional language access control
Sets scale
Rich PowerShell syntax horrible
Just language read like English mean readable
So PS team response comment syntax Rich PowerShell syntax horrible
Just language read like English mean readable
PS team response comment syntax terrible Visual Basic prettiest syntax imo
What AppleScript
Tell application Finder sleep End tell WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM For WSBOTTLENUM To Step correct WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM Cobra clean syntax small bit code larger construct like class method
I guess based mistake done COBOL C running loop infinite BASIC obvious easier beginner
k VS divide giving k Can see difference number character used represent statement
It obvious used extensively code
So would like use multiply subtract Add Just one character compared word save great deal time k VS divide giving k Can see difference number character used represent statement
It obvious used extensively code
So would like use multiply subtract Add Just one character compared word save great deal time I still use COBOL every get paid dam well I might add I first started hand coded gragh paper operator entered via terminal ha day
You might laugh paid house I use php c like second language also COBOL ADA remain high like list
The COBOL example wordy eye borderline incomprehensible
It English word bizarre phrasing
Applescript poster mentioned much like English quite easy program least going experience similar Hyperscript
Beginners important learn syntax quite quickly
Clarity readability important people read lot code necessarily equate lot English word
I know one language Visual Basic little bit
I concur Alfred nearer language natural language user easier therefore better least point view With mainstream language Fortran came Cobol shortly
The today arguably Java maybe C
Not exactly brilliant progress year
For speaking programmer closeness English verbosity
BTW I remember part C popularity stemmed getting rid English nonsense Pascal DECLARE A AS ARRAY OF INTEGER nice school class type God forbid quickly start appreciate int A In end learn language type every day How example APL really screw head
This following expression generates typical set Pick lottery number six integer ranging guaranteed display sorted ascending order x My favourite English go language Revolution AKA LiveCode originally came MetaCard Apple HyperCard system designed Windows Unix Rev support three platform
Nothing like Local tFadeLimit Put Into tFadeLimit Repeat For Times Subtract From tFadeLimit Set The BlendLevel Of This Stack To tFadeLimit Wait For Tick End Repeat For window fade view
COBOL supposed usable management self documenting
The usable management part never worked
It used business environment big lpm printer
The folk developed C people programming teletypes running baud
They time wordy language
Code modern language le readable
You would want thinking read gasp
write code
It depends character used
In language like Tcl Scheme Forth syntax extremely simple
The documentation big list symbol see
code dig language syntax manual try parse
Just look symbol index
Your example good one COBOL easier someone never written code read someone trying write learn anything
What want add another subexpression
Now need learn syntax
Calling set
function easy C programmer learn newbie learn also make easy extend knowledge
WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM Yeah run block exactly
I able pretend I programmer something like wsb seems easier remember syntax look like english follow syntactical grammatical rule
Wordy stuff OK type
Most programmer still finger typist
A perform statement would take lot longer something brace parenthesis
Like language matter getting used
In GEORGE III JCL could write WE COMERR GO In long form GEORGINA WHENEVER COMMAND ERROR GOTO Initially everyone used WHENEVER version
After minute two finger typing lot swearing class magically shifted two letter acronym
Maybe need programming language long form short form mix
Hey C read WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM I would point divide giving k fine try writing COBOL might find readable longer
COBOL also feature virtually control structure utter lack class object
If want teach people Pidgin English fine teaching COBOL cripple mind irreversibly regarded capital offence Dijkstra correct
Hey C read WSBOTTLENUM WSBOTTLENUM I would point divide giving k fine try writing COBOL might find readable longer
COBOL also feature virtually control structure utter lack class object
If want teach people Pidgin English fine teaching COBOL cripple mind irreversibly regarded capital offence Dijkstra correct
First let destroy first idea It readable ONLY English I speak English birth language Italian I grow speaking Spanish
Now think thousand people even use alphabet system instead Cyrillic Arabic Indian Chinese etc etc
Also limited number construct like loop symbolic structure actually make easier learn
Finally learn language want able much possible little word C oriented programmer totally hate anything longer establish code block
I think paying attention Python
It get much concise readable
N You reread C syntax THIS form code execute ZERO time abort condition checked loop entered I think comparison C bit unfair C never meant readible efficient
What would following loop look like COBOL One point totally missed language read easily debugged supported easily
Having maintaining old code number logic error high code cost detecting huge technological debt many organisation gut wrenching
Just look error article minor bit code
If non expert read supposed going code pick logic importantly BUSINESS error cheaper
COBOL intended Accountants Auditors Management review logic Programmers often understand business logic professional design software
You DO software designed
Hmmm
Did anyone catch
Your right sir
cobol seems readable
experienced programmer c style make reading faster
There another great languge
It verbose clear much way C
And programmer never wrote COBOL would miss divide
statement My previous post newbie learning programming language first time
Now enjoy writing Javascript JAVA C language might want try APL
In APL could write program would literally take hundred line C code
It would also give chance brush Greek becasue woukld probably Greek
The issue verbosity mastery
COBOL BASIC program verbose long le per line C Python program end quite inefficient
Good instruction perhaps inefficient
I always impression language curve
I learned BASIC moved C ilk I learning bit functional programming Haskell
In end moving

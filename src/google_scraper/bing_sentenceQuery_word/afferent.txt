I live normal residential street Puget Sound area Washington interstate highway mile away
To get house exit one limited place interstate drive connector street little street
In body artery interstate connector street mesh little residential street capillary bed
I always loved history well science I talked parent letting learn Latin instead useful modern language
Being able read Julius Caesar memoir help get college sure helpful today understanding biology
Consider
Afferent always mean road IN efferent always mean way
So arteriole connector interstate highway residential street capillary nephron glomerulus
This filtration occurs kidney
But afferent arteriole much interactive exciting connector role suggests play active role regulating blood pressure
Think structure individual nephron blood filtered capillary network glomerular capsule filtrate travel proximal tubule distal tubule collected ureter
Proximal another word Julius Caesar would understand mean
Distal come Latin root always structure farthest away
If flow filtate distal tubule slows concentration sodium ion filtrate cross specific threshold value cell distal tubule far end nephron remember
release prostaglandin
The prostaglandin hormone carried local blood supply back afferent arteriole
Here really get interesting When afferent arteriole see upsurge prostaglandin release remember first step cascade
Now understand connector control blood pressure body
The hormone increase blood pressure signal nephron kidney reabsorb sodium ion back bloodstream
Those cell distal tubule also make afferent arteriole constrict releasing nitric oxide
By squeezing smaller pathway afferent arteriole increase local blood pressure capillary feed
This make perfect sense
The distal tubule cell see filtrate end process use nitric oxide prostaglandin give cell start process afferent arteriole feedback needed improve kidney function

Coupling usually contrasted
often correlate high cohesion vice versa
Low coupling often sign good design combined high cohesion support general goal high readability maintainability
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured design including cohesion coupling published article book latter subsequently became standard term
Coupling low also loose weak high also tight strong
Some type coupling order highest lowest coupling follows A module refers subroutine kind
set one statement name preferably set variable name
In recent work various coupling concept investigated used indicator different modularization principle used practice
Tightly coupled system tend exhibit following developmental characteristic often seen disadvantage Whether loosely tightly coupled system performance often reduced message parameter creation transmission translation
marshaling message interpretation might reference string array data structure require le overhead creating complicated message message
Longer message require CPU memory produce
To optimize runtime performance message length must minimized message meaning must maximized
One approach decreasing coupling seek limit responsibility module along functionality
Coupling increase two class Low coupling refers relationship one module interacts another module simple stable interface need concerned module internal implementation see
Systems allow object communicate without know anything object implementation
Both system even allow object communicate object written language
Coupling term occur together frequently
Coupling refers interdependency module cohesion describes related function within single module
Low cohesion implies given module performs task related hence create problem module becomes large
Coupling Software Engineering describes version metric associated concept
For data control flow coupling For global coupling For environmental coupling make value larger coupled module
This number range approximately low coupling highly coupled For example module single input output data parameter If module input output data parameter equal number control parameter access item global data

If quantify one thing quantify Cost Delay
Reinertsen prioritization model used sequence job Features Capabilities Epics produce maximum economic benefit
In SAFe WSJF estimated Cost Delay CoD divided job size
ARTs provide ongoing continuous flow work make Enterprise incremental development effort
It avoids overhead delay caused nature traditional project authorization phase gate control program economics
While continuous flow model speed delivery value keep system Lean priority must updated continuously provide best economic outcome
In system job sequencing rather theoretical individual job return investment produce best result
To end WSJF used prioritize backlog calculating relative CoD job size proxy duration
Using WSJF boundary continuously update backlog priority based user business value time factor risk opportunity enablement effort
WSJF also conveniently automatically ignores sunk cost fundamental principle Lean economics
Reinertsen describes comprehensive model called weighted shortest job first prioritizing job based economics product development flow
Calculate WSJF dividing CoD duration
Jobs deliver value CoD shortest length selected first implementation
When applied SAFe model support additional principle product development flow including Figure show impact correctly applying WSJF see full discussion
The area shaded blue illustrate total CoD case
Doing weighted shortest job first delivers best economics
In SAFe job develop need establish Cost Delay duration
Three primary element contribute Cost Delay Moreover since continuous flow large enough backlog choose worry absolute number
We compare backlog item relative using modified Fibonacci number use estimating Then relative CoD calculated follows Next need understand job duration
That pretty difficult determine especially early might know going work capacity allocation team
Fortunately ready proxy job size
In system fixed resource job size good proxy duration
If I one mowing lawn front yard three time bigger backyard going take three time longer And know estimate item size Story point already see
Taking job size reasonably straightforward calculation comparing job via WSJF Figure illustrates
Then example create simple table compare job three job case shown Figure
To use table Figure team rate Feature relative others three parameter
Note With relative estimating look one column time set smallest item one set others relative
Then divide CoD job size
The job highest WSJF next important item
This model encourages splitting large item multiple smaller one compete smaller item
But Agile work
Since implementation incremental whenever continuing job rank well peer likely satisfied particular requirement sufficiently move next one
As described another advantage model necessary determine absolute value number
Instead need rate parameter item item backlog
Finally backlog estimate include remaining job size frequent reprioritization mean system automatically ignore sunk cost
Job size always make good proxy
For example But rarely need worry edge case small error selection next important job make way soon enough

It make perfect sense
Right try tends wheel fall
To use formula need value variable thing get tricky
Determining cost delay extremely tricky especially project
A large retailer like Target Walmart McDonald might able tell cost delay opening store
Given enough existing store know average price demographic data population income data distance competing store nuanced data analyst might able calculate sale profit potential store
All relies law large data set large enough average meaningful
Which brings second problem
If fund valuable project second valuable third valuable eventually find conflict
We enough people project four enough DBAs
We could project seven list mean lower value job staffing issue
One solution identify multiskilled people build implementation team optimal combination skill
In experience little bit much like
When want start next block project need people eight available start two part time At point I would warn make tool Joshua bit advice
That plan WSJF saving
Instead experiment least trying make explicit along modern technique like stable team optimizing delivery building quality along way

Weighted Shortest Job First available

If already account sign second
HI Weighted Shortest Job First WSJF technique backlog prioritization recommended Dean Leffingwell
The calculation involves measure User Value Time Value Risk Reduction Opportunity Enablement Value Job Size WSJF User Value Time Value RROE Value Job Size User Value Time Value RROE Value meant number
I looking worked example
In particular I would like see value assigned variable numerator Job Size measured
Is relative sizing approach taken value absolute
Thanks Ian Check article
It probably give looking Ian Check article let know think Hi Brad I suspect using WSJF order Product Backlog may invite vanity metric
The question variable populated unbiased credible manner
The article linked thanks
advantage least making thing democratic planning poker used agree value certain attribute hold
Yet clearly could still result prioritization persuasion
In Scrum forecast applied Development Team smallest batch possible Sprint Backlog order contain estimation risk
I reckon WSJF contrasted objective method backlog management innovation accounting whereby Product Backlog order informed actionable metric derived test release MVP
As approach exploratory development Scrum build assumption use small increment prove disprove hypothesis make adjustment based result
Values assigned User Value Time Value RROE Value Job Size based real metric
They also adjusted strategic driver change something happens change Product Backlog Items
In word give value date
Just every Product Backlog Item Product Backlog appreciable amount time constantly prioritised reconsidered entirety
In word give value date Yes would sensible
The value measure given PBI suddenly disappear measure unaddressed validated learning cycle
Rather subject gradual decay
Hi Ian I expert SAFe based literature value management structure formula using relative Job Size OK something like story point
Generally value simply proportional benefit cost ratio
In case involve procurement cost human resource le level salary easily replace cost job size
If assume number people usually work item even replace job size duration
There thing formula I comfortable
Risk considered numerator benefit risk potential affect benefit cost
risk may cause spend three time effort item

There risk double counting benefit three element Value Time Criticality independent

There issue suggested way normalizing SAFe assigning item lowest state column practically impact weight criterion
For example item generally time critical project importance automatically reduces formula right
The main problem simply use relative value linear normalization method long dividing multiplying formula adding
Anyway I still bigger problem formula
When difficult measure something people usually break calculation smaller piece try
Sometimes right way fooling
In case measuring value item project probably enough simply assign relative intuitive amount benefit divide size get value
Some people comfortable subjective
However detailed formula still subjective room bias worst creates illusion precision always dangerous
I think also important reminder exercise like flaw meant absolute replacement intuition data point may
In case way empirically know made right decision made executed point value decay time acted need revisited
If feeling particularly uneasy decision hand cook two matrix granular articulation exercised independently see conflict
I used WSJF extensively number company context
I found I needed adapt slightly specific context
For example one company I built scale BV point return per calendar month point return
Can also use scale TC
Found RROE le easy build subjective scale
Currently working national healthcare I cover front line patient care service I found measuring value challenging
In case I used tool called VMOST help organise product vision mission objective strategy tactic measured value BV tactic feature move objective mission
That seems work well
The bottom line WSJF force right conversation really ass value cost delay whilst also understanding date need hit risk need reducing feature would enable future BV
The benefit size divisor
When I publish backlog I usually put CoD score right next WSJF score even heat mapping
I force conversation around big valuable stuff languishing bottom list damn big decompose value batch size smaller unit release value faster
WSJF really worked become standard mode backlog sequencing many company I involved
Can gamed yes backed set measurable objective scale reduce amount gaming

Weighted shortest job first WSJF agile backlog prioritization technique seems easy enough surface
It mean valuable thing first relative value equal pure value divided size job
The wheel fall idea actually try
To actually implement WSJF determine type weight first build economic model calculate weight effort job finally build spreadsheet
The spreadsheet half actual selection portfolio work us spreadsheet input final result
Let get started
WSJF strategy prioritizing implementation product feature according numerical value importance calculated stakeholder divided effort length job
There many different way calculate weighting effort common method
If cost delay variable consider view entire value project time window
The higher level planning longer window
We typically recommend window portfolio level
A third style weighting
These number balance three factor tied actual dollar amount
Generally speaking weight tied revenue impact right graph lead better decision
At time require effort information available
The challenge pick weight trade effort reward
Source At portfolio level job potential investment company make
That could include new product initiative keeping light new infrastructure
The key issue job Core consideration number key driver project
Examples could include While strictly part WSJF come back core consideration later
Once picked weighting method need find value project using method
That mean gathering data
If weighting method cost delay need find dollar value cost delay
To find dollar value given project The economic model also include generally measured also measured pure month
The key pick number allows accurate decision company
The cost service support physical server cloud service also part economic model
Now hard part assigning numerical value value job
For large enough organization ideal model single portfolio manager guardian spreadsheet gather number prospective business sponsor
Time horizon work well since sponsor held prediction fact
This work SAFe competing business leader tempted inflate score without consequence
Instead single vote need consensus least average represents
In case able get number might mean going back choosing different economic model
In general start far right side BackLog Prioritization graph move left data available
The basic formula WSJF value divided job size Now figure denominator
The job size determined economic modeling portion simply involve honing estimate project
Having sponsor provide number realistic option long feedback time
Once company completes first project decided WSJF circle back see predicted duration match actual duration
The great thing math even estimate long generally equal amount example project projected percent actual effort number average
The main challenge probably widely varying project size
In book Don Reinertsen suggests larger project tend later overly optimistic increasing percentage average
A larger percentage larger project mean much larger schedule slip track schedule slip carefully
The best way manage risk manage project appropriate level
A portfolio dealing wildly project may simply defer resource perhaps percent small project bucket work WSJF portfolio else break larger project smaller size
Your spreadsheet six column Project name sponsor core consideration weight job size first five
The sixth column weighted value calculated weight divided job size
Add column sort spreadsheet valuable project first WSJF spreadsheet
That enough organize entire IT department good start
Troy Magennis principal consultant Focused Objective created template WSJF released creative common
Both Joe Vallone Adam Yuret quick suggest weakness single spreadsheet preferring balanced approach multiple metric
If possible create different spreadsheet different weighting
If WSJF try get actual revenue prediction
Or try pure cost delay divided duration looking long project take many people need
A full detailed analysis would consider many different factor would available project
This look like war room multiple spreadsheet data poster board room
For time try create two different spreadsheet
The comparison two number may create exception
Once spreadsheet done time dig detail
The top two project might add percent company
Or might require skill meaning IT department might enough people skill
The project might require outside contractor additional training
The company might need replace existing system declining revenue need diversify
An infrastructure project appears might required enable future project higher return think cascading cost Once spreadsheet done picking actual project little bit like putting puzzle piece together
It time come back core consideration get core decision maker room come consensus
The process one done either think narrowing uncertainty time
Implementing ideal portfolio likely challenge existing project flight
Most organization I meet scheduled paper running percent percent capacity already work planned future
Shifting WSJF mean waiting project finish plugging best project fill gap
That might top spreadsheet due intangible staffing
Once first project funded congratulation real work begin
Now need continually monitor list adding new job deleting bad idea updating weight job size new information becomes available
As project end fund next project make sense monitoring see implementation delivering better outcome whatever process used

Shortest Job First way maximising return investment software team
There two ingredient required WSJF job job
The weighting Don specifically recommends product development

The part short job
What need know How long job block pipeline For need forecast job
This matter blocking work started
During time incurring
What Don specifically proposes specific form Weighted Shortest Job First
There possible form WSJF Weighted Shortest Job First depending trying optimise
You could choose weight technical risk market risk stakeholder influence length time waiting factor combination might want maximise
For organisation though interested maximising economic return
In case Cost Delay weight
Saying Weighted Shortest Job First specifically Cost Delay Divided Duration time get rather tiring ease communication shorten least case weighting
This also benefit communicating important component algorithm Cost Delay
When using priority order feature project determined dividing estimated Cost Delay estimated duration higher resulting score higher priority
One benefit version WSJF enables u use compare opportunity different value urgency well take account situation duration differs
optimises return investment minimising total Delay Cost incurred given set potential option
In product development setting capacity relatively inflexible difficult scale
This mean understanding long pipeline blocked often quite valuable information
Because us Duration denominator also benefit encouraging breakdown work smaller batch
Breaking work one easiest effective improvement make term getting value faster flow better quality
Let take look example help u understand improves Return Investment
Consider following three feature consider outcome two alternative scheduling approach
We could choose work deliver feature one time order arrived
A B This called First In First Out FIFO
It common scheduling approach manufacturing
After person asking Feature A waiting longest time could make sense u serve first
Then move B For week working Feature A incur Cost Delay three feature
This add week giving u Delay Cost incurred
Once delivered Feature A move developing Feature B
For week take u deliver incur Cost Delay Features B C week additional bringing u total worth Delay Cost incurred
Finally start working Feature C incurring Cost Delay C development two week take build Feature So another Delay Cost add previous total Delay Cost incurred
Let consider another way processing Features
If develop feature based whichever highest score would Feature B first followed Feature C finally Feature A
For week working Feature B incur Cost Delay
Delay Cost week For following week working Feature C incur Cost Delay
Delay Cost For week working Feature A incur Cost Delay
Delay Cost Total Delay Cost using Using FIFO resulted total Delay Cost
Using gave u total Delay cost decrease Delay Cost incurred
As see using version Weighted Shortest Job First order backlog make quite big difference
What simple comparison show though human effect giving preference work smaller impact flow
As shown using also encourages breaking batch way influencing priority
This mean instead rewarding larger batch often claim higher benefit case encouraging people minimise size thing ask
This huge benefit number area least significantly faster well better throughput thanks reduced variability work item processed
It great endorsement WSJF Dean Leffingwell S recommends using prioritisation
SAFe also emphasis WSJF applied feature level also match
One damaging concept ever take hold organisation
SAFe commended encouraging organisation along area
Having said current teaching WSJF SAFe leaf plenty room improvement particular
In attempt Cost Delay SAFe may unintentionally made complicated rendered useless much value Cost Delay bring

Long I put pixel screen shared view
My main plea would make sure boil Cost Delay simply better way prioritise much
I since proposed could used WSJF
Based I also proposed make least coherent reflective underlying concept
A great write I completely agree value driving best business decision obviously improvement FiFo approach commonly adopted IT domain
I confused business follow approach though
think lack exposure SAFe go way address slight head considering value work cultural change around smaller work package
many organisation bundle together work give largest ROI number approach well described simplified
Thanks putting simple

March How decide going drink first
Deciding piece work done first vexing question organization
Every organization find set tool help sift portfolio possible project
In organization without form central portfolio control department team may set criterion decide job first
Techniques prioritization I seen action range squeaky wheel highly detailed analysis
One method I initially exposed SAFe training weighted shortest job first WSJF
WSJF begin cost delay
CoD method placing value waste inherent delay
There number factor often included cost delay
These include wait time inventory cost opportunity cost
Once CoD estimated time complete work also known duration used weighting mechanism differentiate project
book provided example showed cost delay two job shortest job first
One way conceptualize shortest job first would avoid least cost delay deliver value sooner
Here example CoD per day Time Complete Work Item Days Work Item Days Work Item Days Doing work item shortest longest would mean cost delay item one CoD day X item CoD day day X
A total CoD would incurred
Compare earliest job first work opposite order longest shortest
Work Item Zero CoD Accrued Work Item CoD day x Work Item CoD day day x CoD versus


I know order I would choose
Obviously thing typically messier estimate CoD time complete
SAFe us complete attribute weighting factor identify weighted smallest job done first
The calculation weighted shortest job first WSJF
Her example CoD per day Time Complete Weight Work Item Days Work Item Days Work Item day The order completion would work item work item
The total CoD accrued would
Prioritization difficult result number technique approach prioritization
WSJF allows prioritize unit work using lean concept cost delay complete giving consistent economic framework
Consistency repeatability mean logic fairness drive work done order
Without framework often squeaky wheel get grease know squeaky deliver value
recent discussion concept Cost Delay CoD Weighted Short Job First WSJF used table mathematical formula led discussion accuracy precision
The While might argue better approach might approach prioritization using weighted shortest job first approach maximize value delivered important message chapter shift focus step

I question Priority based preemptive Shortest Job First algorithm
If two process priority one go first
The one put first one smaller burst time
Same go burst time I process burst time I sort priority
And happens process burst time priority
For example would Gantt chart based table look like
As name implies first pick set highest priority job
Then set select shortest job
In case I presume time represents expected execution time time yield
Therefore assuming lower priority number represent priority job two highest priority job
At point matter expected job size burst time point select one shortest burst time
In case would

You probably noticed Algorithm paper graph
In case amount BFS shortest path vertex v found immediately v first encountered represented
This property due search feature BFS
If node first occurrence check
However check
For graph property mentioned necessarily hold
So need meaning following needed predicate slightly involved one suitable graph Note graph use priority queue
If greater I delete previous update like others
No
You set shortest path found

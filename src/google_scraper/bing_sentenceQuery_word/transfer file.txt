A recording discretely
Just word written paper information written computer file
There different designed different purpose
A file may designed store picture written message wide variety kind data
Some type file store several type information
By using computer program person open read change close computer file
Computer file may reopened modified copied arbitrary number time
Typically computer file organised keep track file enables people access
The word file derives Latin thread
File used publicly context computer storage early February In RCA advertisement describing new memory vacuum tube developed RCA stated result countless computation kept file taken
Such exists tube developed RCA Laboratories
Electronically retains figure fed calculating machine hold storage memorizes new one speed intelligent solution maze mathematics
In file denoted information stored
In early use underlying hardware rather content stored denominated file
For example disk drive denominated disk file
The introduction circa MIT concept managed several virtual file one storage device origin contemporary denotation word
Although contemporary demonstrates early concept file use greatly decreased
On modern file organized array
The file defined content since file solely container data although platform format usually indicated specifying rule byte must organized interpreted meaningfully
For example byte plain text file Windows associated either character byte image video audio file interpreted otherwise
Most file type also allocate byte allows file carry basic information
Some file system store arbitrary interpreted file system data outside file format linked file example
On file system done via database
All method however susceptible loss metadata format
At instant time file might size normally expressed number indicates much storage associated file
In modern operating system size whole number byte system limit
Many older operating system kept track number occupied file physical storage device
In system software employed method track exact byte count used special control character signal end text file
The general definition file require size real meaning however unless data within file happens correspond data within pool persistent storage
A special case file newly created file yet data written may serve kind file system accident result aborted disk operation
For example file link point typical system probably defined size seldom change
Compare also file size may obscure
This misleading really file system resource including device accessed like file still real distinction file core behave obscurity size one manifestation
As character device size
Information computer file consist smaller packet information often called line individually different share common trait
For example payroll file might contain information concerning employee company payroll detail record payroll file concern one employee record common trait related similar placing payroll information specific filing cabinet office computer
A text file may contain line text corresponding printed line piece paper
Alternatively file may contain arbitrary binary image may contain
The way information grouped file entirely designed
This led plethora le standardized file structure imaginable purpose simplest complex
Most computer file used create modify delete file use basis
The programmer create program decide file needed used often name
In case computer program manipulate file made visible computer user
For example user manipulates document file user personally name
Although content document file arranged format program understands user able choose name location file provide bulk information word text stored file
Many application pack data file single file called using internal marker discern different type information contained within
The benefit archive file lower number file easier transfer reduce storage usage organize outdated file
The archive file must often unpacked next using
The basic operation program perform file Files computer created moved modified grown shrunk deleted
In case computer program executed computer handle operation user computer also manipulate file necessary
For instance file normally created modified Microsoft Word program response user command user also move file directly using Windows computer CLI
In system program operate directly low level file
Only kernel deal file handle interaction file manner transparent program
The provides level mean interaction file simply filename instead
For example delete file file
There many link file removed considers file memory space free reallocated
This commonly considered security risk due existence
Any program us system function wipe file data
In modern computer system file typically accessed using name
In operating system name associated file
In others file anonymous pointed link name
In latter case user identify name link file false analogue especially exists one link file
Files link file located directory
However generally contain either list file list link file
Within definition paramount importance term file includes directory
This permit existence directory hierarchy directory containing
A name refers file within directory must typically unique
In word must identical name within directory
However operating system name may include specification type mean directory contain identical name one type object directory file
In environment file named file name path file directory must uniquely identify among file computer two file name path
Where file anonymous named reference exist within namespace
In case name within namespace refer exactly zero one file
However file may represented within namespace zero one name
Any string character may may name file link depending upon context application
Whether name depends type computer system used
Early computer permitted letter digit name file modern computer allow long name character containing almost combination letter unicode digit making easier understand purpose file glance
Some computer system allow file name contain space others
file name determined
Unix file system usually case sensitive allow application create file whose name differ case character
support multiple file system different policy regarding
The common file system multiple file whose name differ case user us edit file name
User application however usually allow user create multiple file name differing case
Most computer organize file hierarchy using folder directory catalog
The concept irrespective terminology used
Each folder contain arbitrary number file also contain folder
These folder referred subfolders
Subfolders contain still file folder thus building structure one master folder root folder name varies one operating system another contain number level folder file
Folders named file except root folder often name
The use folder make easier organize file logical way
When computer allows use folder file folder name also path identifies folder folder file folder resides
In path sort special used separate file folder name
For example illustration shown article path uniquely identifies file called folder called turn contained folder called
The folder file name separated slash example topmost root folder name path begin slash root folder name would precede first slash
Many computer system use file name help identify contain also known file type
On Windows computer extension consist dot period end file name followed letter identify type file
An extension identifies text file extension identifies type document documentation commonly
Even extension used computer system degree computer system recognizes heed vary system required system completely ignored presented
Many modern computer system provide method protecting file accidental deliberate damage
Computers allow multiple user implement control may may modify delete create file folder
For example given user may granted permission read file folder modify delete user may given permission read modify file folder execute
Permissions may also used allow certain user see content file folder
Permissions protect unauthorized tampering destruction information file keep private information confidential unauthorized user
Another protection mechanism implemented many computer When flag turned file accomplished computer program human user file examined modified
This flag useful critical information must modified erased special file used internal part computer system
Some system also include make certain file invisible flag used computer system hide essential system file user alter
Any file useful purpose must physical manifestation
That file abstract concept real computer system must real physical analogue exist
In physical term computer file stored type data storage device
For example store file
Hard disk ubiquitous form storage since early
Where file contain temporary information may stored
Computer file also stored medium case etc
The use also beginning rival hard disk drive
In operating system many file associated physical storage device
Examples file directory
These virtual file exist object within operating system kernel
As seen running user program file usually represented either
A File control block FCB area memory manipulated establish filename
passed operating system parameter used older IBM operating system early PC operating system including early version
A file handle generally either integer introduced around running ubiquitous
When computer file contain information extremely important process used protect disaster might destroy file
Backing file simply mean making copy file separate location restored something happens computer deleted accidentally
There many way back file
Most computer system provide utility program assist process become many file safeguard
Files often copied removable medium writable CDs cartridge tape
Copying file another hard disk computer protects failure one disk necessary protect failure destruction entire computer copy file must made medium taken away computer stored safe distant location
The method automatically make three grandfather file oldest copy file son current copy
The way computer organizes name store manipulates file globally referred Most computer least one file system
Some computer allow use several different file system
For instance newer MS Windows computer older file system old version Windows supported addition file system normal file system recent version Windows
Each system advantage disadvantage
Standard FAT allows file name plus extension space example whereas NTFS allows much longer name contain space
You call file NTFS FAT would restricted something like unless using FAT extension allowing long file name
program utility program allow user manipulate file directly
They allow move create delete rename file folder although actually allow read content file store information
Every computer system provides least one program native file system
For example File Explorer formerly Windows Explorer commonly used Microsoft Windows operating system Nautilus common several distribution Linux

From time time may need get one file department
This file transfer done different way secure
The recommended method transferring file either use encrypted mechanism one require enter username password
The preferred method use part suite program
SSH stand ecure ell obtained number place including site
Other alternative include
The rsync service requires contact assist setting rsync module choose either publish receive data
The FTP service also requires directory created point receive anonymous incoming data
For case large volume data need moved CS Department CS Staff manages Globus Data Transfer Node networking used schedule manage transfer datasets Globus DTNs
All CS account holder access CS Department DTN
To get started go click link
You prompted login using existing organizational login
In lookup box locate click
This redirect login using main campus credential
Once authenticated taken page
On page select two endpoint transfer
These Globus DTNs access either Princeton institution
To select endpoint click section search box pop start typing identifier try Princeton
The CS Department endpoint listed
Once select endpoint may prompted authenticate endpoint CS Department DTN
Use local credential authenticate DTN CS Department DTN use CS account credential see view file available transfer
Click bar provide different filesystem location
Follow step endpoint transfer select bottom page ready start transfer
For information please see Globus page
If trouble using CS DTN question please reach CS Staff assistance
scp program
sftp program
They similar BSD rcp ftp program except send everything including authentication credential encrypted channel preventing eavesdropper capturing username password using break account
Details using scp sftp unix linux MacOS X found man page
In general scp sftp used connect host able login ssh

rsync open source utility provides fast incremental file transfer
As service department neither encrypted strongly authenticated
However used publishing receiving data simple insecure password protection
The CS Department rsync service offer three main option publish module To see public module currently available server try command produce list available module To use view module simply drill deeper Before making extensive use rsync strongly recommend play around safe area become familiar eccentricity
Thorough documentation available rsync man page
The method getting file CS department use called prompted user name word used
Typically user email address used password private information real password revealed
There command line program available unix system
Alternatively use web browser specify ftp location URL In order use anonymous FTP copy file CS department outside need request set incoming FTP directory
The directory name user ID
From department unix machine access directory path USER
To access directory web browser go unix user name
To access directory traditional command line FTP client connect
To get file CS department using anonymous FTP machine outside department need access directory server
From web browser would use
From traditional command line FTP program would connect
Of course order somebody get file directory first need put somebody within CS department
You department unix machine copying file directory

FTP open protocol standard widely used transport receive large file
It also used send configuration file software update network switch router
FTP us port communication also us encryption protect information received sent
In lesson go topic familiar FTP offer
This image show generic operation client access FTP server
The FTP server listens Port connection request sends data Port
Let look process starting establishing FTP connection using Port FTP server
The FTP client open random port initiate request
In case FTP client chooses Port
The FTP client forward request FTP connection Port FTP server listening Port
Once FTP server receives FTP connection request Port FTP server send acknowledgment back FTP client using address Port saying connection established download may commence
At point connection established FTP client FTP server
The FTP server us Port connection setup receiving command FTP client
The next step downloading data FTP server FTP client
The FTP client send data request signal FTP server
In data request FTP client tell FTP server send data I want download
Use Port delivery address
Now FTP server know send data Port FTP client The FTP server open new port Port
Port solely used send data FTP client nothing
Now using Port FTP server send data client using client Port delivery address
Once download complete client tear connection download successful
So Port
Because standard server listen FTP request sending data
You configure server use different port number desired however client need know port number FTP request get processed correctly
If client request FTP access port FTP server listening request dropped
Here example
Everyone know call emergency
But happens police changed number something different told anyone
People would still call help police would know listening different number
People try call police keeping calling calling without aware phone number changed
This concept FTP port
FTP us two protocol sending receiving file Get FREE access day create account
FTP using provides assurance information sent complete FTP TCP try accomplish mission complete
This add overhead information sent slower using UDP protocol
FTP using provide error checking validation verify data sent correctly unlike TCP protocol
FTP using UDP protocol called Simple File Transfer Protocol SFTP
So would use SFTP
Because service allows fast transfer data verify validate information received client correctly
SFTP mostly used sending configuration file router switch
These file typically kilobyte size take little effort send
SFTP recommended requirement call downloading large file
So happens need send information securely
FTP us secure method transferring information called
This protocol used different application Transport Layer Security TLS application
Some virtual private network application use send information way needed
Most FTP application let use using encryption method
This type method us bulk encryption secure
So concern using FTP would like secure information use
FTP provides user valuable tool sending receiving file
It even help u manage network device router switch
We know FTP us protocol fast delivery guaranteed FTP us best effort delivery
We understand FTP client sends request Port server server sends data back client Port
FTP us encryption order prevent hacker stealing corrupting information

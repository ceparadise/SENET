Exploring Computer Science yearlong course
The course developed around framework computer science content computational practice
Assignments instruction contextualized socially relevant meaningful diverse student
The curriculum utilizes variety culminate final project around following topic Ethical social issue computing career computing woven throughout six unit
Throughout course placed computing enables innovation variety field impact innovation society
Computing situated within economic social cultural context therefore influence influenced
The proliferation computer network raise number ethical issue
Technology positive negative impact human culture
Students able identify ethical behavior articulate side ethical topic
Students study responsibility software user software developer respect intellectual property right software failure piracy software digital medium
They introduced concept software development explore implication
Students identify describe career computing career employ computing
Appropriate grade
This course designed UCLA serf introduction Computer Science course like AP Computer Science Principles AP Computer Science Programming

Learn curriculum professional development program teacher community
Learn research effective practice broadening participation computing
ECS project team primarily funded National Science Foundation housed UCLA University Oregon
Our work focus following three strand We seek develop teacher confidence course content includes yet accessible computing concept
Our curriculum involve many opportunity collaboration abstract thinking
We seek provide meaningful educational opportunity teacher student typically encounter barrier access
We currently working ironing detail summer professional development program
done recent year update set thing stone
We understand value ease implementation work step way

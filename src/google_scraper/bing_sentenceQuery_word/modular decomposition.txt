Decomposition Structure Negative Context Static Dynamic Requirements Models Systems Partition Functions Use Scenarios Mapping Requirements Goals A decomposition diagram show function process organization data subject area type object broken lower level detailed component
For example decomposition diagram may represent organizational structure functional decomposition process
Decomposition diagram provide logical hierarchical decomposition system

In decomposition subset vertex called A module generalization graph
Unlike connected component however one module proper subset another
Modules therefore lead recursive hierarchical decomposition graph instead partition
There variant modular decomposition
For undirected graph decomposition unique
This notion generalized structure example directed graph useful design efficient algorithm recognition graph class finding transitive orientation graph
As notion module rediscovered many area also called
Perhaps earliest reference first description modular quotient graph decomposition give rise appeared
A graph generalization
A connected component property set vertex every member every vertex
It union connected component property
More generally module vertex either every member every member neighbor
Equivalently module member set neighbor among vertex
Contrary connected component module graph module module nested one module proper subset another
Note set vertex graph module subset empty set called
A graph may may module
A graph called module trivial
Despite difference module preserve desirable property connected component many property subgraph connected component independent rest graph
A similar phenomenon also applies subgraphs induced module
The module graph therefore great algorithmic interest
A set nested module modular decomposition example used guide recursive solution many combinatorial problem graph recognizing transitively orienting recognizing finding permutation representation recognizing whether graph finding certificate answer question recognizing finding interval representation defining Spinrad Papadoupoulos
They play important role Lovász celebrated proof Golumbic
For recognizing graph generalization modular decomposition called especially useful Spinrad
To avoid possibility ambiguity definition give following formal definition module

either adjacent adjacent

module called
A graph module trivial
graph complement graph also module
graph overlap module module either
If disjoint module easy see either every member neighbor every element member adjacent member
Thus relationship two disjoint module either
No relationship intermediate two extreme exist
Because partition class module particular interest
Suppose modular partition
Since partition class disjoint adjacency constitute new graph whose vertex member
That vertex module G adjacency module edge
In figure vertex vertex vertex vertex vertex modular partition
In upper right diagram edge set depict quotient given partition edge internal set depict corresponding factor
The partition
graph Suppose nontrivial module
Then subset nontrivial modular partition
Thus existence nontrivial module implies existence nontrivial modular partition
In general many member nontrivial module
If nontrivial modular partition compact representation edge endpoint different partition class
For partition class subgraph induced called give representation edge endpoint
Therefore edge reconstructed given quotient graph factor
The term graph come fact prime graph trivial quotient factor
When factor modular quotient possible recursively decomposed factor quotient
Each level recursion give rise quotient
As base case graph one vertex
Collectively reconstructed inductively reconstructing factor bottom inverting step decomposition combining factor quotient level
In figure recursive decomposition represented tree depicts one way recursively decomposing factor initial modular partition smaller modular partition
A way recursively decompose graph factor quotient may unique
For example subset vertex complete graph module mean many different way decomposing recursively
Some way may useful others
Fortunately exists recursive decomposition graph implicitly represents way decomposing modular decomposition
It way decomposing graph recursively quotient subsumes others
The decomposition depicted figure special decomposition given graph
The following key observation understanding modular decomposition module module
In Gallai Gallai defined modular decomposition recursively graph vertex set follows The final tree set vertex leaf due base case
A set vertex module node tree union child series parallel node
This implicitly give modular partition
It sense modular decomposition tree subsumes way recursively decomposing quotient
A data structure representing modular decomposition tree support operation input node return set vertex G node represents
An obvious way assign node list vertex represents
Given pointer node structure could return set vertex represents time
However data structure would require space worst case
An alternative match performance obtained representing modular decomposition tree using standard data structure labeling leaf vertex represents
The set represented internal node given set label leaf descendant
It well known rooted tree leaf internal node
One use search starting report label time
Each node set vertex internal node set child partition partition class module
They therefore induce quotient
The vertex quotient element represented installing edge among child
If two member adjacent adjacent quotient
For pair vertex determined quotient child least common ancestor modular decomposition tree
Therefore modular decomposition labeled way quotient give complete representation
Many combinatorial problem solved solving problem separately quotient
For example comparability graph quotient comparability graph Gallai Möhring
Therefore find whether graph comparability graph one need find whether quotient
In fact find comparability graph suffices transitively orient quotient modular decomposition Gallai Möhring
A similar phenomenon applies permutation graph McConnell Spinrad interval graph Hsu Ma perfect graph graph class
Some important combinatorial optimization problem graph solved using similar strategy Möhring

I trying understand concept graph
In On graph proof solve optimization problem like using Modular decomposition
Solving problem composing using disjoint sum disjoint union two graph easy know answer
Since decomposition graph bounded graph
etc
easy solve base case solve composition
Hence using decomposition tree possible solve problem linear time
But seems technique would work graph class bounded
Then I found Linear Time Solvable Optimization Problems Graphs Bounded Clique Width seems make generalization I looking I could understand well
Is equivalent say decomposition tree bounded like graph case say graph property bounded
In case answer NO Does exists result class graph bounded like graph thus optimization problem like solvable linear time class

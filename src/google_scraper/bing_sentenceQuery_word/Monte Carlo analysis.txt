That meaning instability
But lot problem
To process natural mineral enrich Plutonium painful process
It like carve entire mountain material spending enormous quantity energy get milligram enriched Plutonium
How much precious Plutonium enough
How could use
It inoffensive release power one atom
In order create bomb need create chain reaction one atom release energy break another atom another domino effect
It like fire
With gasoline fire extinguish produce chain reaction burn forest
The sub critical reaction bomb explode chain reaction happen
It like domino chain interrupted along way
The super critical reaction bomb explodes exponential amount energy released
The mission scientist find condition critical reaction line exploding
The knowledge critical condition two main goal need assured bomb would explode also needed sure explode hand
They divide amount Plutonium little piece little enough explode want even accident happens
And join little piece one single great piece enough material cause chain reaction wanted moment explosion
How calculate bomb explode

Is good choice
No unless know exactly
He overfitting model
Because want model past
We want model
And future necessarily fit complicated weibull
I prefer humble say I know exactly
The way say I know exactly use simple random variable normal uniform
Once know random variable use Monte Carlo method
It consists throwing dice random variable

What Monte Carlo method
In general term Monte Carlo method Monte Carlo simulation used describe technique approximates solution quantitative problem statistical sampling
As used Carlo simulation specifically used describe method propagating translating uncertainty model input uncertainty model output result
Hence type simulation explicitly quantitatively represents uncertainty
Monte Carlo simulation relies process explicitly representing uncertainty specifying input
If input describing system uncertain prediction future performance necessarily uncertain
That result analysis based input represented probability distribution probability distribution
Whereas result single simulation uncertain system build dam salmon population could go extinct result probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation build dam chance salmon population go extinct
Such result case quantifying risk extinction typically much useful utilize simulation result
In order compute probability distribution predicted performance necessary translate input uncertainty uncertainty result
A variety method exist propagating uncertainty
Monte Carlo simulation perhaps common technique propagating uncertainty various aspect system predicted performance
In Monte Carlo simulation entire system simulated large number time
Each simulation equally likely referred system
For realization uncertain parameter sampled single random value selected specified distribution describing parameter
The system simulated time given particular set input parameter performance system computed
This result large number separate independent result representing possible future system one possible path system may follow time
The result independent system realization assembled probability distribution possible outcome
As result output single value probability distribution
As simple example Monte Carlo simulation consider calculating probability particular sum throw two dice die value one six
In particular case combination dice roll Based manually compute probability particular outcome
For example six different way dice could sum seven
Hence probability rolling seven equal divided
Instead computing probability way however could instead throw dice hundred time record many time outcome occurs
If dice totaled seven time roll would conclude probability rolling seven approximately
Obviously time rolled dice le approximate result would
Better rolling dice hundred time easily use computer simulate rolling dice time
Because know probability particular outcome one die six number simple
The output realization using GoldSim software The accuracy Monte Carlo simulation function number realization
That confidence bound result readily computed based number realization
The two example show confidence bound value outcome chance true value lie bound Monte Carlo simulation named city Monaco famous casino game chance roulette involve repetitive event known probability
Although number isolated undeveloped application Monte Carlo simulation principle earlier date modern application Monte Carlo method date work atomic bomb
Mathematician Stanislaw Ulam credited recognizing computer could make Monte Carlo simulation complex system feasible GoldSim powerful flexible probabilistic simulation platform dynamically simulating nearly kind physical financial organizational system
You build model intuitive manner literally drawing picture influence diagram system
GoldSim flexible easy use Monte Carlo simulation tool allowing represent uncertainty propagating translating uncertainty model input uncertainty model output result
Although GoldSim used static real power also allowing evaluate system evolve time predict future behavior
As GoldSim powerful feature representing process rainfall demand random event accident failure

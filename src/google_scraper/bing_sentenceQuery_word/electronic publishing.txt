Available Key word electronic publishing electronic journal online journal digital publication communication information management Electronic mail compact disc read memory electronic journal online journal common everyday term originated
The purpose article provide overview electronic publishing describe information increasingly exchanged within scientific community discus scholarly qualification electronic venue
First discus meant electronic publishing second give example usage type electronic publishing
Third examine electronic publishing particularly used nursing health care
Fourth discus advantage disadvantage electronic journal fifth discus advantage disadvantage print journal
We end look century project electronic journal maybe used nurse future
Electronic publishing broadly defined material produced digitally
Electronic publishing encompassing term variety digitally produced material bulletin board newsgroups mailing list based medium website
Material produced electronically classified two major category mutually exclusive communication information management
website often categorized information management others like mailing list grouped mean communication
The differentiation often lie whether central purpose sending message communication knowledge resource information management
CDs example may store information data book encyclopedia
An increasing number nursing textbook include CD buyer included CD supplemental text material
In like manner CDs information stored web site
However instead computer reading CD computer read information kept website
The example information stored American Nurses Association website Nursingworld bulletin board newsgroups mailing list used convey message carry discussion
These type medium require interactivity another person either real time synchronous asynchronously person connected
In synchronous communication used chat room teleconferencing exchange immediate talking phone
Asynchronous communication common synchronous implies delayed reading writing posting message like answering machine store message
Electronic publishing matter form broadcasted distributed disseminated digitally computer
However important distinction note electronic publication scholarly
Rather electronic publication include opinion view discussion type information meet criterion scholarship
Scholarship broadest sense implies certain criterion met goal clearly stated background preparation sufficient approach appropriate important conclusion made presentation material effective project thoughtfully evaluated
Messaging networking two mean using electronic publication communication
Messaging one widely established way communicate allows one person correspond writing
Networking allows message sent discussion occur among people case among thousand people
As messaging networking use type application briefly reviewed first
For novice user seeking information click following link
likened letter note writing
However instead mailing written copy carrier postal service leaving message someone desk electronically published computer
While simply written message file file sent along
These attachment contain picture video audio long text database file like protocol article research data
Because distributed widely digital considered electronic publication
Although like letter obviously considered scholarly type communication facilitate scholarship example many clinical research expert use among colleague exchange idea information reflection
Networking contrast implies wider list recipient broader array communication technique often ongoing communication process
Most often networking based mutual interest
It involves broadcasting interacting similar background like nurse teen hobbyist
Common method networking mailing list usenet news group forum
The frequency use whether announcement discussion depends purpose list often range day month
Mailing list used two major purpose send announcement wide audience interactive discussion among group subscribed member interested specific topic field
Both based
The announcement type mailing list frequently used vast number organization throughout world send information need distributed widely quickly efficiently
These message sent Internet Intranet computer system within organization networking computer set similarly internet use employee
See definition list term
Some example message common certainly exhaustive mailing list include homework assignment public service announcement road closing meeting time agenda conference information news joke
mailing list allow subscriber member signed participate send receive message identified purpose discussion group
This type communication sometimes called listerv reflecting one early software program used discussion
These discussion group list reviewed sent moderated sent immediately subscriber without review unmoderated
One largest mailing list service
Newsgroups similar mailing list previously discussed differ message accessed organization messaging
The news message sent
This type messaging developed University North Carolina year ago
basis newsgroup forum
Special software may part browser computer necessary access discussion
Newsgroups hierarchically organized category interest science sci computer comp social issue soc may nationally internationally regionally locally distributed
See complete example list news group specific nursing
Forums chat room also mean communication
They web based often developed sustained organization constituent
Forums like newsgroups message often threaded organized theme
Forums also like mailing list newsgroups asynchronous exchanging information different time
Chat room exploded commercial sector allow real time synchronous text posting primarily used socializing commercial purpose book promotion
The second way computer used electronic publishing manage information
Through computer software like connection website computer store information serve channel accessing information
Some form electronic publishing available computer include encyclopedia book magazine journal
Just short year ago many medium available hard copy library almost always peer reviewed
However computer become accessible capacity expanded type amount electronic publication multiplied astronomically
This explosion material increased knowledge access people explosion raised question related information management
Some issue consider pertain searching publishing evaluating maintaining plethora information computer based
Dewar state process preserving updating disseminating knowledge changed public scholar come expect immediately available instant feedback electronic publishing Therefore discipline professional must determine specific criterion scholarly publishing use general make electronic publishing
Nurses must individually collectively examine use epublishing manner evaluated
Just electronic publishing transforming communication information management public professional sector profession nursing using instance leading way electronic publishing
There however difference us number many application range basic complex
Let u expand everyday example convey variety us application
Most hospital using computer purchasing year increasingly nurse use computer document care extent use documentation much le purchasing
Some nurse visit web site learn patient education nurse fewer set web site provide patient education
Nurses also beginning use information management communication scholarship
Some nurse researcher used electronic publishing access database like CINAHL conducting literature review others used electronic publishing gather survey data
This data typically gathered sending electronic questionnaire making electronic questionnaire available website
Publication electronic journal online journal nursing also increased steadily
However uniformity format content scholarly nature
Murray Anthony describe continuum electronic journal paper content transferred print journal web paper content content electronic format paper version fully interactive involves hypermedia animated graphic sound moving image
The diverse content contained electronic journal may include scholarly article article reader response article editorial book review advertisement job opportunity continuing education offering data set preview research progress
Although electronic journal currently vary scholarly review process article reason accepted process peer review used print journal used online journal
Despite variability associated electronic publication advantage disadvantage generally apply electronic journal
Advantages electronic journal include accessibility usability increased communication collaboration author reader dissemination technologic capability facilitation scholarly work cost
Electronic journal accessible user regardless geographic location
Anyone world service proper computer software browser service access online journal
This accessibility lead diverse audience throughout world well readership may include academic student lay people
The electronic medium allows translation article language using software

Due universal accessibility electronic journal proper equipment service used regardless location
The reader required library specific place specific journal located
In addition reader posse read entire journal article
Electronic journal article particularly easy use journal issue unbundled specific file identified retrieved
Within specific file journal article easy reader read piece
Content electronic journal easily transmitted others reproduced
Ease searchability content often cited advantage electronic publication however searchability varies considerably different electronic publication time
The potential increased collaboration author reader increase electronic journal move along continuum paper content transferred web fully interactive journal
The electronic medium allows opportunity debate discussion either posting interchange reader author well reviewer related specific article hosting listservs chatroom including datasets available
These discussion ongoing restricted letter editor response
Increased communication collaboration also result lack space time constraint journal
Since usually page limitation electronic journal author reader free express thought thoroughly time frame may convenient individual
The accessibility associated online journal result increased diversity frequency communication much larger audience print journal well potential interdisciplinary collaboration
A major advantage online journal immediacy dissemination review article production distribution article
Things possible print journal among best feature online journal
Electronic journal provide animation virtual reality interactive display forward reference linked comment reply navigational aid internal hyperlink text corresponding table figure bibliographic reference
At present time multimedia capability often limited user equipment service
The greatest facilitator scholarly work ready quick access scientific material whether actual datasets scholarly article
The scholar date information available compared print article usually least year old
Articles online journal include retraction incorrect information addition new information either original author reader
The linkage text scholarly work enables scholar easily retrieve article pertain area scholarly inquiry without reliance library collection
The scholar develop personal electronic file article individualized material organized accessed manner best suited scholar need
The ability easily track use electronic journal article user session hit welcome benefit scholar interested documenting impact scholarly work promotion tenure committee
Most electronic journal charge reader present time thus cost reader online journal le cost print journal
In addition cost reader reprint
Many library welcomed electronic journal way circumvent high cost print journal
The rising cost associated print journal associated excessive increase cost paper rising postage rate
There however cost publisher electronic journal term extensive time commitment produce journal use facility use material equipment
Opinions cost electronic publisher varied substantially right cheap comparable print journal
See additional information cost ejournals issue OJIN
Most disadvantage electronic journal relate technical difficulty user network constraint
Other disadvantage user unfriendliness lack accessibility cost misconduct security issue time commitment lack widespread acceptance within scientific community
The reader must posse basic computing networking skill order take advantage electronic journal
Basic computer skill needed addition ability navigate World Wide Web
In order get potential benefit online journal reader able create personal electronic file article interest
The ability one reader must acquired prior use electronic journal
Since amount helpfulness instruction specific journal varies widely novice computer user may find experience searching accessing online journal frustrating impossible
Obviously someone without computer experience need help use electronic journal
Readers computer expertise may also find experience accessing online journal frustrating
Network constraint telecommunication problem abound
Electronic journal include graphic sound often slow access
The lack technical standardization sometimes result inability reader access site
It unusual find host site accessible time reader trying access host site current ejournal impossible access
User friendliness varies widely
Although many online journal contain excellent information user unfriendliness result nonuse journal
The reader required scroll linearly article may create boredom eyestrain discomfort reading screen
In addition standard pattern presentation information
People used reading print journal may find lack conventional presentation troublesome
Frequency publication length article considerably different various online journal
Bishop reported number scholarly paper published per year electronic journal ranged one twelve
The reader want access back issue may find task daunting considering number step required simplicity following command highly variable among journal
User friendliness also limited lack consistency availability current accurate information subscribing retrieving electronic journal
Lastly reader used marking copy print article may miss print article advantage
However able print electronic article mark heart content
There financial time cost related use electronic journal
The user must computer monitor software service provider browser
User demographic suggest equal access online journal
Miller reported www user survey user found United States male average income US average age year old
These finding suggest online journal le accessible outside United States female low income family older adult grow computer must learn computer skill scratch
Murray Anthony reported nurse United Kingdom Europe access World Wide Web
It estimated maximum nurse United Kingdom access
Murray Anthony also report country accessing journal high connectivity low user base many country outside United States
Low use may also relate nonuse English second language
Accessibility also severely limited electronic journal indexed standard source indexing abstracting
The reader therefore limited personal ability independently search World Wide Web electronic publication
The search made difficult access mode vary
Although misconduct security issue print journal heightened fear electronic journal
Publishers author concerned falsification information piracy plagiarism
Electronic publication enables reader easily download article dataset
Consequently reader easily edit plagiarize copy entire document change actual article image data
Rosenberg belief electronic publication destroy copyright know
The wide variability quality article electronic journal resulted lack general acceptance scientific merit article published online journal
This due fact article peer reviewed
Jones Cook provide compelling argument peer review standard used print journal applied electronic journal
Shamp found assistant associate full professor think institution would accept electronic publication evidence scholarly productivity
Although electronic journal widely accepted print journal evidence scholarly productivity present time significant change widespread acceptance scholarly electronic publication seen Schloman
Print journal advantageous compared electronic journal particularly access computer service provider lacking prerequisite skill search access electronic publication
Advantages print journal user friendliness acceptance within scientific community
Use print journal requires ability read understand language computer skill required
Since print journal medium used five century reader comfortable format display feature including page layout print quality text structure formatting feature table content page number
Familiarity print journal facilitates ease reading actual article
Scholars easily create individualized file journal article
Of course article marked reader desire
The regularity print journal published established journal well known reader
Readers thus count publication print journal specified time unlike many electronic publication timetable fluid
Print journal widespread acceptance within scientific community result five century established rule engagement
These rule include standard judge quality editorial content differentiate author shill editorial advertising education promotion evidence opinion science hype
Print journal served time mechanism authenticity guaranteed work preserved future
There disadvantage associated print journal including cost dissemination user friendliness lack communication collaboration lack facilitation scholarly work
The cost print journal rising exponentially
Subscription price individual library soaring paper ink mailing expense risen
Individual scholar limited financial resource limited access library may able access relevant print journal
The explosive growth information production along publication material print journal created major problem library cost maintaining journal collection skyrocketed
The cost maintaining journal collection archiving past collection significant
Although cited frequently disadvantage print journal proliferation paper environmentally destructive
The process print article submission review article production dissemination article slow
This major implication inability reader date information
Although print journal usually user friendly use English first second language print article may incomprehensible
Translation reader native tongue requires obtaining hardcopy article translation service
This much difficult accomplish using translation software sometimes available online publication
Communication within print journal usually limited letter editor one time response
The space requirement print journal also limit continuing dialog
Print journal offer far le opportunity communication collaboration electronic journal
Letters editor appear month initial article presented reader may easy access article discussed letter
One important criterion assessing impact scholarly work academe number source citation one scientific work
The scholar able ascertain scholar use work publication via standard indexing source
However impossible document readership specific print journal article
This contrast electronic journal article number reader specific article well amount time spent reading article identified
Electronic journal evolved rapidly last year
Miller stated Electronic publication ten year like everything else related computer probably bear little resemblance anything exists today pp
Although certain numerous unpredictable advance prediction future delineated paragraph seem likely author opinion
Readers routinely enjoy timely animated graphic sound moving image aesthetically pleasing format
First predict evolution electronic journal continue progress rapidly majority publication becoming fully interactive
Multimedia feature cease limited user equipment service
Readers routinely enjoy timely animated graphic sound moving image aesthetically pleasing format
Another feature electronic publication grow collaboration reader author
This accomplished via hosting listserves chatroom including datasets posting interchange publisher author reader time article submission publication
Tenopir suggests electronic journal could include evolving version article first submission revised version including referee comment criticism accolade suggestion reader retraction correction rebuttal author
The role publisher electronic journal likely change
Publishers cater individual providing personalized information interest variety source rather printing specific journal
There fewer commercial publisher individual group self publish
Whoever take publisher role bombarded request advertise due profile World Wide Web user good potential consumer disposable income
Whereas publisher need revenue source lure big money advertising electronic journal tempting
We believe increasing number online journal subsidized advertisement
Although electronic journal free today believe cost future
This may flat yearly charge journal charge article accessed charge amount time spent journal site
Lastly electronic journal gain widespread acceptance within scientific community
This accomplished process peer review scientific print article applied electronic journal article
It conceivable electronic publication may deemed superior print journal due increased communication publisher author reader communication visible available scrutiny review
In addition electronic journal may preferable print journal specific discipline physic molecular biology music due audiovisual capability electronic journal include multidimensional representation sound
The issue accessibility related cost computer software browser service provider remain serious issue despite fact computer service provider getting cheaper
The gap have nots continue grow poverty still major problem domestically internationally
We hopeful clinical setting library community center school service setting provide equipment service afford electronic journal truly available everyone

How system planned
Are system thrown user face without planning
Who talk plan new system
A stakeholder person interest concern something especially business
A stakeholder someone might You must careful possible relevant stakeholder
Stakeholders different need desire
When planning system need account different need desire different stakeholder
There often stakeholder group group people within organization similar need desire

We work two different example help understand idea
In addition material know understand helpful think stakeholder customer
A customer person organization buy good service store business There two different type customer Internal customer people inside company using new system External customer people outside company using new system The big idea many different type stakeholder need carefully understand WHO might using system WHAT ROLE interacting using system
You always nervous one person charge project
We call management dangerous may get two different specification system
It always good idea single person describes system
In project management call senior customer senior user
Imagine chief information officer company
The company want plan system keep track employee birthday salary date employee hired
What ten question would ask plan system
It may helpful review
Please consider following example answer question This simple example A small business want plan new system
The new system computer kiosk inside store allows customer sign email newsletter
If custmer sign newsletter inside store get discount first purchase store
The owner hope discount incentive customer sign email newsletter
The business regularly email customer special offer saving
The business owner expects benefit system increased sale
The customer expect benefit system access special offer save money see new trendy store
Question stakeholder consult planning new system
Be careful hidden stakeholder group mentioned
Question example question asked stakeholder group
This complex example A school student want plan new system
The school hope new system secure application manages attendance data
The school administrator want carefully track attendance student student absent customizable threshold
For example school might set threshold absence within day automatically notifies student parent teacher problem attendance
The threshold might time within day something like
The system keep track attendance tardies
The system customizable attendance code
For example abscence school trip excused abscence medical abscence allowed abscence code
School administrator expect benefit data attendance support student parent school
School administrator also expect benefit giving parent student information attendance parent support child school
Finally school adinistrators expect benefit using attendance data government funding prove many student class specific day
Parents expect benefit knowing child school miss school
This way parent support child school
Being school school hope parent share
Students expect benefit understanding many day school missed
The school expects student strong ownership learning manage attendance

In real world software developed team part department developing software different group people customer
As software professional everything even technical task impacted fact working one set people system used different group people two group builder customer profoundly immensely different
As result successful professional requires human organization knowledge skill well technical knowledge skill
These two set knowledge skill various interaction focus course work area
Everyone studied computer science familiar fact analyzing working software system complexity critical precise systematic good framework representing fact system
There innumerable detail keep track many decision make designer programmer
Forgetting lead serious problem code
Intuition sufficient field analysis design whether exist
The true analyzing working customer organization innumerable detail lead serious problem complete failure system project
A significant portion course work area devoted expanding student ability work understand describe client organization work approach problem working client rigorous systematic approach applied design construction software
Examples specific concept topic addressed depth area include In summary technically elegant software system waste time resource organization system contribute organization need goal
There far many story system developed discarded fit actual need organization
The field design analysis software engineering systematic approach designed avoid disaster thus invaluable part software developer education

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Are developer product considered stakeholder
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
Generally yes developer stakeholder software project
That consistent
Here definition stakeholder various publication A person group organization actively involved project affected outcome influence outcome
The term used refer person group affected system directly indirectly
Stakeholders include interact system everyone else organisation may affected installation
Other system stakeholder may engineer developing maintaining related system business manager domain expert trade union representative
defines five group stakeholder senior manager define business issue manager organize control practitioner practitioner engineer system customer specify requirement software interact delivered system
My definition project stakeholder anyone direct user indirect user manager user senior manager operation staff member gold owner fund project support help desk staff member auditor manager developer working system integrate interact one development maintenance professional potentially affected development deployment software project

In definition I chosen exclude developer working project
This may seem strange first developer clearly important stake project work
Yes developer definitely project stakeholder
Why I continue distinguish developer project stakeholder
Because I want convenient term distinguish I really like different role play project
In practice I typically seen stakeholder broken group one group contains people building system
It important recognize building system developer need concern need balanced need everyone else
However need prioritized taken consideration every need
Usually
come mind main exception case developer may using build directly thus stakeholder extent
However I question percent developer overall though
Yes system live maintained
Developers likely work code fix bug introduce new feature long initial team closed project
An important requirement long lived system maintainability put stake developer
If asked relation Scrum definition project stakeholder anyone direct user indirect user manager user senior manager operation staff member gold owner fund project support help desk staff member auditor manager developer working system integrate interact one development maintenance professional potentially affected development deployment software project Stakeholders individual external current product development team one form another
If team X another developer team Y working differing product interact later point time become stakeholder others product
After bit googling I must say unanswerable question
There one definition stakeholder different source use differently
As Scott Ambler reference Aaron point one methodology avoids term altogether
Others try break different category stakeholder
The result general meaning stakeholder someone interest precise meaning lost
What interest come one two meaning mind The sponsorship body fit either definition
How end user fit sponsorship body another topic entirely
For let assume fit I willing split hair
Anyone project team fit second meaning well
In end matter value derived application understand sponsor get final word
My general feeling people want lump developer Stakeholders group largely care seen situation developer treated cog machine often treated poorly result
Feedback requirement allowed significant unpaid overtime mandatory etc
Because giving time sanity expected people inclined see investment
Investment stake mind development team stakeholder
As result I fan term
Sponsors clear
Stakeholders
They may
If postion product finished different stakeholder
For instance developer paid salary develop software company chance stakeholder nothing change afer product delivered
However partner startup financial position depends product successful I would argue stakeholder
Another example would admittedly rare case developer making software use
In case definately stakeholder vested interest software work correctly
Developers indeed stakeholder affected produced initially develop system maintain
The former tend interested new technology increasing skill base whereas latter want able keep usually large number system maintain
However stakeholder another question
When balancing requirement stakeholder certainly going find concern addressed satisfaction
Is company worried losing top developer
Bump developer concern
If developer tend end fairly low totem pole
Unfortunately effect ignoring maintainability well building technical debt like tomorrow
No
Stakeholder A person organization may affected success failure project organization Source Basically Stakeholder individual organization put simply entity influence project completion
Stakeholders important project accomplishment
Stakeholders may client usergroup project manager project leader coordinator
You satisfy expectation stakeholder project completion
I think depends project
A stake holder includes anyone stake interest system requirement say
Therefore I would include developer project code simply pushed door forgotten would include supporting project extending developer require system
By posting answer agree

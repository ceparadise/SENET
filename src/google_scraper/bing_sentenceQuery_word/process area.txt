In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

To provide background Steven Wartik blog posting Scientific American titled
The article cover good topic question leaf open answer
Should discipline Computer Science based
What kind answer get people seemed think deeply
What reason give
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
There two distinct IT discipline Computer Science discipline study computer computation using scientific method
Software Engineering discipline designing implementing software following proper engineering principle
The two overlap somewhat distinction really desired outcome science versus engineering
The desired outcome scientific discipline knowledge
The desired outcome engineering discipline thing work
So answer question Is Computer Science science applied mathematics engineering art philosophy
Other
Computer Science Science done properly
However like discipline CS overlap Mathematics Engineering Physical Sciences Social Sciences Philosophy
I would also add programmer neither Computer Science Software Engineering
It like craftsman
And sad say neither academic Computer Science Software Engineering profession rigorous older science engineering discipline
There field Computer Science traditionally rigorous example one strong mathematical basis
But many field simply hard expensive proper scientific study question really matter
Programmers rarely computer science
They mostly result software engineering engineering discipline obviously
Other Computer Science Applied Mathematics
If compare CS something indubitably belonging applied math notice lot resemblance
Computer scientist design study way computation algorithm taking theory Mathematics logic graph theory combinatorics etc contributing time
Just like rest applied mathematics
They evaluate property model algorithm theoretically carry modeling experiment write test program
Like applied mathematician simulate flow liquid tube cluster computer scientist use computer experiment implementation algorithm
The result experiment go directly production either oil refinery software stock analytics
In university I finished even special department computer science among domain computer science chair part Department Applied Maths
Computer Science term day cover many many thing Note distinct naming instead computer scientist
The difference Computer Science new naming settle
First science
This deal mathematics behind computation
There discipline oriented towards engineering
The difference related science engineering discipline
One accuracy precision
Computing science theoretical others science applied problem branch engineering
Computer science applied mathematics
Computer science branch applied mathematics deal design application computational automaton
Software engineering proper subset computer science deal formalized design construction code von Neumann architecture
The von Neumann architecture one way implement computing machine
For example machine used crack message von Neumann machine
Software engineering practitioner discipline
Computer science discipline
Most computer scientist undergrad end software development research requires one hold least master degree enforces belief computer science glorified programming certificate
The discipline accurately called Computer Science university I checked applied science similar engineering discipline major receive BS MS
Texas Tech CS degree offered Engineering college
The discipline taught mostly theoretical learn concept Turing machine fundamental concept programmer really keep rattling around skull
You also get pantload higher math Texas Tech CS degree I bet many others well pretty much hand Mathematics minor go
To university degree track add hefty dash practical application learn assembly language language explore computer graphic operating system even good bit electrical design
However people code living computer scientist strictly speaking software developer add software engineer job much le though know basic much system analysis design coding
Many university different track Texas Tech called Management Information Systems Business degree
That track lighter higher math know algebra calc squeezed two semester business math include calc linear algebra etc much heavier financial math semester stats finance two accounting economics
Lighter operating system heavier stack technology database web server networking general system administration
Lighter language circuit design AI heavier language system analysis project management
I got degree Texas Tech time I left I least semester Java VB C web language plus year OOA D various course IT project management
Which better real world
I got MIS BBA brother got CS BS employed roughly salary level adjusting cost living senior software engineer
He learn lot required OOA D job well spin pretty quickly C basic knowledge
For part I wish I two semester conceptual algorithm study got I stuck business management course yes MIS Management degree I found knowledge manage manage people learned example

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field

I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

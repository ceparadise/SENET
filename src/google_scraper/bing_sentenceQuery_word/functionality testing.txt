Functional testing software testing process used within software development software tested ensure conforms requirement
Functional testing way checking software ensure required functionality specified within functional requirement
Functional testing primarily used verify piece software providing output required business
Typically functional testing involves evaluating comparing software function business requirement
Software tested providing related input output evaluated see conforms relates varies compared base requirement
Moreover functional testing also check software usability ensuring navigational function working required
Some functional testing technique include smoke testing white box testing black box testing unit testing user acceptance testing

It important use test plan carry different type test
There many different test carried
make sure system allows data entered
Unless input data sensible computer could crash produce result make sense
clarify program working intended producing expected
This based criterion set first stage
look specific function within program
The purpose functional test see system unit work way user would expect work
It involves checking list function designed perform specification see intended
look bigger picture program performs
For example program might perform expected functional one user crash unexpectedly multiple user use

Software testing give independent view software allow business understand risk implementating software
The software Test system limited executing program application finding software bug existing software developed one created customer request
Software Testing also define process validating verifying software programe application product meet business requirement helped design developthe software testing occur requirement fulfilled system developed execution programe
The software testing mostly done professional software tester
The software tester term used generally software tester term became proper separate profession
In software testing many role established like Managers test lead test designer tester test administrator
The functional testing normally take test vereify specific function code also action kind testing normally found documentation code functional testing software normally take answer following question
user ables particular part codeing feature work
The Non functional testing normally take test software could related specific function user Non functional testing normally take answer following question example many user log possible hack software easly
The software testing take place association validation verification software
Verification The verification software testing mean know Software developed built example fulfill match user requirement specification software
Validation The validation software mean built right software customer want built
There issoftware testing approach taken perform software testing
The Box approach The box approach manly divide two part Black box testing white box testing The black box testing treat software black box mean testing take without knowing knowledge internal implementation Black box testing approach testing model based testing specification based testing
testing The specification testing use test functionalty software system according software tester input data able see output test type testing normally requires test case provided tester tester verify data given input output testing either expected
The specification testing important necessary would good certain risk
The white box testing another method test white box testing method done tester internal access data structure programe code implement type white box testing API Testing The API stand application programming interface API testing test application using public private API

What difference unit test functional test
Can unit test also test function
Unit Test testing individual unit method function class dependency mocked
Functional Test AKA Integration Test testing slice functionality system
This test many method may interact dependency like Databases Web Services
Unit test tell developer code thing right functional test tell developer code
You read A well explained analogy unit testing functional testing described follows Many time development system likened building house
While analogy quite correct extend purpose understanding difference unit functional test
Unit testing analogous building inspector visiting house construction site
He focused various internal system house foundation framing electrical plumbing
He ensures test part house work correctly safely meet building code
Functional test scenario analogous homeowner visiting construction site
He assumes internal system behave appropriately building inspector performing task
The homeowner focused like live house
He concerned house look various room comfortable size house fit family need window good spot catch morning sun
The homeowner performing functional test house
He user perspective
The building inspector performing unit test house
He builder perspective
As summary Unit Tests written perspective
They made ensure particular method class performs set specific task
Functional Tests written perspective
They ensure system user expecting
A unit test test
What unit behavior
It smallest piece system independently unit tested
This definition actually circular IOW really definition seems work quite well practice understand intuitively
A functional test test independent piece functionality
A unit behavior small I absolutely dislike stupid one unit test per method mantra perspective right
A unit behavior something part method maybe couple method
At object one
A piece functionality usually comprises many method cut across several object often multiple architectural layer
A unit test would something like I call function pas country code return
A functional test would I fill shipping form country code I redirected help page allows pick country code menu
Unit test written developer developer developer perspective
Functional test may user facing case written developer together user maybe right tool right user even user user user perspective
Or may developer facing
describe internal piece functionality user care case written developer developer still user perspective
In former case functional test may also serve acceptance test executable encoding functional requirement functional specification latter case may also serve integration test
Unit test change frequently functional test never change within major release
TLDR To answer question Unit Testing Functional Testing
There two big group Testing
The best illustration I found one source testing small snippet code
It may considered functional testing
When function put together create module standalone piece possibly User Interface tested Module Testing
Once least two separate module glue together come put two piece sub module sub system together see play nicely together
Then integrate module whatever order team see fit jigsaw piece placed together come testing SW whole
This pretty much Integration testing piece together
If OK come build customer asked actually
last stage realise customer wanted sportscar built van
Functional test mean testing function method code
It mean generally testing system functionality I run command line line become reversed perhaps
In contrast single unit test generally cover single case single method return return

In Rails unit folder meant hold test model functional folder meant hold test controller integration folder meant hold test involve number controller interacting
Fixtures way organizing test data reside fixture folder
The file hold default configuration test
u visit
According ISTQB two comparable
Functional testing integration testing
Unit test one test level functional testing type testing
Basically The function system component
This typically described requirement specification functional specification use case
Component testing also known unit module program testing search defect verifies functioning software
module program object class etc
separately testable
According ISTQB test functional Component testing may include testing functionality specific characteristic
memory leak performance robustness testing well structural testing
decision coverage
Quotes The way I think like A unit test establishes code intended code
wanted add parameter b fact add subtract functional test test code work together get correct result intended code fact get right result system
The basic distinction though functional test test application outside point view user
Unit test test application inside point view programmer
Functional test help build application right functionality guarantee never accidentally break
Unit test help write code clean bug free
Unit testing includes testing smallest unit code usually function method
Unit testing mostly done developer understand core function
The main goal developer cover code unit test
It limitation function tested unit test
Even successful completion unit test guarantee correct operation product
The function used part system unit test written one usage
It type Black Box testing testing done functional aspect product without looking code
Functional testing mostly done dedicated Software tester
It include positive negative BVA technique using un standardized data testing specified functionality product
Test coverage conducted improved manner functional test unit test
It us application GUI testing easier determine exactly specific part interface responsible rather determine code function responsible
Unit testing particularly used test product component component specially product development
Junit Nunit type tool also help test product per Unit
solving issue Integration always comfortable get resolved early development
Functional Testing As Testing concerned two main type Testing Test Test
Test test Tester test The product perform quality attribute customer mention quality attribute
Like Usability Security Load Stress etc
The customer already present requirement properly documented The tester task Cross check whether Application Functionality performing according Proposed System
For purpose Tester test Implemented functionality proposed System
AFAIK unit testing NOT functional testing
Let explain small example
You want test login functionality email web app working user would
For functional test like
Should functional test check login invalid input
Eg
Email symbol username one dot one dot permitted appears etc

Generally
That kind testing go unit test
You check invalid input rejected inside unit test shown test
Notice functional test actually unit test
Sometimes functional test repeat testing done unit test different reason
In example use functional test check particular entering invalid input
We want test bad input rejected
That job unit test
usually done developer
The objective make sure code work properly
General rule thumb cover path code using unit testing

Software Testing Complete Guide Posted In We tester aware various type Software Testing Functional Testing Testing Automation Testing Testing etc
Each u would come across several type testing testing journey
We might heard might worked everyone knowledge testing type
Each type testing feature advantage disadvantage well
However article I covered mostly every type software testing usually use day day testing life
Let go look
What You Will Learn It common type testing used software industry
The objective testing identify possible issue defect releasing market user
Alpha testing carried end software development phase Beta Testing
Still minor design change may made result testing
conducted developer site
virtual user environment created type testing
An acceptance test performed client verifies whether end end flow system per business requirement per need end user
Client accepts software feature functionality work expected
It last phase testing software go production
This also called User Acceptance Testing UAT
The name suggests testing performed basis
reference test case also without plan documentation place type testing
The objective testing find defect break application executing flow application random functionality
testing informal way finding defect performed anyone project
It difficult identify defect without test case sometimes possible defect found testing might identified using existing test case
The aim determine whether software application accessible disabled people
Here disability mean deaf color blind mentally disabled blind old age disabled group
Various check performed font size visually disabled color contrast color blindness etc
It formal type software testing carried customer
It performed releasing product market actual end user
Beta testing carried ensure major failure software product satisfies business requirement perspective
Beta testing successful customer accepts software
Usually testing typically done others
It final testing done releasing application commercial Beta version software product released limited certain number user specific area
So end user actually us software share feedback company
Company take necessary action releasing software worldwide
Whenever input data entered application store database testing database known
There different database like SQL Server MySQL Oracle etc
Database testing involves testing table structure schema stored procedure data structure
In testing GUI involved tester directly connected database proper access tester easily verify data running query database
There issue identified like data loss deadlock data corruption etc testing issue critical fixing system go live production environment It subtype Compatibility Testing explained performed testing team
Browser Compatibility Testing performed web application ensures software run combination different browser operating system
This type testing also validates whether web application run version browser
It type testing validates whether newly developed software updated software work well older version environment
Backward Compatibility Testing check whether new version software work properly file format created older version software also work well data table data file data structure created older version software
If software updated work well top previous version software
Internal system design considered type testing
Tests based requirement functionality
Detailed information advantage disadvantage type Black box testing seen
This type testing check behavior application boundary level
Testing performed checking defect exist boundary value
Boundary value testing used testing different range number
There upper lower boundary range testing performed boundary value
If testing requires test range number Boundary Value Testing performed value
It type white box testing carried unit testing
Branch Testing name suggests code tested thoroughly traversing every branch
Comparison product strength weakness previous version similar product termed Comparison Testing
It testing type validates software behaves run different environment web server hardware network environment
ensures software run different configuration different database different browser version
Compatibility testing performed testing team
It mostly performed developer completion unit testing
Component Testing involves testing multiple functionality single code objective identify defect exists connecting multiple functionality
Similar system testing involves testing complete application environment situation mimic use interacting database using network communication interacting hardware application system appropriate
It testing technique type Black Box Testing
During equivalence partitioning set group selected value number picked testing
It understood value group generate output
The aim testing remove within specific group generates output defect
Suppose application accepts value using equivalence partitioning value picked testing zero one positive value one negative value
So Equivalence Partitioning testing
It mean testing
Example testing includes scenario also involves scenario based experience tester
Exploratory Testing informal testing performed testing team
The objective testing explore application looking defect exist application
Sometimes may happen testing major defect discovered even cause system failure
During exploratory testing advisable keep track flow tested activity start specific flow
performed without documentation test case
This type testing ignores internal part focus output check per requirement
It type testing geared functional requirement application
For detailed information Functional Testing click
The objective GUI testing validate GUI per business requirement
The expected GUI application mentioned Detailed Design Document GUI mockup screen
The GUI testing includes size button input field present screen alignment text table content table
It also validates menu application selecting different menu menu item validates page fluctuate alignment remains hovering mouse menu
Gorilla Testing testing type performed tester sometimes developer well
In Gorilla Testing one module functionality module tested thoroughly heavily
The objective testing check robustness application
The objective Happy Path Testing test application successfully positive flow
It look negative error condition
The focus valid positive input application generates expected output
This approach testing continuous testing application new functionality added
Application functionality module independent enough test separately
This done programmer tester
Testing done full partial upgrade process different operating system different hardware software environment termed
Testing integrated module verify combined functionality integration termed
Modules typically code module individual application client server application network etc
This type testing especially relevant distributed system
It type testing objective Load testing check much load maximum workload system handle without performance degradation
Load testing help find maximum capacity system specific load issue cause software performance degradation
Load testing performed using tool like LoadRunner WebLoad Silk performer etc
Monkey testing carried tester assuming monkey us application random input value entered Monkey without knowledge understanding application
The objective Monkey Testing check application system get crashed providing random input
Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary aware full functionality system
Mutation Testing type white box testing source code one program changed verifies whether existing test case identify defect system
The change program source code minimal impact entire application specific area impact related test case able identify error system
Testers mindset attitude break using negative testing validate system application break
performed using incorrect data invalid data input
It validates system throw error invalid input behaves expected
It type testing every organization separate team usually called Test NFT team Performance team
NFT testing involves testing requirement Load Testing Stress Testing Security Volume Recovery Testing etc
The objective NFT testing ensure whether response time software application quick enough per business requirement
It take much time load page system sustain peak load
This term often used interchangeably stress load testing
done check whether system meet performance requirement
Different performance load tool used testing
It type testing validates well application system recovers crash disaster
Recovery testing determines system able continue operation disaster
Assume application receiving data network cable suddenly network cable unplugged
Sometime later plug network cable system start receiving data lost connection due network cable unplugged
Testing application whole modification module functionality termed Regression Testing
It difficult cover system typically used type testing
In Risk Based Testing functionality requirement tested based priority
testing includes testing highly critical functionality highest impact business probability failure high
The priority decision based business need priority set functionality high priority functionality test case executed first followed medium low priority functionality
The low priority functionality may tested tested based available time
The testing carried insufficient time available test entire software software need implemented time without delay
This approach followed discussion approval client senior management organization
Sanity Testing done determine new software version performing well enough accept major testing effort
If application crashing initial use system stable enough testing
Hence build application assigned fix
It type testing performed special team tester
A system penetrated hacking way
done check software application website secure internal external threat
This testing includes much software secure malicious program virus secure strong authorization authentication process
It also check software behaves hacker attack malicious program software maintained data security hacker attack
Whenever new build provided development team software testing team validates build ensures major issue exists
The testing team ensures build stable detailed level testing carried
check show stopper defect exists build prevent testing team test application detail
If tester find major critical functionality broken initial stage testing team reject build inform accordingly development team
Smoke Testing carried detailed level functional regression testing
Static Testing type testing executed without code
The execution performed documentation testing phase
It involves review walkthrough inspection deliverable project
Static testing execute code instead code syntax naming convention checked
The also applicable test case test plan design document
It necessary perform static testing testing team defect identified type testing project perspective
This testing done system stressed beyond specification order check fails
This performed heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity complex database query continuous input system database load
Under entire system tested per requirement
It type testing based overall requirement specification cover combined part system
Testing individual software component module termed Unit Testing
It typically done programmer tester requires detailed knowledge internal program design code
It may also require developing test driver module test harness
Under testing check done
Application flow tested know new user understand application easily Proper help documented user get stuck point
Basically system navigation checked testing
The testing involves identifying weakness software hardware network known Vulnerability Testing
Malicious program hacker take control system vulnerable kind attack virus worm
So necessary check system undergo Vulnerability Testing production
It may identify critical defect flaw security
It type testing performed performance testing team
The software application undergoes huge amount data Volume Testing check system behavior response time application system came across high volume data
This high volume data may impact system performance speed processing time
This testing based knowledge internal logic application code
It also known Glass box Testing
Internal software code working known performing type testing
Under test based coverage code statement branch path condition etc
For information white box testing type please click
The testing type part testing
However still list type testing testing type used type project
So I covered common Types Software Testing mostly used testing life cycle
Also alternative definition process used different organization basic concept everywhere
These testing type process implementation method keep changing project requirement scope change
valuable information type testing Thanks Namita Actually I planning detail description type later thought big mess single post
I take one type time future posting
usefull software tester student alpha testing beta testing sequrity usefull thanking u I need sample general checklist detailed checklist need create control chart
It really good
It simple giving good idea
Hello question real time founding bug send developer developer asks clear step better understanding bug sending also unable understand status given developer situation
THIS INFERMATION IS
I NEED FULL INFERMATION ABOUT MERCURY QUALITY U SEND IT

The information provided u really helping
Can u give information java testing
hai This reply answer
Typically know basic knowledge testing mean knowledge enough kind software testing
difference functional testing systemtesting Naga Vishala In case developer might ask bug reporter detail bug make status bug Need Info Thilak The answer NO
Think development If theoretical knowledge programming language say write program using language
No must knowledge
If basic knowledge software testing enough testing type
You gain knowledge type using basic knowledge
chengaiah Functional testing black box testing without considering program structure
You verify program using specification document
System testing end end application testing includes whole application one unit generally tested usability functionality performance load

doughts send
mail Aruna Sanity testing done updated version software
adding change software check function desired way
One example would suppose new service pack window operating system tested first check whether operating system work required even applying new service pack fail aspect
Smoke testing generally done immediately development phase
Its main aim find software would provide basic functionality wouldnt crash completely ensure software would able sustain exhaustive list test case

phase SDLC testing
hello friend Can tell specifide result project testing
Folks Lot people asking difference Smoke Sanity testing
And info get confused people becoming
Let make simple Difference Smoke Sanity Smoke testing done verify build tested done properly
The build new updated version software
The motive check application build working fine crash
For example say application following feature say feature page case feature page Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Smoke Test Check page displayed properly broken link page
Check button page clickable disabled hidden
Check traverse back forth page
Check see help section page legal disclaimer section page outgoing link page Check look feel page font user text box displayed properly broken image cluttered text font scramble optional check unless see something unreadable Check able enter info input box need transaction check whether able input text page
Note required transaction Smoke test
In word testing functionality application application build
Sanity Testing done verify whether new updated build functioning properly
Note difference smoke check application build sanity check build functionality higher level
Take example say application following feature Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Sanity Test Check customer critical functionality working performing least one transaction major feature
Your depth sanity testing depends functionality application
Say major feature application
So need perform one transaction feature verify major feature working properly
Sanity test concentrate testing major feature
A feature said major accessed customer frequently daily working important business
Now say login logout enter info delete info generate record main feature application
Sanity test Check able login Check able logout Check able enter info save record new user
Check able delete data existing user
Check generate report current date
You need test rest feature
Nor require run exhaustive test case major feature
Note check basic functioning major feature working
Don run end end multiple operation test case sanity
Just ran Basic test case feature designed
Hope everyone got clear understanding Smoke Sanity testing
And Difference Well
Lets make Cheers Sameer hi I finished BCA like testing course dont know testing join

effect tool testing PHP project use
Hi Phalguna I think PHP inbuild tool used run test script
Or dont u download free
call mail Present working software company data tool use company open source tool effective testing tool tell effective tool evailble open source
test plan write properly
Hi I got lot info
The defn testing type ready HI EVERY ONE TELL ME HOW TO WRITE TEST CASE
eg like mobile fan etc plese ergnt A test plan base line testing activity A test plan address
When
And
Test planning ass software application risk develops plan determine software minimizes risk Testers must understand development method environment effectively plan testing The tester must understand new increased risk order evaluate control computer application The test plan focused identified risk An Ideal Test Plan comprise Test Scope Test Objective Assumptions Risk Analysis Test Design Roles Responsibilities Test Schedule Resources Test Data Management Test Environment Communication Approach Test Tools Vijay In article End End testing explained wrong
The name give exact definition
Say Example ATM transaction End End testing test performed inserting card get cash reciept card
That mean entire functioniality application input output know End To End Testing
Cheers george ya completely agree George
System Testing called end end testing scratch application entire functionality application every part application checked ita proper functionality
In actual testing final phase testing entire application tested functionality prior User Acceptance Testing
Hi back
This time info System testing people seem
You may asked question interview System testing
What difference Functional System Testing
Functional Testing Everyone know I going explain keep short test functionality software product functional testing
All feature transaction checked functional The common type testing
System Testing Like must read comment End End type testing
mean
You test software right login till
Test everything system testing
M kidding
Then system
It mean check system
Check functionally well Check functionality functional testing
Check requirement like Usability Accessibility Compatibility Localization Performance I recall rest In short supposed test everything kind testing System testing
That called One liner definition system testing To make simple system testing check functional well requirement software
Functional requirement affect product directly like feature whereas requirement affect product like page load time compatibility different browser user friendliness localization
So important check requirement well
Hope everyone clear Lets make Cheers Sameer K meant database testing
done real time
dear friend Computer science working lecturer CS
I interesting working programming testing
For shifter present career new field stftware testing
learing thing testing
please help fresher jon testing
thanks DB Testing Hi shreya I idea database real time base supoose u testing Payroll System Payslip
u wil enter data like employee name basicsalary empId outerface design u enter data base check data insert database properly time data insert wrong manner becase u must check database every module u chek compare databse
Hope u idea plese replay Cheers PHALGUNA Hi shreya I idea database real time base supoose u testing Payroll System Payslip
u wil enter data like employee name basicsalary empId outerface design u enter data base check data insert database properly time data insert wrong manner becase u must check database every module u check compare databse
Hope u idea plese replay Cheers PHALGUNA well explanation sameer
I confustion cheer jk Hi phalguna Thanks ur reply I need extra info db testing I know like entering data outer interface checking database
I heard need perform I wanted know wtelse thing mentioned happen db hai Plz one tell difference stress load testing example Hi All Here difference see SMOKE TESTING Smoke testing originated hardware testing practice turning new piece hardware first time considering success catch fire smoke
In software industry smoke testing shallow wide approach whereby area application without getting deep tested
A smoke test using written set test automated test A Smoke test designed touch every part application cursory way
It shallow wide
Smoke testing conducted ensure whether crucial function program work bothering finer detail
Such build verification
Smoke testing normal health check build application taking testing depth
SANITY TESTING A sanity test narrow regression test focus one area functionality
Sanity testing usually narrow deep
A sanity test usually unscripted
A Sanity test used determine small section application still working minor change
Sanity testing cursory testing performed whenever cursory testing sufficient prove application functioning according specification
This level testing subset regression testing
sanity testing verify whether requirement met checking feature

mentioned Regression Testing given Below What Regression Testing
Introduction This article attempt take close look process technique Regression Testing
What Regression Testing
If piece Software modified reason testing need done ensure work specified negatively impacted functionality offered previously
This known Regression Testing
Regression Testing attempt verify That application work specified even made The original functionality continues work specified even software application The software application introduced new bug When Regression Testing necessary
Regression Testing play important role Scenario change made previously tested software code
Regression Testing hence important aspect various Software Methodologies software change enhancement occur frequently
Any Software Development Project invariably faced request changing Design code feature
Some Development Methodologies embrace change
For example Extreme Programming Methodology advocate applying small incremental change system based end user feedback
Each change implies Regression Testing need done ensure System meet Project Goals
Why Regression Testing important
Any Software change cause existing functionality break
Changes Software component could impact dependent Components
It commonly observed Software fix could cause bug
All affect quality reliability system
Hence Regression Testing since aim verify important
Making Regression Testing Cost Effective Every time change occurs one following scenario may occur More Functionality may added system More complexity may added system New bug may introduced New vulnerability may introduced system System may tend become fragile change After change new functionality may tested along original functionality
With change Regression Testing could become costly
To make Regression Testing Cost Effective yet ensure good coverage one following technique may applied Test Automation If Test case automated test case may executed using script change introduced system
The execution test case way help eliminate oversight human error
It may also result faster cheaper execution Test case
However cost involved building script
Selective Testing Some Teams choose execute test case selectively
They execute Test Cases Regression Testing
They test decide relevant
This help reduce Testing Time Effort
Regression Testing What Test
Since Regression Testing tends verify software application change made everything may impacted change tested Regression Testing
Generally following area covered Regression Testing Any functionality addressed change Original Functionality system Performance System change introduced Regression Testing How Test
Like Testing Regression Testing Needs proper planning
For Effective Regression Testing done following ingredient necessary Create Regression Test Plan Test Plan identified Focus Areas Strategy Test Entry Exit Criteria
It also outline Testing Prerequisites Responsibilities etc
Create Test Cases Test Cases cover necessary area important
They describe Test Steps needed test Inputs Expected Outputs
Test Cases used Regression Testing specifically cover functionality addressed change component affected change
The Regression Test case may also include testing performance component application change done
Defect Tracking As Testing Levels Types It important Defects tracked systematically otherwise undermines Testing Effort
Thanks Suresh Hi Yamini This Suresh Working Test Engineer
mentioned Test Strategy given Below Test strategy hope brief version test case Test strategy company level document say approch test strategy doc also say scope business issue test delivarables tool used risk analysis etc

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

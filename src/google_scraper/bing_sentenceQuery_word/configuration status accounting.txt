process establishing maintaining consistency product performance functional physical attribute requirement design operational information throughout life
The CM process widely used military organization manage change throughout system
Outside military CM process also used IT service management defined segment
CM applied life cycle system provides visibility control performance functional physical attribute
CM verifies system performs intended identified documented sufficient detail support projected life cycle
The CM process facilitates orderly management system information system change beneficial purpose revise capability improve performance reliability maintainability extend life reduce cost reduce risk liability correct defect
The relatively minimal cost implementing CM returned many fold cost avoidance
The lack CM ineffectual implementation expensive sometimes catastrophic consequence failure equipment loss life
CM emphasizes functional relation part subsystem system effectively controlling system change
It help verify proposed change systematically considered minimize adverse effect
Changes system proposed evaluated implemented using standardized systematic approach ensures consistency proposed change evaluated term anticipated impact entire system
CM verifies change carried prescribed documentation item system reflects true configuration
A complete CM program includes provision storing tracking updating system information component subsystem system basis
A structured CM program ensures documentation requirement design test acceptance documentation item accurate consistent actual physical design item
In many case without CM documentation exists consistent item
For reason engineer contractor management frequently forced develop documentation reflecting actual status item proceed change
This process wasteful term human resource minimized eliminated using CM
Configuration Management originated technical management discipline hardware material standard practice virtually every industry
The CM process became technical discipline sometime late DoD developed series called series subsequently issued
In series consolidated single standard known replaced pursuant general DoD goal reduced number military standard favor industry supported SDO
This marked beginning evolved widely distributed accepted standard CM
Now widely adopted numerous organization agency CM discipline concept include SE ILS CMMI project management method ITIL
Many function model redefined CM traditional holistic approach technical management
Some treat CM similar librarian activity break change control change management separate stand alone discipline
CM practice handling change systematically maintains time
CM implement policy procedure technique tool manage evaluate proposed change track status change maintain inventory system support document system change
CM program plan provide technical administrative direction development implementation procedure function service tool process resource required successfully develop
During system development CM allows track requirement throughout acceptance operation maintenance
As change inevitably occur requirement design must approved documented creating accurate record system status
Ideally CM process applied throughout
Most professional mix get confused AM inventory asset hand
The key difference CM AM former manage financial accounting aspect
The CM process item comprises five distinct discipline established
These discipline carried policy procedure establishing performing standard process
The process also activity add Release management delivery
The five discipline The traditional software configuration management SCM process looked upon practitioner best solution handling change software project
It identifies functional physical attribute software various point time performs systematic control change identified attribute purpose maintaining software integrity traceability throughout software development life cycle
The SCM process defines need trace change ability verify final delivered software planned enhancement supposed included release
It identifies four procedure must defined software project ensure sound SCM process implemented
They These term definition change standard standard essentially
The ITIL specifies use Configuration management system CMS CMDB mean achieving industry best practice Configuration Management
CMDBs used track Configuration Items CIs dependency CIs represent thing enterprise worth tracking managing limited computer software software license rack network device storage even component within item
The benefit includes able perform function like root cause analysis impact analysis change management current state assessment future state strategy development
Example system commonly identifies system include
For CM defined management security feature assurance control change made hardware software firmware documentation test test fixture test documentation throughout life cycle information system
CM information assurance sometimes referred ecure onfiguration anagement relies upon performance functional physical attribute IT platform product environment determine appropriate security feature assurance used measure system configuration state
For example configuration requirement may different function part organization Internet boundary versus one function internal local
Configuration management used maintain understanding status complex asset view maintaining highest level serviceability lowest cost
Specifically aim ensure operation disrupted due asset part asset overrunning limit planned lifespan quality level
In military type activity often classed mission readiness seek define asset available type mission classic example whether aircraft board aircraft carrier equipped bomb ground support missile defense
Configuration management used maintain configuration file
Example system include
Many system utilize define maintain configuration
A theory configuration maintenance worked practical implementation present day computer system software able perform real time repair well preventive maintenance
Understanding state asset major component essential element preventive maintenance used maintenance repair overhaul system
Complex asset aircraft ship industrial machinery etc
depend many different component serviceable
This serviceability often defined term amount usage component since new since fitted since repaired amount use life several limiting factor
Understanding near end life component major undertaking involving record keeping recent development software
Many type component use electronic sensor capture data provides live
This data analyzed board remote location computer evaluate current serviceability increasingly likely future state using algorithm predict potential future failure based previous example failure field experience modeling
This basis predictive maintenance
Availability accurate timely data essential order CM provide operational value lack often limiting factor
Capturing disseminating operating data various support organization becoming industry
The consumer data grown numerous complex growth program offered original equipment manufacturer OEMs
These designed offer operator guaranteed availability make picture complex operator managing asset OEM taking liability ensure serviceability
A number standard support include configuration management including More recently configuration management applied large construction project often complex huge amount detail change need documented
Construction agency Federal Highway Administration used configuration management infrastructure project
There configuration management tool aim document change order RFIs order ensure project stay schedule budget
These program also store information aid maintenance modification infrastructure completed
One application ccsNet tested case study funded Federal Transportation Administration FTA efficacy configuration management measured comparing approximately complete construction Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency LACMTA segment Red Line billion rail construction project
This study yielded result indicating benefit using configuration management project nature

Software configuration management SCM plain CM organizational framework discipline managing evolution computer system throughout stage system development
That rigorous framework producing quality computer system needed undeniable according following statistic During past decade capability sheer innovativeness software technology far outpaced ability manage complexity problem software development must address
Unfortunately ability develop deliver reliable usable software within budget schedule commitment continues elude many software organization
Software configuration management SCM provides mean manage software process structured orderly productive manner
SCM span area software life cycle impact data see Chapter process
Hence maximum benefit derived SCM viewed engineering discipline rather art form unfortunately many developer tendency
As engineering discipline SCM provides level support control service organization The process SCM really changed much past year
However environment SCM operates within changed significantly likely continue change
Over past decade migrated centralized mainframe using programming language COBOL FORTRAN decentralized networked environment thousand device using hundred software package dozen programming language
The significant impact SCM centered automated tool library system operate upon
Up entire focus SCM version control vendor choose
Today literally hundred small large SCM vendor promoting variety product simple version control sophisticated tool purport establish monitor entire software development production environment
Regardless amazing diversity process CM basically immutable process change managed change
What mean CM applicable mainframe shop shop running application networked secured environment
The key process
Improvement depends upon changing current process along accompanying environment
SCM provides underlying structure change process improvement
We refer configuration management
For example first step improve product know product currently produced
The second step improvement foster atmosphere change readily accommodated
If change appear possible improvement also unlikely
SCM measurement current practice associated metric help identify process working need improved
Such change effort lead increased productivity integrity conformance customer satisfaction
The Institute Configuration Management ICM defines configuration management CM process managing full spectrum organization product facility process managing requirement including change assuring result conform requirement ICM
By definition CM also called includes process managing organization process procedure
Many organization characterized Level organization defined Software Engineering Institute Software Capability Maturity Model SEI
These Level organization rely heavily hero accomplish work
The organization process documented people know work accomplished
The software process characterized ad hoc occasionally even chaotic
Few process defined success depends individual effort heroic Paulk
An effective SCM program applied organizational process identifies process need documented
Any change process also tracked documented
Adhering process reduce organization dependence heroic work accomplished project succeed
It also relief frustration problem arise one hero available perform task
SCM essential discipline everyday activity defining requirement designing writing compiling testing documenting software
SCM simply version control format control
It clerical function
It technical field expertise formal practice
The benefit derived SCM directly proportional extent SCM implemented
The primary objective deliver quality product meet stated requirement schedule within budget
An effective SCM program support objective tracking requirement concept implementation customer delivery
The status accounting aspect SCM provides management visibility state software product
Status accounting data includes measurement see Chapter show location bottleneck software development process indicate maturity software product
Hermann describes use software change measure product maturity readiness deliver software
He go mention metric may useful including average severity severity level distribution average closure time chart severity level chart configuration item
A measure defined standard measurement extent dimension capacity anything especially determined standard act process measuring result measurement Starrett
Examples measure include number defect found release number source line code delivered
A metric defined calculated composite indicator based two measure quantified measure degree system component process posse given attribute
An example metric defect per thousand source line code Starrett
A metric also composite measure yield systematic insight state process product drive appropriate action Pitts
Measures measurement metric used identify area process require attention
These area identified compiling measurement metric
Measurements compiled electronic spreadsheet database hand
There also several management tool allow collection measurement derivation metric
The format issue data
A metric program include following fundamental Pitts Metrics used measure progress project quality product effort necessary complete project etc
One desired outcome compiling using metric improve process improvement product ratio
If change process yield increase production specific timeframe yield production decreased timeframe ratio improved
Another desired outcome increased customer satisfaction meeting requirement
For example defect software traced back incomplete faulty requirement definition requirement definition process reviewed increase clarity completeness requirement
The metric may help show customer need actively involved defining requirement clearly precisely
There many benefit gained organization practice SCM
Software developer tester project manager quality assurance QA personnel customer may benefit SCM
Benefits include SCM provides visibility status evolving software product
Software developer tester project manager quality assurance QA personnel customer benefit SCM information
SCM encompasses everyday task within organization whether software development maintenance
Software change identified controlled managed throughout project life cycle
The ten key SCM activity common development environment Platinum SCM divided following functional area shown Figure
Figure Functional Elements SCM Configuration identification see Chapter involves identifying structure software system uniquely identifying individual component making accessible form
The goal configuration identification ability identify component system throughout life cycle provide traceability software related software product
Identification answer Configuration identification activity include Figure present typical breakdown software distinct part present numbering scheme uniquely identifies component baseline release
The number left dot last baseline major release
The number right dot version since last baseline minor release
Normally new baseline major release number right dot zero
A hierarchical scheme used
Figure Software Configuration Identification Hierarchy Although key component managed requirement source code related documentation data identified placed SCM control
It important store track environment information support tool used throughout software life cycle ensure software reproduced
Items typically put SCM control include Kasse Effective configuration identification prerequisite configuration management activity configuration control status accounting audit use product configuration identification
If configuration item associated configuration documentation properly identified impossible control change item configuration establish accurate record report validate configuration audit
Inaccurate incomplete identification configured item configuration documentation may result defective product schedule delay higher maintenance cost delivery
Configuration change control involves controlling release change software product throughout software life cycle see Chapters
It perhaps visible element configuration management
It process manage preparation justification evaluation coordination disposition implementation proposed engineering change deviation affected configuration item baselined configuration documentation
The goal configuration change control establish mechanism help ensure production quality software well ensure version software contains necessary element element version work correctly together
A generic change process identified Figure
Figure Generic Change Process Berlack Configuration change control answer Configuration change control activity include Changes made configuration management baseline baselined software configuration item done according documented change control process
The change control process specify To control change made configuration item system many organization establish Software Configuration Control Board SCCB
This board review proposed change approves disapproves approved coordinate change affected group
Another key concept change control use baseline
A baseline specification product formally reviewed agreed upon thereafter serf basis development changed formal change procedure IEEE
When item baselined becomes frozen changed creating new version
Historically three different type baseline used functional allocated product
The functional baseline initially approved documentation describing functional characteristic verification required demonstrate achievement specified functional characteristic
The allocated baseline initially approved documentation describing interface requirement additional design constraint verification required demonstrate achievement specified functional interface characteristic
The product baseline initially approved documentation describing necessary functional physical characteristic designated production acceptance testing
Several additional informal baseline usually established software development process
The number type baseline depend model project implementing
model spiral incremental development rapid prototyping require flexibility establishment baseline
Configuration status accounting see Chapters involves recording reporting change process
The goal status accounting maintain continuous record status history baselined item proposed change
It includes report traceability change baseline throughout software life cycle Kasse
Configuration status accounting answer Configuration status accounting activity include Questions SCM status accounting able answer include Kasse Key information project configuration item communicated project member status accounting
Software engineer see fix file included baseline
Project manager track completion problem report various maintenance activity
Minimal report completed include transaction log change log item delta report
Other typically common report include resource usage stock status status configuration item change process deviation agreed upon
Configuration auditing see Chapters verifies software product built according requirement standard see Chapter contractual agreement
Test report documentation used verify software meet stated requirement
The goal configuration audit verify software product produced correctly identified described change request resolved according established SCM process procedure
Informal audit conducted key phase software life cycle
There two type formal audit conducted software delivered customer functional configuration audit FCA physical configuration audit PCA
FCA verifies software satisfies software requirement stated System Requirements Specification Interface Requirements Specification
That FCA allows one validate system requirement
The PCA determines whether design reference document represent software built
Configuration audit answer Configuration audit activity include One first step successfully implementing SCM obtain management sponsorship
This mean public endorsement SCM making sure resource needed success allocated project
Management also need establish SCM priority help facilitate implementation
An organization maintain management sponsorship identifying resolving risk reporting progress managing SCM implementation detail communicating member organization
The next step ass current SCM process
Every organization produce software practicing type SCM
This may formal process even thought SCM
To ass current process one might ask following question After assessing current process next step analyze requirement
What organization want accomplish
The requirement may specific level certification ISO certification standard certification simply improve software process
Document requirement organization implement measure success
Depending requirement organization various role formality SCM team may differ
At minimum SCM
Other recommended role function include With new software project process amount associated risk
The true implementing SCM
Whether organization implementing whole new system updating process risk must addressed
Note risk bad contrary risk necessary part SCM software development process
Without risk opportunity improvement
SCM process typically little use
The nature SCM requires
Managing controlling risk associated SCM essential success SCM process term cost schedule quality
It always le expensive aware deal risk respond unexpected problem
A risk analyzed resolved ahead time much easier deal one surface unexpectedly Guidelines
The Software Engineering Institute developed risk management program comprising six different activity communication central
This program used implementing SCM effectively manage associated risk
Risk management viewed important part SCM process
A brief summary activity follows Paulk As part organization risk management program plan developed integrates outlined activity

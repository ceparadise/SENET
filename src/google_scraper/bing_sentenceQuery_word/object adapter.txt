The adapter pattern used client class call incompatible provider class
Let imagine MailingClient class need call method LegacyEmployee class already call class implement interface implement
We could add new method implement interface legacy code ca changed
We could modify class call need change every call
The formatting code would duplicated everywhere
Moreover wo able call provider class implement interface
So solution code formatting code another independent class adapter also called implement interface
call
format data call
This type adapter called
The type adapter
Describe class adapter
The JavaScript library implement adapter pattern
This library used canvas element
The canvas element two interface WebGL
The first one simple use second much complex optimized faster
The WebGL interface interface client call interface
Think twice implementing pattern
This pattern planned design time
If plan use project scratch mean understand pattern
It used legacy code
It least bad solution
Its implementation easy expensive
You refactor code client provider able work together yet
This worst part
Most code redundancy le without pattern
The modern interface always provide much information legacy interface need work
If one information missing modern interface call pattern question
This pattern easily removed automatic refactoring operation easily remove existence
Our company created merger
One list employee available database access via class One list employee available LDAP access via class To access former employee company A former employee company B define interface used two adapter We create adapter code former company A We create adapter code former company B Add illustration

In also known Wrapper alternative naming shared allows existing used another interface
It often used make existing class work others without modifying
An example adapter convert interface document tree structure displayed
The Adapter design pattern one describe solve recurring design problem design flexible reusable software object easier implement change test reuse
Often already existing class ca reused interface conform interface client require
The key idea pattern work separate adapts interface already existing class without changing
Clients know whether work class directly class interface
See also UML class diagram
An adapter allows two incompatible interface work together
This definition adapter
Interfaces may incompatible inner functionality suit need
The Adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible class work together converting interface one class interface expected client
An adapter used wrapper must respect particular interface must support behavior
Alternatively make possible add alter behavior interface used easier simpler interface underlying object desired
In class requires depends interface reuse class directly interface conform interface
Instead work class implement interface term In adapter pattern adapter contains instance class wrap
In situation adapter make call instance wrapped
This adapter pattern us multiple implementing inheriting interface expected interface
It typical expected interface created pure class especially jdk support class
There form runtime adapter pattern follows It desired supply data let u suppose data
A compile time solution However suppose format string data must varied
A compile time solution use inheritance perhaps create correctly formatting object runtime mean
A solution using adapter proceeds follows Define intermediary Provider interface write implementation Provider interface wrap source data example output data formatted appropriate ii Write Adapter class return specific implementation Provider iii Register global registry looked runtime iv In code wishing transfer data write concisely v The advantage seen desired transfer data second format look different vi And desired output data say image data vii In way use adapter provider allows multiple view without alter class hierarchy
In general permit mechanism arbitrary data flow object retrofitted existing object hierarchy
When implementing adapter pattern clarity one apply class name provider implementation example
It constructor method adaptee class variable parameter
This parameter passed instance member
When clientMethod called access adaptee instance allows accessing required data adaptee performing operation data generates desired output

How decide use object adapter use class adapter
Problem statement To create social networking web site provide import functionality facebook google plus orkut
I unable decide whether use object adapter class adapter
I look could understand essence difference
The main difference us wrap
It wrap interface since definition must derive base class
us wrap class interface
It since contains private encapsulated member class interface wrap
The difference subtle
Usually later approach favoring preferable explained link I quote Programing OOP well known candidate reuse functionality Inheritance whitebox reuse Composition blackbox reuse
If try reuse code inheriing class make subclass dependent parent class
This make system many case unnecessarily complex le testable make exchange functionality run time unnecessarily hard
As Clean Code Developer follow need decide inheritance appropriate
Composition mean one class us another
You promote decoupling defining interface clearly
That also give advantage implementation easily replaced
So start applying Liskov Substitution pronciple think Favour Composition Inheritance concept ask yourselve prefer composition right away
Because inheritance expose subclass detail implementation often said break encapsulation
Gang Four Object adapter Class Adapter In Simple word us Subclassing us delegation using composition
Example Above example Class Adapter
We adapted MyExistingServiceClass ClientInterface calling existing show method inside implementation display
To convert object adapter code like Now use Object adapter place Class Adatper When way subclass class going adapted per client interface
Examples like MyExistingServiceClass declared final
When client expects contract inteface abstract class implementation
In case way subclass client expected class ca subclass one class way using class adapted composition
When need adapt one object
Such case directly working object adapted
A good example would JTable class
This class creates GUI graphical user interface table component filled information adapter feed
To display data domain JTable provides constructor accept instance TableModel defined
JDK provides existing abstract implementation TableModel AbstractTableModel
Here adapted MyDomainObject order used AbstractTableModel
A class adapter us multiple inheritance adapt one interface another depending programming language Java C support multiple inheritance An object adapter depends object composition Images Source Design Pattern Elements Reusable Software book By posting answer agree

An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

Marketing Technology Management I believe future computer science least branch marketing department
And vice versa
Marketing department need hire computer science grad
Computer science researcher need work marketing problem
And golden age prosperity awaiting discipline collaboration
Let explain three point
I privilege hear talk MIT last month
For without computer science background Papadimitriou legend sort Brett Favre football one master
The theme talk computer science new math
By meant computer science longer branch science much tool adopted science
He gave example physic biology social science algorithmic lens computer science enabled incredible breakthrough past several year
With Internet particular understanding people behave online individually group
And computer science marketing collide
Social networking dynamic critical concern marketer living incarnation graph theory problem computer science
Improving effectiveness advertising leveraging people pattern preference challenge optimization algorithm
Computational problem marketing sounding like theoretical computer science dissertation
The inspiration blog realization marketing becoming centered around technological channel method yet time marketing whole still rather technologically deficient DNA
No offense intended marketer simply focused area expertise
Previously marketing could rely IT vendor make happen without prying closely cover
Unfortunately Platonic separation tech marketing grows le tenable every day
The success digital marketing initiative often inexorably tied detail implementation
The diversity technology marketing sphere today campaign management search engine bidding web analytics lead automation staggering
New category marketing application seem arise every year social marketing management anyone
Decisions selecting right package platform fall marketer shoulder along challenge maintenance customization integration weave together
Think daunting
may around corner bag chip
If know marketing technology real competitive edge
If blow lot time money little show
The stake high
Marketing become tech savvy
I saying marketer need computer scientist
Just marketer need creatives
But aesthetic creative talent graphic design copywriting absorbed marketing gestalt must talent algorithm architecture
even emanates small percentage team
I read Computerworld least US
This alarming microeconomic macroeconomic level industry academia
Unless reading India China case future bright
Part reason I think interest computer science degree waned among college student image career prospect
Not oversimplify CS grad typically two career option outside academia software product development epitomized many getting job engineering Microsoft Google next hottest IT managing system software inside organization
The former remains exciting promise however elusively Internet age fame fortune
But many job competition extremely fierce
Out class CS grad many Microsoft Google take
IT career hand viscerally appealing many teenager
You hear exclaim I want work IT It good work important work necessary work work
And definitely room star rise
But maybe much career
Some perception reality
Marketing sexy though
Part solution inspiring computer science major develop elevates talent skill demand generation growth glory reward offer
Joint membership
I think future

As I going get link Computerworld I happened see ad Worcester Polytechnic Institute
Maybe future far away
This obviously one great post
Thanks valuable information insight provided
Keep
Aurelius thanks kind comment encouragement
Was visiting blog love latest cartoon I Internet marketer What
I situation hundred time
Love post
I currently Digital Marketing Manager also Comp Sci student

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

If American might benefit insight work
HBR recently commented CMOs larger IT budget CIOs company
Marketing increasingly field online marketing grows exponentially compared channel technical solution manage use information gathered
That good point

That solid hint industry going prevalent technical solution going marketing soon

Agreed
If want earn major comp sci minor marketing
I agree earning
As recently graduated marketing major I find I learned marketing class I remember use
A lot curriculum practice
Now I left wishing I hard skill field comp sci I may go grab AA web something
I got associate video game scripting bachelor business management elective marketing like consumer behavior working quite well unique
That bit assumption care explain
I sure average salary developer average salary marketer look trend growth
Marketing avg starting salary college marketing major Average salary Comp Sci major college Average Salary IT major college Salary Marketing Salary Comp Sci Salary IT Science CS avg starting Salary avg salary Systems IS avg starting Salary avg salary Information Systems CIS avg starting Salary avg salary Technology IT avg starting Salary avg salary avg starting Salary avg mid career Salary Communications avg starting salary avg salary Granted I grabbed stats online minute tend appears
The point industry average marketing field filled worker company sort patch marketing operation spam call center similar operation
You find bottom rank marketing department many company staffed people significant marketing skill qualification
On hand ca really programmer programming skill
These job stacked people qualification even low end spectrum
So keeping mind marketing professional studied profession solid paid comparably comp sci people
Also worth noting marketing professional higher career glass ceiling
Development go far marketing professional drive experience get better access position purely marketing put touch strategic planning issue technical operation
It well could I entirely sure stats
However ca really argue growth comp
sci related field
As I noted I quickly looked online
As I agree glass ceiling higher look new enormous IPO type company startup looking exit people tech guy one way another
So low ceiling say Twitter Fab
In end course make money field exceptional field
I bullish programming developer near future
Note I one Its also worth noting two really mutually exclusive marketer developer vice versa granted normally think two together CRM big data engine well field really coming
Agreed development marketing much similar seems
In field people capable lateral thinking creative problem solving highly sought
The idea developer linear code crunchers anyone favour mostly propagated people never bothered understand development
As glass ceiling take
Most tech startup founded developer short hiring people one break profitability acquisition potential one developer
It feature spec sell fact address tangible market done good job communicating value
Also marketing go digital basic HTML CSS even scripting becoming important old skillsets copywriting speaking design
In last year I chug countless line HTMLs CSS slap together simple Python VBscript work database etc
I figure company marketing department bigger people specialist generalist
And today generalist surrounded hipster ascot database analytics multivariate testing UX statistical forecasting
Totally agree savvy investor going acquire startup proof concept minimum
And sort rare see business savvy developer though I think change significantly near future simply due possible paycheck field
I say I think historically development related field attracted people drawn certainty working computer
What I mean write code correctly going work remind accountant way
Marketing least topically seems interesting volatile many way draw different market people pardon pun
As I noted though I think may change development continues evolution
And yes person must laterally communicative problem I faced developer past much moreso socially inclined profession able effectively integrate one discipline truly sought marketplace reason
I mean many great developer simply know market useful code many great developer know market appealing wide market code
As anything else cream rise top
And spot last paragraph fact I think even anything exceptionally many field day quickly learn next thing technology progressing exponentially seem slowing
academic never business made profit
As person two degree previously worked university year founded company since leaving public sector I aprove question
Most academic ever academia since age
Internet marketing ad exchange etc Also consider stats minor CS elective
Taking relational database class learning SQL league ahead others getting market research database marketing email campaign clickstream data SEO
However actually analyzing campaign attributing ROI looking like marketing bos involve heavy stats work
Minor CS skill stats knowledge marketing skill going game changing skill set marketing manager
Marketing major comp sci minor starting salary anywhere
So yes
That combo I would done I go back time fewyears I could live true As noted reverse two may better financially however want love
Because hard something hate good enough one best

However follow one single piece advice

In either case technical knowledge leg colleague enter field pick technical side fly

Requirement Traceability matrix map user requirement test case
In simple word matrix help determining requirement covered test case traced back requirement
There type RTM Please refer following link better understanding ability trace forward backward requirement end product end product back requirement
It mean tracing code requirement throughout Software Development Life Cycle SDLC
When course project fundamental aim would ensure every requirement translated code
Tracing right requirement architecture design code ensure objective precisely requirement met referred process establishing Forward Traceability
A well maintained requirement documentation like RTM guide process
When think maintenance invariably due economic technical consideration client come back
At juncture debug rather hunt various type bug
You position go back requirement corresponding code architectural component
To achieve ought trace back code design corresponding requirement
This process called Backward Traceability
You read entire traceability process Some definition A specified association pair artifact one comprising source one comprising target artifact
It effectively bidirectional
Where concept directionality given implemented referred solely association
When trace link traversed source target used
Where link semantics provided provide way traversal
When trace link traversed target source used
Where link semantics may longer valid
term used refer fact trace link used primary reverse link direction
Here may achieved
Bidirectional traceability need implemented forward backward requirement end product end product back requirement
When requirement managed well traceability established source requirement lower level requirement lower level requirement back source
Such bidirectional traceability help determine source requirement completely addressed lower level requirement traced valid source

A document usually form table used assist determining completeness relationship correlating two using relationship comparison
It often used often consist marketing requirement detailed product matching part detailed design
A requirement traceability matrix may used check current project requirement met help creation various deliverable document project plan task
Common usage take identifier item one document place left column
The identifier document placed across top row
When item left column related item across top mark placed intersecting cell
The number relationship added row column
This value indicates mapping two item
Zero value indicate relationship exists
It must determined relationship must made
Large value imply relationship complex simplified
To ease creation traceability matrix advisable add relationship source document backward traceability forward traceability
That way item changed one easy see need changed

It basically table establishes connectivity Requirements testcases
Was answer useful
It traceability matrix link required testcases respective requirement well functional spec design spec
It bidirectional mostly happens instead writing actual requirement functional specification table write corresponding column
hyperlink click take respective page also change done document need change RTM

Software production activity also known software development process improving due demand quality increase product
The demand quality cost decrease added introduction new technology naturally force process improvement
Those fact new occurs several production area employ different technique increase development process
In particular software research area involved process improvement Software Engineering Bauer IEEE IEEE
The first model ever employed software development process proposed work segmentation waterfall model
It able allow structured overview software development structure foundation stone propose new process new necessity required
There development model prototyping incremental evolutionary spiral
It interesting observe common point model start Requirements Engineering
Generally speaking Requirements Engineering process identify stakeholder need documenting way make analysis communication subsequent implementation feasible time leading product quality reliability Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The fact Requirements Engineering first activity within software production process better explored analyzing following statement Antoniou et
Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The first statement refers definition purpose inherent characteristic initial activity project research methodology Basili et Solingen Berghout
The second refers meet intended purpose
If software development basis come solution given problem fundamental importance knowledge exact dimension problem solved
Requirements initially discovered project understand basic condition next phase
Thus one get idea importance respect requirement Requirements Engineering occurs initial phase within development process
Requirements engineering activity divided five category Elicitation Analysis Negotiation Documentation Validation Management
These definition alternate among different author Jarke Pohl Sawyer et Graham Kotonya Sommerville Sommerville concept similar Individuals organization involved affected system influence requirement
They could manager supplier customer
The process identification analysis documentation management requirement useful implementation consistent need stakeholder provide software product quality
The main resource used maintain represent traceability relationship
A link establishes explicit relationship two artifact
Technical managerial procedure aid evaluation improvement software development process
The ability define trace requirement artifact throughout development process follow trace direction
A set element describing something built purpose subject particular form analysis
A parallel process support requirement engineering activity identification change management requirement traceability throughout development process

within
Traceability general term defined IEEE Systems Software Engineering Vocabulary degree relationship established two product development process especially product relationship one another identification documentation derivation path upward allocation flowdown path downward work product work product hierarchy degree element software development product establishes reason existing discernable association among two logical entity requirement system element verification task
Requirements traceability particular defined ability describe follow life requirement forward backwards direction origin development specification subsequent deployment use period ongoing refinement iteration phase
In requirement engineering field traceability understanding requirement objective goal aim aspiration expectation need transformed requirement
It therefore primarily concerned satisfaction relationship layer information aka artefact
However traceability may document relationship many kind development artefact requirement specification statement design test model developed component
For example common practice capture verification relationship demonstrate requirement verified certain test artefact
Traceability especially relevant developing system therefore prescribed
A common requirement guideline critical requirement must verified verification must demonstrated traceability

Requirements come different source like business person ordering product marketing manager actual user
These people different requirement product
Using requirement traceability implemented feature traced back person group wanted
This used development process prioritize requirement determining valuable requirement specific user
It also used deployment user study show feature used see required first place

Not requirement traced also requirement relationship artefact associated model analysis result test case test procedure test result documentation kind
Even people user group associated requirement traceable
Requirements realized design artefact implementation finally verified
Artefacts tied latter stage traced back requirement well
This typically done via requirement
Establishing traceability beyond requirement design implementation verification artefact become difficult
When implementing software requirement instance requirement may tool design artefact may tool
In case including little project requirement may included MS Word PDF document managed tool like
Furthermore implementation artefact likely form source file link established various way various scope
Verification artefact generated internal test formal verification tool Repository tool stack integration present significant challenge maintaining traceability dynamic system
The usage traceability especially tracing beyond requirement artefact located tool chain bring several benefit A complete overview development activity supported traceability relevance given
Extensive study document effectiveness also difficulty capturing traceability information One goal traceability visualize relationship artefact
As number complexity trace link increase technique traceability visualization necessary
A visualization include information artefact
artefact type metadata attribute link
link typ metadata link strength
Common visualization traceability information
Visualizations combined overcome specific limitation
Traceability realized capturing trace either entirely manual tool supported
spreadsheet
Though widely applied process cumbersome often lead traceability information insufficient quality due various involved development tool typically high number artefact traced
traceability requires development information distributed across whole chain development tool homogenized aggregated
The following approach exist reaching state tool chain cover whole system manage artefact development process holistic approach
Issue tracker implementing requirement template used successfully distributed environment
The advantage approach homogenization artefact allows manage analyze easily dedicated tool tool
The disadvantage necessary implement whole tool chain
If introduced difficult replace specific tool tool chain
RM tool allow storing organizing managing requirement system specification typically arrange link requirement parent requirement higher specification
Commercial RM tool traceability support Cradle CASE Spec
Freely available tool
Typical analysis function based recorded traceability information completeness check
system level requirement go equipment level without modification assessment requirement deviation level qualification status presentation
In order ensure traceability artefact type beyond requirement RM tool often allow import artefact surrogate requirement traced tool requirement tracing method
For example element model imported surrogate module related requirement
The disadvantage approach different adapter converter different artefact type necessary need consistent version data format
In contrast ALM tool consistency must carried oneself

This tutorial demonstrates different system utility application enable computerto perform better
The tutorial cover following area installing window update deleting temporary internet file removing unused program installing scheduling anti virus software running Disk Cleanup Disk Defrag checking device driver increasing virtual memory
I hope find useful please leave feedback

If treat computer right stay fast responsive many year
But neglect proper maintenance turn molasses machine end source frustration
In worst case especially true laptop
They extremely effective require close zero effort part cost dime
The incredible using already install right away
No matter think wasted disk space system
And exact opposite surprised much disk space actually wasted
We talking gigabyte
Here hard part disk space management average Windows system hundred thousand file folder
This make difficult pinpoint
Cleaning Downloads folder first obvious step
Your system likely filled kind forgotten file longer need file likely scattered around system
Good luck hunting one one
If value time use WinDirStat instead
It scan drive turn browsable hierarchy make easy see folder using space drive
Afterwards check
As use computer certain file want delete regular basis
This includes browser cache temporary installer file Windows thumbnail system log file crash dump etc
Doing hand simply unfeasible
The file cleaner feature CCleaner two section one Windows one application
Go check uncheck kind file want clean click Run Cleaner
I ran freed GB disk space
Even though Pro version necessary
You may want consider upgrading however interested deeper scanning system monitoring scheduled cleaning automatic update
Upgrading cost
Did know uninstalling app Windows usually leaf trace app still system
It rather annoying trace add time resulting wasted space even impact system performance
Geek Uninstaller simple use uninstall app scan system related file may left behind remove
It fast portable meaning run computer needed
If Geek Uninstaller bit simple great alternative
The free version slightly powerful couple extra feature find Geek also bit slower overall
Malware always always
Best case slows system crawl
Worst case PC data
Malwarebytes absolute best app currently get free
Its database infection updated every day successfully detect remove latest virus worm spyware
The free version manual full scan adequate
The premium version add protection well support per year
Think like preemptive vaccine whereas free version like treatment
Do know exact spec CPU GPU RAM storage motherboard part computer
If remember month
Or even year
I know I tend forgetful thing
Speccy tell important bit need know computer glance
Some even get pretty depth information panel CPU RAM storage
This app particularly useful want want compare available market
If like Speccy whatever reason good alternative
It advanced Speccy report detail ever need therefore good enough percent time
I consider five tool essential installs regardless kind computer kind user
I also want throw two apps even though one If Windows note differ previous version Windows
And matter version Windows want best
Required field marked I might naive
I love HP Chromebook
It eliminates use cool Maintenance Tools D Are u still living
u need ccleaner u optipn clicking left drive c clean temporary file option
dont second software
One go dont install another using window defender
wont benefit
ccleaner clean temporary file partition
seems like used ccleaner want appear smart
clicking left drive c clean temporary file option LOL delusional
sound like even used software mentioned article
Lol antivirus software automatically disable window defender install
used Malwarebytes I recommend everyone
Even free version great CCleaner Revo
These swear Please stop republishing article year ago current date comment
It annoying Hell excellent way drive people away
good topic information clean slate comment
Mike right Stop
This information year old bloody age talking software
Hi Frank article rewritten updated
Are still seeing old version
Hi Frank article rewritten updated fo Hi Mike
This article rewritten prior republishing evidenced new screenshots text
If still seeing old article may cache issue
Good point comment though
We discus approach internally thanks
Yes
Please look ancient comment updating I would remove
I would also make note original publishing date notation article updated reflect current information
Otherwise look like old article potential interest got bumped front
Thanks There comment
They cached phone yr old
helpful answer faster way test paper
Microsoft Security Essentials software worked great year window computer
It free easy work
It total bullshit see
Rule trust M security
CCleaner great tool I used really worked well util
found Adware Sumo Gen let yr I pas piece software
Haha
American product American product known specially high quality would court treason producing utter shit claiming good
If someone level ca conf make something work caused total bullshit
Spybot accompany Malwarebytes good I think Malwarebytes would Antivirus
Spyware Combofix Spybot great article
Spyware Combofix Spybot great article
I think Secunia PSI another great tool Wise Registry Cleaner Glary Utilities Auslogics Disk Defrag great addition list
Would love see equivalent article Mac user
SUMO updater IMHO one best software updaters available cover lot software false positive compared software I
FileHippo update checker good job seems cover major software
SUMO updater IMHO one best software updaters available cover lot software false positive compared software I

modification software product delivery correct fault improve performance attribute
A common perception maintenance merely involves fixing
However one study indicated maintenance effort used action
This perception perpetuated user submitting problem report reality functionality enhancement system
More recent study put proportion closer
Software maintenance system first addressed
Over period twenty year research led formulation Lehman
Key finding research include maintenance really evolutionary development maintenance decision aided understanding happens system software time
Lehman demonstrated system continue evolve time
As evolve grow complex unless action taken reduce complexity
In late famous widely cited survey study Lientz Swanson exposed high fraction expended maintenance
They categorized maintenance activity four class The survey showed around maintenance effort first two type error correction consumed
Many subsequent study suggest similar magnitude problem
Studies show contribution end user crucial new requirement data gathering analysis
And main cause problem software evolution maintenance
So software maintenance important consumes large part overall lifecycle cost also inability change software quickly reliably mean business opportunity lost
An integral part software maintenance one requires accurate maintenance plan prepared software development
It specify user request modification report problem
The budget include resource cost estimate
A new decision addressed developing every new system feature quality objective
The software maintenance last year even decade development process call effective plan address scope software maintenance tailoring post process designation provide maintenance estimate cost
The selection proper enforcement standard challenging task right early stage software engineering got definite importance concerned stakeholder
This section describes six software maintenance process There number process activity practice unique maintainer example
Swanson initially identified three category maintenance corrective adaptive perfective
The standard superseded June
These since updated present There also notion maintenance good thing lower total cost ownership software
Things like compliance coding standard includes software maintainability goal
The management coupling cohesion software
The attainment software supportability goal SAE example
Note also academic institution carrying research quantify cost ongoing software maintenance due lack resource design document comprehension training resource multiply cost approx
design data available
Impact key adjustment factor maintenance sorted order maximum positive impact Not module troublesome many factor degrade performance
For example complex spaghetti code quite difficult maintain safely
A common situation often degrades performance lack suitable maintenance tool defect tracking software change management software test library software
Below describe factor range impact software maintenance
Impact key adjustment factor maintenance sorted order maximum negative impact

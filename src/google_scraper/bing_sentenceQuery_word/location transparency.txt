Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In distributed system theory I found definition distributed system requires among others location access transparency
I wondering location transparency already include access transparency
two follows Access transparency Regardless resource access representation performed individual computing entity user distributed system always access resource single uniform way
Location transparency Users distributed system aware resource physically located
If I become aware resource physically located automatically imply I able access resource uniform way
If yes could leave access transparency definition without changing meaning
There certainly strong dependency two property many example point conclusion
Think API need use operation access local remote file
If already list file unaware physical location URL since retrieved file retrieved ftp
It imply used mean retrieve list file
But entirely true
Let simplify Wikipedia definition enables resource accessed
enables resource accessed
This form transparency necessary since refer different architectural layer
The refers application layer whereas refers physical layer
Returning initial example access list file using API entirely sure list retrieved file located retrieved

In computer network use name identify resource rather actual location
For example file accessed unique file name actual data stored physical sector scattered around disk either local computer network
In location transparency system actual location file stored matter user
A need employ networked scheme naming resource
The main benefit location transparency longer matter resource located
Depending network set user may able obtain file reside another computer connected particular network
This mean location resource matter either software developer
This creates illusion entire system located single computer greatly simplifies software development
An additional benefit flexibility provides
Systems resource moved different computer time without disrupting software system running
By simply updating location go named resource every program using resource able find
Location transparency effectively make location easy use user since data accessed almost everyone connect Internet know right file name usage proper security credential access

Any change system new feature new component system change adheres previous much possible changing internal behaviour
The purpose shield change system human user end interface
Confusingly term refers overall component refer
The term widely used computing marketing substitution term since term bad usually seen something user ca see control term good connotation usually associated hiding anything
The vast majority time term used misleading way refer actual invisibility computing process
Because misleading definition modern computer literature tends prefer use agnostic transparent
The term used particularly often regard invisible either upper lower neighbouring layer
Also temporarily used later around IBM Honeywell programming manual term referred certain technique
An application code transparent clear detail management contained logic solving main problem
It achieved putting code module internal detail making invisible main application
For example transparent introduces access file stored remotely network way uniform previous local access user might even notice using folder hierarchy
The early FTP considerably le transparent requires user learn access file client
Similarly file system allow transparent decompression data enabling user store file medium without special knowledge file system encrypt file transparently
This approach require running compression encryption utility manually
In also considered good practice develop use abstraction layer access application work different database abstraction layer allows part program access database transparently see example
In transparency facilitated use hide actual implementation done different underlying
Transparency mean form hide distributed nature user appearing functioning normal centralized system
There many type transparency Formal definition concept found Open Distributed Processing Reference Model ISO
The degree property achieved may vary widely
Not every system hide everything user
For instance due existence fixed finite always latency accessing resource distant user
If one expects interaction distributed system may noticeable

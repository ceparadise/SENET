In set stored storage location denoted word copy value variable
In assignment statement expression fundamental construct
Today commonly used notation basic operation come originally Superplan popularized followed originally popularised although many notation use
In language symbol used regarded meaning assignment value others define assignment statement meaning used expression
Assignments typically allow variable hold different value different time
However language primarily allow kind destructive reassignment might imply change state
The purpose enforce
function depend state variable produce result given set parametric input point time
Modern program language also often use similar strategy although le strict certain part order reduce complexity normally conjunction complementing methodology
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed purely functional language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent reassignment allowed
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available purely functional language variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include data structure var accepts multiple assignment value equal contrast Haskell dataflow variable cell data structure like list symbol vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate represented
This type one possible value therefore containing information
It typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
Certain use pattern common thus often special syntax support
These primarily reduce redundancy source code also simplify compilation clarifying programmer intent easing analysis source code
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant provide special operator called like instead written
Beyond syntactic sugar simplifies compilation since make clear modification variable possible
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
Chained assignment equivalent sequence assignment evaluation strategy differs language
For simple chained assignment like initializing multiple variable evaluation strategy matter target assignment connected way evaluation strategy affect result
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment expression value
In case chain assignment implemented assignment happen
For example equivalent
In also available value class type declaring appropriate return type assignment operator
In assignment statement expression thus value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
This essentially equivalent though actual variable produced temporary value
Some programming language since allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
This often known introduced name sometimes called though confusing used single assignment opposite
If side assignment single variable
array structure feature called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly swap value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Some language Go Python combine parallel assignment tuples automatic allow multiple return value single function Python example This provides alternative use returning multiple value function
This date CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally
In C similar parallel assignment allowing multiple assignment occur within single statement writing instead
This primarily used replaced parallel assignment language Go
However code ensure perfect simultaneity since right side following code evaluated left side
In language Python assign two variable concurrently using initial value compute new b
The use equal sign assignment operator frequently criticized due conflict equal comparison equality
This result confusion novice writing code confusion even experienced programmer reading code
The use equal assignment date back language designed particularly popularized Fortran A notorious example bad idea choice equal sign denote assignment
It go back Fortran blindly copied army language designer
Why bad idea
Because overthrow century old tradition let denote comparison equality predicate either true false
But Fortran made mean assignment enforcing equality
In case operand unequal footing The left operand variable made equal right operand expression
x mean thing x
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C including one famous attempt backdoor Linux kernel assignment operator also return value assigned way function return value validly nested inside expression
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
The two common representation copying assignment
Both form may semantically denote either assignment assignment also value depending language usage
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Mathematical assignment generally depicted
Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix postfix syntax statement including assignment

In mathematics sometimes computer programming operator represents action example arithmetic operator represents multiplication
In computer program one familiar set operator operator used work value
Boolean operator include AND OR NOT AND NOT NEAR
These variation XOR used You may used Boolean operator entering phrase search engine require operator capitalized find information
Among type operator used computer programming assign specified value another value compare two value

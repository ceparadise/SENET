If student want pursue Computer Science generally three way
Computer Science BSC CS Bachelor Computer Application BCA Bachelor Technology Computer Science BTech CS If compare three volume BCA BSC CS BTech CS BCA BTech CS BSC CS depending College university
To pursue BCA join Science Commerce Arts background
But pursue BTech BSC CS need solid background mathematics
The main diffence BSC CS BCA BCS CS concept oriented It teach Core Concept computer science help learn anything new quickly hand BCA application oriented teach current technology learning new technoloigies working Core Computing difficult
There misconception BSC teach programming language I I learned C Java PHP SQL
Also I got Good Practical knowledge Electronics Microprocessor
In BSc I learned Microprocessors Automata Compilers Data Structure Analog Digital Electronics Networking Discrete Mathematics Graph Theory
In BCA teach topic detailed way
BSC CS General Course BCA Technical Course getting job BCA easy BSC CS
After BSC CS MSC CS MCA
But BCA MCA
MSC CS You get knowledge Core Computer Science like Parallal Computing Artifical Intelligence Soft Computing Information Security
MCA Not much change BCA lot student Mathematics Physics join course
After MSC MCA able MTech MTech need atleast Years Education There way directly go MTech BSC CS BCA
contains concept thesis fundamental computer one need know entering computer field
Subjects like mathematics boolean algebra equation solving graph microprocessor achitecture history computer generation computer etc part course
But BSc wo provide technical knowledge particular technology like Java Oracle etc
They would touch technological product like MSOffice Java never detail
Thus BSc alone may sufficient degree get good job computer industry require specialization technology
Though data entry job job would available
BSc general syllabus said specialized course
In BSc theoretical aspect going covered
hand technical knowledge inclusion programming language like Java C DS Databases MySQL Oracle etc
Thus one may get decent job company even directly getting BCA degree
Go link specific The CS course mainly focus mathematical theoretical foundation computing rather teaching specific technology may quickly become outdated
The course prepares higher education
BCA professionally oriented prepares research work also creates professional manpower problem solving application computer science interface business technology Still question
Ask

There many definition Computer Science
However consensus Computer Science central concept algorithm
An algorithm set instruction performed computer solve problem
Computer Science defined science Thus Computer Science involves carefully analysing problem organisation individual face order arrive algorithmic solution problem
This solution linguistically realised turned program executed computer system
Clearly also mean design computer system execute program important Computer Science
Finally many problem allow one algorithmic solution final important aspect Computer Science concern technique comparing different algorithm
These technique include theoretical tool require good understanding Mathematics well empirical comparison different algorithm task
The Computer Science undergraduate programme aim The intended learning outcome divided two class namely intended learning undergraduate programme science subject intended learning outcome specific Computer Science
The general intended learning outcome student Specific learning outcome student In order Computer Science Degree candidate must satisfy requirement entrance Faculty Pure Applied Science
Students must either The undergraduate programme Faculty Pure Applied Sciences divided two part level course
These shown table along Computer Science course code level
Students allowed proceed Part II programme unless passed
The
Computer Science programme normally take three year
There programme department
Most class offered regular hour
However first year course offered evening
Some lab may also offered Saturdays
For student began programme Semester I major Computer Science requires credit Part II Computer Science course
These must include For student began Computer Science programme please click degree requirement
A minor Computer Science requires sixteen credit Part II Computer Science course
These must include following four core course The Department Computing offer following track
Computer Science degree A Computing graduate Hardware Interfacing Embedded Systems track expected Students track expected take addition course required department

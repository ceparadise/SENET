Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In formal naming definition type property interrelationship really exist particular
Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO
ontology considered upper ontology used linguistic tool learning domain ontology
The ontology example combination upper domain ontology
A survey ontology visualization technique presented Katifori et al
The established ontology visualization technique namely indented tree graph evaluated Fu et al
A visual language ontology represented specified
also called ontology building set task related development ontology particular domain
It subfield study ontology development process ontology life cycle method methodology building ontology tool language support
Ontology engineering aim make explicit knowledge contained software application organizational procedure particular domain
Ontology engineering offer direction overcoming semantic obstacle related definition business term software class
Known challenge ontology engineering include application designed assist creation manipulation
They often express ontology one many
Some provide export ontology language however
Among relevant criterion choosing ontology editor degree editor abstract actual used visual navigation possibility within
Next come facility support etc
Another important feature ability import export foreign language
Ontologies developed specific purpose application
Ontology learning automatic creation ontology including extracting domain term natural language text
As building ontology manually extremely time consuming great motivation automate process
Information extraction text mining explored automatically link ontology document example context BioCreative challenge
An used encode ontology

Semesters Major Majeure Minor Mineure

In semantic system concept ontology used search result contextual meaning input query instead keyword matching
From research literature seems need tool provide easy interface complex query natural language retrieve information ontology
This research paper proposes IRSCSD system Information retrieval system computer science domain solution
This system offer advanced querying browsing structured data search result automatically aggregated rendered directly consistent thus reducing manual effort user
So main objective research design development semantic system integrating ontology towards retrieval support
Methodology followed piecemeal research involves following stage
First Stage involves designing framework semantic system
Second stage build prototype framework using tool
Third Stage deal natural language query conversion SPARQL query language using QUEPY framework
Fourth Stage involves firing converted SPARQL query ontology Apache Jena API fetch result
Lastly evaluation prototype done order ensure efficiency usability
Thus research paper throw light framework development semantic system assist efficient retrieval information natural language query interpretation semantic web language creation ontology mapping related ontology
This research paper also provides approach metric ontology evaluation prototype ontology developed study performance based accessibility required information

Ontology Ling Liu Tamer Eds
ontology semantic data model ontological engineering In context computer information science defines set representational primitive model domain knowledge discourse
The representational primitive typically class set attribute property relationship relation among class member
The definition representational primitive include information meaning constraint logically consistent application
In context database system ontology viewed level abstraction data model analogous hierarchical relational model intended modeling knowledge individual attribute relationship individual
Ontologies typically specified language allow abstraction away data structure implementation strategy practice language ontology closer expressive power logic language used model database
For reason ontology said semantic level whereas database schema model data logical physical level
Due independence lower level data model ontology used integrating heterogeneous database enabling interoperability among disparate system specifying interface independent service
In technology stack Semantic Web standard ontology called explicit layer
There standard language variety commercial open source tool creating working ontology
The term ontology come field philosophy concerned study existence
In philosophy one talk theory nature existence Aristotle ontology offer primitive category substance quality presumed account All That Is
In computer information science ontology technical term denoting artifact purpose enable modeling knowledge domain real imagined
The term adopted early Artificial Intelligence AI researcher recognized applicability work mathematical logic argued AI researcher could create new ontology computational model enable certain kind automated reasoning
In AI community came use term ontology refer theory modeled world Physics component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early effort create interoperability standard identified technology stack called ontology layer standard component knowledge system
A widely cited web page paper associated effort credited deliberate definition ontology technical term computer science
The paper defines ontology explicit specification conceptualization turn object concept entity presumed exist area interest relationship hold among
While term specification conceptualization caused much debate essential point definition ontology One objection definition overly broad allowing range specification simple glossary logical theory couched predicate calculus
But hold true data model complexity example relational database single table column still instance relational data model
Taking pragmatic view one say ontology tool product engineering thereby defined use
From perspective matter use ontology provide representational machinery instantiate domain model knowledge base make query service represent result calling service
For example API search service might offer textual glossary term formulate query would act
On hand Semantic Web standard suggests specific formalism encoding ontology OWL several variant vary expressive power
This reflects intent specification abstract data model domain conceptualization independent particular form
Ontology discussed applied context software database engineering yet theoretical grounding well
specifies vocabulary make assertion may input output knowledge agent software program
As ontology provides language communicating agent
An agent supporting interface required use term ontology knowledge
Nonetheless definition formal constraint ontology put restriction stated language
In essence committing ontology
supporting interface using ontology vocabulary requires statement asserted input output definition constraint ontology
This analogous requirement row database table insert statement SQL must consistent integrity constraint stated declaratively independently internal data format
Similarly ontology must formulated representation language intended semantic level specification independent data modeling strategy implementation
For instance conventional database model may represent identity individual using primary key assigns unique identifier individual
However primary key identifier artifact modeling process denote something domain
Ontologies typically formulated language closer expressive power logical formalism predicate calculus
This allows ontology designer able state semantic constraint without forcing particular encoding strategy
For example typical ontology formalism one would able say individual member class attribute value without referring implementation pattern use primary key identifier
Similarly ontology one might represent constraint hold across relation simple declaration A subclass B might encoded join foreign key relational model
concerned making representational choice capture relevant distinction domain highest level abstraction still clear possible meaning term
As form data modeling knowledge skill required
The heritage computational ontology philosophical ontology rich body theory make ontological distinction systematic coherent manner
For example many insight formal ontology motivated understanding real world applied building computational ontology world data
When ontology encoded standard formalism also possible reuse large previously designed ontology motivated systematic account human knowledge language
In context ontology embody result academic research offer operational method put theory practice database system
Ontologies part standard stack Semantic Web used specify standard conceptual vocabulary exchange data among system provide service answering query publish reusable knowledge base offer service facilitate interoperability across multiple heterogeneous system database
The key role ontology respect database system specify data modeling representation level abstraction specific database design logical physical data exported translated queried unified across independently developed system service
Successful application date include database interoperability cross database search integration web service

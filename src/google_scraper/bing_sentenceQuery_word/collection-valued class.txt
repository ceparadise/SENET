discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

In paper investigate way fixed collection valued constraint combined express valued constraint
We show case large class valued constraint possible arity expressed using valued constraint fixed finite arity
We also show simple class valued constraint including set monotonic valued constraint finite cost value expressed subset fixed finite arity hence form infinite hierarchy


A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data

But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

The chapter called Admissions Financial Aid describes transfer policy general term
Your transfer work evaluated required document received
All transfer student initially admitted University College
Please check transfer articulation agreement
If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution
If please discus UALR academic advisor answer question student transfer credit aspect student academic program study

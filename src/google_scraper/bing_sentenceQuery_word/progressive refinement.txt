generic term computer science encompasses various approach producing computer program simplifying existing program enable formal verification
In transformation
allows process done stage
Logically refinement normally involves additional complication
The progressive preparation product backlog requirement list approach also commonly described refinement
used convert abstract data model term example implementable
Operation refinement convert operation system implementable
The strengthened weakened process
This reduces specification typically completely implementation
For example value operation could refined implemented
Implementations would equally acceptable case using different route refinement
However must careful refine equivalent since unimplementable impossible select
The term also sometimes used coined
alternative technique formal refinement possible
The opposite refinement
inspired promotes program refinement
The implementation refinement
The also extends refinement calculus component language used industrial development
In type endowed predicate assumed hold element refined type
Refinement type express used used instance type function accepts natural number return natural number greater may written
Refinement type thus related

Could somebody explain difference dependent type refinement type
As I understand refinement type contains value type fulfilling predicate
Is feature dependent type distinguishes
If help I came across Refined type via Liquid Haskell project dependent type via Coq Agda
That said I looking explanation theory differ
The main difference along two dimension underlying theory used
Lets focus latter
As user logic specification LiquidHaskell refinement type system generally restricted decidable fragment verification inference completely automatic meaning one require proof term sort needed full dependent setting
This lead significant automation
For example compare insertion sort LH Idris However automation come price
One use arbitrary function specification one fully dependent world restricts class property one write
Thus one goal refinement system class specified fully dependent system proved
Perhaps happy meeting ground get best world
Refinement type simply usual type predicate
That given T usual type P predicate T v T P v refinement type
T case called
AFAIK Liquid Haskell also allow type x
Notice fully dependent type like allowed
Liquid Type system described indeed decidable Liquid Haskell use SMT solver
However Liquid Haskell also requires proof term value called typed language sit write Liquid Haskell program write function type
Dependent type type depend value way
A classic example type vector length value
Refinement type say question consist value given type satisfy given predicate

type positive number
These concept particularly related I know
Of course also reasonably dependent refinement type like type number greater

At work tasked inferring type information dynamic language
I rewrite sequence statement nested expression like Since starting general type information trying deduce specific type natural choice refinement type
For example conditional operator return union type true false branch
In simple case work well
I ran snag however trying infer type following Which rewritten HM would infer f Int Int consequently g Int Int Int
The actual type I want able infer g
Int already using functional dependency resolve type overloaded operator I figured natural choice use resolve type within
That type application together uniquely determine type
However turn fundeps lend terribly well variable number source type
Anyway interplay polymorphism refinement typing problematic
So better approach missing
currently digesting Types would appreciate literature pointer
You stumbled fact inference static invariant language quite difficult practice addition undecidable theory
I sure definitive answer question note several thing Polymorphism refinement type behave poorly together noted particular notion general type lost
A consequence analysis based refinement type presence polymorphism may need chose analysis opposed compositional analysis use heuristic decide type want assign program
There strong relationship inferring refinement type Computing abstract interpretation program Computing loop invariant imperative language
With mind disorganized reference inference refinement type
Note many differing flavor refinement type I tend interested refinement inductive datatypes list may skewed direction
Start classic Cousot Cousot
This explains extend abstract interpretation program using relational semantics
Rhondon Kawaguchi Jhala
This evolved work combine HM type predicate refinement infer security annotation array bound check instance ML style program
The inference proceeds step first HM inference type annotation guide choice refinement perform
I probably also mention work Fournet Swarmy Chen Strub extension seems similar liquid type approach goal verifying cryptographic protocol algorithm distributed computing
I sure much published work inference annotation case
There Chin Khoo inference specific kind refinement type type size annotation
The programming language system allows various refinement provides facility writing program
However annotation may arbitrarily complex thus undecidable therefore may require user interaction
I believe form inference type I sure article recommend however
Last least Ole Agesen
While mentioning refinement type explicitly seems work closest solving problem seem
Do fooled mention parametric polymorphism abstract look infer tuples possible atomic type
Emphasis given efficiency
I recommend reading article first see solves problem
Side note type inference presence intersection type undecidable simplest form intersection type exactly strongly normalizing term

Lots written backlog refinement US used call grooming lot good
There lot say practice
However I seen treatment whether differently initial backlog
Therefore I setting post next answer question Usually I spin new agile team initial backlog
Nevertheless parent organization always know want team The vision mission charter might communicated clearly
Sometimes documented requirement often called PRD MRD BRD
Whatever case backlog user story I typically hold story writing workshop get ball rolling
Now crude backlog need refined
This post idea come even convert already exists user story
The focus initial refinement meeting subsequent refinement session
For initial refinement I recommend compressed refinement
After I recommend continuous refinement
When refining initial backlog often spinning new agile team usually someone chain command wondering Why anyone coding yet There great deal pressure get started already
The team probably anxious get started unless still trying wrap prior project
At time want know expect get done new work get next release much backlog release date roll around
It sufficient client tell get get get

We also need refine backlog identify dependency risk item long lead time
Anyway take time create refine backlog form team stuff get rolling
We want good job refining backlog take forever get done
Therefore compressed approach backlog refinement
Stories written backlog crude story need refine quickly
In compressed refinement approach series refinement meeting
It could meeting better part week
The whole team attends
Please bring lunch preferably good lunch
You may find updating story agile management tool meeting
That generally unproductive strike right balance
Some edits might whole team collaboratively involved arguing wording meaning
Other edits done someone else room side
Of course edits made offline
This compressed approach tends detailed slow going crude story well refined story meeting
Since talked depth might well estimate go
Because story discussion detailed using approach might able get abbreviated sprint planning meeting first sprint
Organizations operate project mode rather product mode tend compressed refinement approach project come along
They spend little time getting backlog ready next project current project still underway
This backlog refinement done big batch
This rolling wave planning big tidal wave
That usually best approach
After compressed refinement let move continuous refinement
I talking even elaboration
Elaboration agile sense decomposing epic feature feature user story providing detail story acceptance criterion visual specification
Adding term Progressive Elaboration mean le time course time
Here may Progressive Elaboration Compressed Refinement We may still progressively elaborate epic feature intense period backlog refinement kick project yet still progressive elaboration user story acceptance criterion time
What I writing whether refine estimate story compressed period time say week maybe two whether refinement time advance
There downside
A compressed refinement allow long may necessary research figure thing learn new technology put necessary architectural place work contract party get group build dependent piece
Also sometimes need additional time thing soak
We need take step back look big picture
Because thing may end poorly refined backlog poor plan
For reason I recommend making switch project thinking punctuated refinement product thinking continuous refinement
That topic next post
I put Project Management title give Glen Alleman Create initial backlog stay top
Here There rule engagement need considered Product founding member

Science often distinguished domain human culture progressive nature contrast art religion philosophy morality politics exist clear standard normative criterion identifying improvement advance science
For example historian science George Sarton argued acquisition systematization positive knowledge human activity truly cumulative progressive progress definite unquestionable meaning field field science Sarton
However traditional cumulative view scientific knowledge effectively challenged many philosopher science thereby notion progress also questioned field science
Debates normative concept progress time concerned axiological question aim goal science
The task philosophical analysis consider alternative answer question What meant progress science
This conceptual question complemented methodological question How recognize progressive development science
Relative definition progress account best indicator one may study factual question To extent respect science progressive
The idea science collective enterprise researcher successive generation characteristic Modern Age Nisbet
Classical empiricist Francis Bacon rationalist René Descartes seventeenth century urged use proper method inquiry guarantee discovery justification new truth
This cumulative view scientific progress important ingredient optimism eighteenth century Enlightenment incorporated Auguste Comte program positivism accumulating empirically certified truth science also promotes progress society
Other influential trend nineteenth century Romantic vision organic growth culture Hegel dynamic account historical change theory evolution
They inspired epistemological view among Marxists pragmatist regarded human knowledge process
interest history science William Whewell Charles Peirce Ernst Mach Pierre Duhem gave interesting analysis aspect scientific change
In early twentieth century analytic philosopher science started apply modern logic study science
Their main focus structure scientific theory pattern inference Suppe
This synchronic investigation finished product scientific activity questioned philosopher wished pay serious attention diachronic study scientific change
Among contribution one mention
Hanson Karl Popper Thomas Kuhn Paul Feyerabend incommensurability thesis Feyerabend Imre Lakatos methodology scientific research programme Lakatos Musgrave Larry Laudan
Darwinist model evolutionary epistemology advocated Popper Stephen Toulmin
These work challenged received view development scientific knowledge rationality
Popper falsificationism Kuhn account scientific revolution Feyerabend thesis meaning variance shared view science grow simply accumulating new established truth upon old one
Except perhaps period Kuhnian normal science theory change cumulative continuous earlier result science rejected replaced reinterpreted new theory conceptual framework
Popper Kuhn differed however definition progress former appealed idea successive theory may approach towards truth latter characterized progress term capacity theory
Since great number philosophical work published topic change development progress science Harré Stegmüller Howson Rescher Radnitzky Andersson Niiniluoto Tuomela Dilworth Smith Hacking Schäfer Niiniluoto Laudan Rescher Pitt Radnitzky Bartley Callebaut Pinxten Balzer et al
Hull Gavroglu et al
Kitcher Pera
These study also led many important novelty added toolbox philosopher science

Another recognition besides individual statement theory also need consider temporally developing unit scientific activity achievement Kuhn normal science Lakatos research programme Laudan research tradition Wolfgang Stegmüller dynamic theory evolution Philip Kitcher consensus practice
A new tool employed many defense realist view scientific progress Niiniluoto Aronson Harré Way Kuipers notion truthlikeness verisimilitude Popper
New interest development science promoted close historian philosopher science
For example case study historical example replacement Newton classical mechanic quantum theory theory relativity inspired many philosophical treatment scientific revolution
Further interesting material philosophical discussion scientific progress provided quantitative approach study growth scientific publication de Solla Price Rescher science indicator Elkana

Sociologists science studied dynamic interaction scientific community social institution
One favorite topic emergence new scientific specialty Mulkay Niiniluoto
Sociologists also concerned pragmatic problem progress best way organizing research activity order promote scientific advance
In way model scientific change turn relevant issue science policy Böhme Schäfer
Science complex system involving community scientist engaged research using scientific method order produce new knowledge
Thus notion science may refer social institution researcher research process method inquiry scientific knowledge
The concept progress defined relative aspect science
Hence different type progress distinguished relative science increased funding scientific research rising status scientist academic institution society increased skill expertise scientist invention new method research refinement scientific instrument increase advancement scientific knowledge
These type progress conceptually distinguished advance human activity even though may turn scientific progress least factual connection progress increased effectiveness tool technique progress economic prosperity quality life justice society
All aspect scientific progress may involve different consideration single concept would cover
For purpose appropriate concentrate cognitive progress give account advance science term success
Progress axiological normative concept distinguished neutral descriptive term change development Niiniluoto
In general say step stage stage constitutes progress mean respect relative standard criterion
In science normative demand contribution research yield cognitive profit success respect assessed publication referee peer review publication colleague
Hence theory scientific progress merely descriptive account pattern development science fact followed
Rather give specification used constitutive criterion good The naturalist program science study suggests normative question philosophy science reduced historical sociological investigation actual practice science
In spirit Laudan defended project testing philosophical model scientific change history science model often couched normative language recast declarative statement science behave Laudan et al
Donovan et al

It may case scientific work least best science age also good science
But also evident scientist often different opinion criterion good science rival researcher school make different choice preference theory research program
Therefore argued naturalist progress actual development science definition progress give u normative standard appraising choice scientific community made could made making make future
The task finding defending standard genuinely philosophical one enlightened history sociology reduced empirical study science
For reason Mizrahi empirical observation scientist talk aim science term knowledge rather merely truth settle philosophical debate scientific progress cf
Bird Niiniluoto
For many activity important distinguish
Quality primarily concept concerning skill competence performance task
Progress concept concerning success product relative goal
All acceptable work science fulfill certain standard quality
But seems necessary connection quality progress science
Sometimes research project fail produce important new result le competent lucky work lead success
Nevertheless skillful use method science make progress highly probable
Hence best practical strategy promoting scientific progress support research
Following pioneering work Derek de Solla Price scientometrics quantitative proposed measure scientific activity Elkana

For example output measure like measure scholarly achievement problematic whether crude measure sufficient indicate quality cf
Chotkowski La Follette
The number article refereed journal indicator quality author clear indicator yet define progress mean since publication may contribute different amount advance scientific knowledge
Rousseau Law proposed Nicholas Rescher mark certain part total number publication important merely alleged statistical regularity
Another example science indicator indicator impact publication visibility author within scientific community
Martin Irvine suggest concept scientific progress linked notion actual influence research surrounding scientific activity given time
It doubt correct one advance scientific knowledge without influencing epistemic state scientific community
But impact publication show successfully moved scientific community direction
If science must acknowledge movement direction constitute progress
The failure science indicator function definition scientific progress due fact take account scientific publication
To determine whether work give contribution scientific progress specify say alternatively problem solves relate content knowledge situation scientific community time publication
For reason research assessment exercise may use science indicator tool ultimately rely judgment peer substantial knowledge field
Progress concept
But even consider science cognitive enterprise reason assume goal science
In contrast Isaac Levi classic argued cognitive aim scientific inquiry defined weighted combination several different even conflicting
As shall see Section alternative theory scientific progress understood specification epistemic utility
For example might include truth information Levi see also Popper explanatory predictive power Hempel
Kuhn list value science includes accuracy consistency scope simplicity fruitfulness
A goal may sense reached finite number step finite time
A goal reached even approached
Thus utopian goal rationally pursued since progress made attempt reach
Walking moon utopian task sense
However inaccessible goal utopian unreachable goal morally perfect function Kant sense guide behavior able make progress towards
The classical sceptic argument science repeated Laudan knowing truth utopian task
Kant answer argument regard truth regulative principle science
Charles Peirce founder American pragmatism argued access truth ideal limit scientific inquiry destined guaranteed indefinite community investigator
Almeder interpretation Peirce view scientific progress finite number scientific problem solved finite time
However seem reason think truth generally accessible strong sense
Therefore crucial question whether possible make rational appraisal made progress direction truth see Section
A goal routine mechanical test showing goal reached approached
If defining criterion progress recognizable strong sense distinguish true perception
In word claim form The step stage stage B progressive distinguished appraisal form The step stage stage progressive available evidence
The latter appraisal judgment recognizable former claim may correct without knowing
Characteristics measure help u make appraisal
Laudan requires rational goal science accessible effectively recognizable Laudan
This requirement us rule truth goal science strong
The demand rationality dictate goal given reasonable indicator progress towards
A goal may may refer starting point destination point activity
If aim travel far home possible success measured distance Helsinki
If I wish become ever better better piano player improvement assessed relative earlier stage ideal Perfect Pianist
But I want travel San Francisco progress function distance destination
Only special case one way criterion distance distance B determine
Kuhn Stegmüller advocating criterion progress
In arguing view proper measure scientific achievement extent brings u closer ultimate goal one full objective true account nature Kuhn suggested learn substitute Kuhn
In spirit Stegmüller argued reject variant teleological metaphysics defining progress term coming closer closer A compromise criterion proposed following way
If science viewed activity natural define real progress term cognitive aim science know something still unknown real progress depends distance destination
But goal unknown u estimate perception progress based evidential consideration
This kind view aim science presuppose existence unique ultimate goal
To use Levi word goal may myopic rather messianic Levi particular target wish hit course inquiry redefined locally relative cognitive problem situation
Furthermore addition multiplicity possible target may several road lead destination
The character goal inquiry exclude Stegmüller call progress This analogous simple fact may approach San Francisco New York along two different Chicago St Louis
Some philosopher use concept progress rationality synonym progressive step science precisely based upon scientist rational choice
One possible objection scientific discovery progressive introduce novel idea even though fully explained rational term Popper cf
Hanson Kleiner
However another problem relevant By whose light step evaluated
This question urgent especially acknowledge standard good science changed history Laudan
As shall see main rival philosophical theory progress propose criterion capacity increasing truthlikeness applicable development science throughout history
On hand rationality methodological concept historically assessing rationality choice made past scientist study aim standard method alternative theory available evidence accepted within scientific community time cf
Doppelt Laudan Niiniluoto
If scientific community given point time accepted standard preference theory evidence case epistemic utility relative higher
But new situation standard different different preference might rational
A major controversy among philosopher science instrumentalist realist view scientific theory Leplin Psillos Niiniluoto
The follow Duhem thinking theory merely conceptual tool classifying systematizing predicting observational statement genuine content science found level theory Duhem
contrast regard theory attempt describe reality even beyond realm observable thing regularity theory regarded statement truth value
Excluding naive realist scientist fallibilists Peirce sense scientific theory hypothetical always corrigible principle
They may happen true know certain particular case
But even theory false cognitively valuable closer truth rival Popper
Theories testable observational evidence success empirical test give inductive confirmation Hintikka Kuipers corroboration theory Popper
It might seem natural expect main rival account scientific progress would based upon position instrumentalism realism
But partly true
To sure naive realist rule hold view progress many philosopher combine realist view theory axiological thesis truth important goal scientific inquiry
A version realist view progress formulated using notion truthlikeness
But also philosopher accept possibility realist treatment theory still deny truth relevant value science could function characterization scientific progress
Bas van Fraassen constructive empiricism take desideratum science theory say observable true
The acceptance theory involves claim empirically adequate truth theoretical level
Van Fraassen developed account scientific progress term constructive empiricism presumably account would close empiricist notion reduction Laudan account ability see Section
An instrumentalist denies theory truth value usually defines scientific progress referring virtue theory may increasing empirical success
In Duhem expressed idea simile scientific progress like mounting tide wave rise withdraw motion slow constant progress
However gave realist twist view assuming theory classify experimental law progress mean proposed classification approach natural classification Duhem
Evolutionary epistemology open instrumentalist Toulmin realist Popper interpretation
A biological approach human knowledge naturally give emphasis pragmatist view theory function instrument survival
Darwinist evolution biology fixed goal rather specie adapt ever changing environment
In applying account problem fitness theory taken mean theory member scientific community
But realist reinterpret evolutionary model taking fitness mean truthlikeness theory
For constructive empiricist would natural think among empirically adequate theory one theory better another theory entail true observational statement
Such comparison make sense least observation statement entailed proper subset entailed
Kemeny Oppenheim gave similar condition definition reduction reducible least well systematized observationally stronger observational statement explained also consequence
Variants empirical reduction relation given structuralist school term structure Stegmüller Scheibe Balzer et al
Moulines
A similar idea applied case first theory falsified observational evidence used Lakatos definition empirically progressive research programme new superseding theory corroborated excess content relative contain unrefuted content Lakatos Musgrave
The definition Kuipers allows even new theory empirically refuted sense inclusion empirical success fewer empirical
Against cumulative definition argued definition empirical progress take account important complication
A new theory often empirical consequence previous one entail observational statement sense close corresponding consequence
Various model introduced handle situation
An important special case limiting relation theory approach theory observational consequence approach parameter law approach limit value theory relativity approach classical mechanic velocity light c grows without limit
Here said concretization idealized theory Nowak Nowakowa Nowak
However model automatically guarantee step old theory new one progressive
For example classical mechanic related correspondence condition infinite number alternative mutually incompatible theory additional criterion needed pick best among
Kuhn strategy avoid notion truth understand science activity making accurate prediction solving problem puzzle
normal science cumulative term problem solved even revolution progressive sense relatively large part capacity old theory preserved new paradigm
But Kuhn argued may happen problem solved old theory longer relevant meaningful new theory
These case called A systematic account idea given Laudan theory defined number importance solved empirical problem minus number importance anomaly conceptual problem theory generates
Here concept anomaly refers problem theory fails solve solved rival
For Laudan solution problem theory mean statement problem deduced
A good theory thus empirically adequate strong empirical content conceptual problem
One difficulty account find proper framework identifying counting problem Rescher Kleiner
When Newton mechanic applied determine orbit planet Mars counted one problem
But given initial position Mars theory entail solution infinite number question concerning position Mars time
Perhaps important philosophical issue whether one may consistently hold notion may entirely divorced truth falsity realist may admit science activity mean attempt find solution predictive explanatory question Niiniluoto
A different view involved theory discus problem
A radical pragmatist view treat science systematic method solving decision problem relative various kind practical utility
According view called behavioralism statistician LJ
Savage science produce knowledge rather recommendation action accept hypothesis always decision act hypothesis true
Progress science measured achievement practical utility decision maker
An alternative methodological version pragmatism defended Rescher accepts realist view theory qualification argues progress science understood increasing success application Similarly Douglas suggesting distinction pure applied science relinquished defines progress term increased capacity predict control manipulate intervene various In view notion scientific progress effect reduced technological progress
Already ancient philosopher regarded explanation important function science
The status explanatory theory interpreted either instrumentalist realist way Plato school started tradition saving appearance astronomy Aristotle took theory necessary truth
Both party take criterion good theory shown van Fraassen constructive empiricism Wilfrid Sellars scientific realism Pitt Tuomela
When added good theory also yield true empirical prediction notion explanatory predictive power combined within notion Hempel
If demand systematic power simply mean theory many true deductive consequence observational language concept essentially equivalent notion empirical success empirical ability discussed Section normally explanation taken include additional condition besides mere deduction
Inductive systematization also taken account Hempel Niiniluoto Tuomela
One important idea regarding systematization good theory empirical data law different domain Kitcher
For Whewell paradigm case consilience successful unification Kepler law Galileo law mean Newton theory
If theory underdetermined observational data one often advised choose simplest theory compatible evidence Foster Martin
may aesthetic criterion theory choice may also cognitive function helping u attempt understand world economical way
Ernst Mach notion economy thought related demand important especially engineering science applied science example mathematical equation made simpler suitable approximation solved computer
Simplicity also related notion systematic unifying power
This clear Eino Kaila concept defined ratio explanatory power structural complexity theory translation see Kaila
According conception progress achieved finding structurally simpler explanation data increasing scope explanation without making complex
Laudan formula solved empirical problem minus generated conceptual problem variation idea
Realist theory scientific progress take truth important goal inquiry
This view built classical definition knowledge justified true belief science activity also activity
However truth relevant epistemic utility inquiry
This shown clear way cognitive decision theory Levi Niiniluoto
Let u denote B n set mutually exclusive jointly exhaustive hypothesis
Here hypothesis may informative description alternative state affair possible world within conceptual framework
For example may complete theory expressible finite language
If interpreted domain sentence truth value true false follows one one true hypothesis say
Our identify target
The element potential problem
The set D B consists disjunction complete answer
The partial answer D B corresponding I know represented tautology disjunction complete answer
For D B let u g j epistemic utility accepting j true
We also assume rational probability measure associated language j assigned epistemic probability P j e given evidence
Then best hypothesis D B one maximizes For comparative purpose may say one hypothesis better another higher expected utility formula
If truth relevant epistemic utility true answer equally good false answer equally bad
Then may take u g j simply truth value relative j Hence u g real truth value tv g relative domain
It follows expected utility U e equal posterior probability P e
In sense may say posterior probability equal expected truth value
The rule maximizing expected utility lead extremely conservative policy best hypothesis satisfy P e completely certain
tautology
On account certain truth always progressive change uncertain answer logically weaker one
The argument using high probability criterion theory choice made already Popper see Popper
He proposed good theory bold improbable
This idea made precise theory semantic information
Levi measure information content I g partial answer D B number complete answer excludes
With suitable normalization I g one complete answer j I g tautology
If choose u g j I g U e I g complete answer B maximal expected utility
This measure favor strong hypothesis unable discriminate strongest one
For example step false complete answer true one count progress
Therefore information relevant epistemic utility
Another measure information content cont g P g Hintikka
If choose u g j cont g expected utility U e P g maximized contradiction probability contradictory sentence zero
Any false theory improved adding new falsity
Again see information content alone give good definition scientific progress
The remark made explanatory systematic power
Levi proposal epistemic utility weighted combination truth value tv g information content I g index boldness indicating much scientist willing risk error gamble truth attempt relieved agnosticism
The expected epistemic utility A comparative notion progress better could defined requiring I I P e P e hypothesis would incomparable requirement
By using weight formula express balance two mutually conflicting goal inquiry
It virtue partial answer D B comparable better value larger
If epistemic utility defined information content cont g way accepting hypothesis gain content true lose content true hypothesis false expected utility U e equal This measure combine criterion boldness small prior probability P g high posterior probability P e
Similar result obtained cont g replaced Hempel measure systematic power syst g e P e
For Levi best hypothesis D B complete true answer
But utility assignment also make assumption may seem problematic false hypothesis even make small error worse truth even uninformative tautology false complete answer utility see however modified definition Levi among false hypothesis utility covaries logical strength
false entail greater utility h
These feature motivated Levi project using epistemic utility basis acceptance rule
But utility used ordering rival theory theory truthlikeness suggests kind principle
Popper notion truthlikeness also combination truth information Popper
For verisimilitude represents idea approaching comprehensive Popper explication used cumulative idea truthlike theory sense inclusion true consequence le false consequence turned comparison applicable pair false theory
An alternative method defining verisimilitude initiated Pavel Tichy Risto Hilpinen relies essentially concept similarity
In similarity approach developed Niiniluoto closeness truth explicated locally mean distance partial answer D B target cognitive problem
For purpose need function express distance j ij two arbitrary element
By normalization may choose ij
The choice depends cognitive problem make use metric structure subspace real number syntactic similarity statement
Then partial answer let g minimum distance disjuncts g normalized sum distance disjuncts
Then g tell close hypothesis degree relative target g
On hand g includes penalty mistake allows relative
The measure b combine two aspect
Then degree Thus parameter indicates cognitive interest hitting close truth parameter indicates interest excluding falsity distant truth
In many application choosing equal give intuitively reasonable result
If distance function trivial ij otherwise Tr g reduces variant Levi definition epistemic utility
Obviously Tr g take maximum value equivalent
If tautology disjunction element Tr g
If Tr g misleading strong sense cognitive value smaller complete ignorance
When unknown degree truthlikeness calculated
But degree verisimilitude partial answer given evidence given If evidence entail j make j completely certain P j e ver e reduces Tr g j
If complete answer equally probable ver e also constant
The truthlikeness function allows u define absolute concept expected truthlikeness function ver give relative concept Cf
Niiniluoto
According definition RP meaningful say one theory satisfies better cognitive goal answering problem another theory
This absolute standard scientific progress sense Section
Definition EP show claim progress fallibly evaluated basis evidence ver e ver e rational claim evidence step fact progressive
This claim may course mistaken since estimation progress relative two factor available evidence probability measure employed definition
Both evidence epistemic probability P e may mislead u
In sense problem estimating verisimilitude difficult problem induction
The measure expected truthlikeness used retrospective comparison past theory evidence taken include currently accepted theory truthlikeness estimated ver e T Niiniluoto
In spirit Barrett proposed science make progress toward truth elimination descriptive probable approximate truth Newtonian gravitation warranted nesting relation general theory relativity
Bird defended epistemic definition progress accumulation knowledge semantic conception accumulation true belief succession theory increasing verisimilitude
According Bird accidentally true truthlike belief without justification constitute progress
This kind thought experiment may seem artificial since always sort justification hypothetical theory accepted least seriously considered scientific community
But Bird argument raise important question whether justification merely instrumental progress Rowbottom necessary progress Bird
Another interesting question whether rejection unfounded accidentally true belief regressive
The truthlikeness approach reply problem distinguishing real progress RP estimated progress EP justification constitutive progress sense RP claim real progress justified appealing expected verisimilitude Cevolani Tambolo
On hand notion progress explicated EP combination RP EP relative evidence justification time
Most account truthlikeness satisfy principle among true theory truthlikeness covaries logical strength exception see Oddie
So accumulation knowledge special case increasing verisimilitude cover case progress successive false theory
In attempt rehabilitate cumulative knowledge model scientific progress Bird admits historical sequence theory none fully true

As knowledge entail truth Bird try save epistemic account reformulating past false theory true one
He proposes approximately true proposition approximately true improving precision approximation object knowledge
One problem treatment scientist typically formulate theory exact statement time proposal known large margin error would needed transform true theory
Further many past theory approximately true truthlike
Ptolemy geocentric theory rejected Copernican revolution retained form approximately Ptolemy
Indeed progressive step Ptolemy Copernicus Newton Einstein matter improved precision involve change theoretical postulate law
A problem Bird proposal question whether approximation proposition able distinguish progress regress science Niiniluoto
The definition progress RP contrasted model belief revision Gärdenfors
The simplest case revision expansion theory conjoined input statement new theory T
According measure true expansion T least truthlike
But false true T may le truthlike
For example let false theory state number planet let true sentence number
Then T state number planet clearly le truthlike
Similar example show AGM revision false theory true input need increase truthlikeness Niiniluoto
In Section made distinction real estimated progress term truthlikeness measure
A similar distinction made connection measure empirical success
For example one may distinguish two notion ability theory number problem number problem
Real progress could defined latter former give u estimate progress
The scientific realist may continue line thought arguing measure empirical success fact best indicator real cognitive progress measured term truth truthlikeness
For example explains shown also increase probability
A similar reasoning employed give ultimate argument scientific realism theoretical realism assumption make empirical success science miracle Putnam Psillos cf
criticism Laudan
This mean best explanation empirical progress science hypothesis science also progressive level theory
The thesis science progressive overall claim scientific activity
It imply particular step science fact progressive individual scientist make mistake even scientific community fallible collective judgment
For reason propose definition thesis progressive nature science becomes tautology analytic truth
This undesirable consequence follows truth limit scientific inquiry sometimes called consensus theory truth mere tautology limit scientific research truth Laudan
But trivialization thesis attributed Peirce realized truth limit inquiry coincide best probability one Niiniluoto
The notion truthlikeness allows u make sense claim science converges towards truth
But characterization progress increasing truthlikeness given Section presuppose teleological metaphysics Stegmüller convergent realism Laudan scientific eschatology Moulines rely assumption future behavior science
The claim scientific progress still questioned thesis observation ontology relative theory
If true comparison rival theory appears impossible cognitive rational ground
Kuhn compared Gestalt switch Dilworth
Feyerabend concluded methodological anarchism development science art resemble
Hanson Popper Kuhn Feyerabend agreed observational language
Accounts reduction progress take granted preservation observational statement within thus run trouble
Even though Laudan account progress allows argued comparison capacity two rival theory presupposes kind correlation translation statement theory Pearce
Various reply proposed issue
One movement language structure Stegmüller Moulines turn reduction level structure already guarantee commensurability since induces translation conceptual framework Pearce
Another point evidence statement may happen neutral respect rival theory even though laden theory
The realist may also point observation concern estimation progress EP definition real progress RP increasing truthlikeness mention notion observation
Even though Popper accepted observation rejected general thesis myth framework Lakatos Musgrave
Popper insisted growth knowledge always revolutionary sense new theory contradicts old one correcting still continuity new theory explain old theory successful extent
Feyerabend tried claim successive theory inconsistent incommensurable combination make little sense
Kuhn argued possibility finding complete translation language rival theory later work admitted possibility scientist may learn different theoretical language
Kuhn kept insisting way reconstruct phrase like really theory ontology
Convergence truth seems impossible ontology change theory
The idea formulated Putnam Laudan pessimistic many past theory science turned reason expect even future theory fail thus also fail approximately true truthlike
The difficulty realism seem reinforced observation measure truthlikeness relative language
The choice conceptual framework decided mean notion truthlikeness need additional criterion
In defense truthlikeness approach one may point fact comparison two theory relevant case considered perhaps via suitable translation rival answer cognitive problem
It interesting compare Newton Einstein theory truthlikeness Newton Darwin theory
Another line appeal theory reference order show rival theory regarded speaking entity Psillos
For example Thompson Bohr later physicist talking electron even though theory electron differ
This possible standard descriptive theory reference theory refer entity give true description
Kuhn Feyerabend meaning holism devastating consequence realism presupposes account reference
A similar argument used Moulines denies progress could understood knowing structuralist reconstruction progress partial incommensurability assumes rival theory share intended application
Causal theory reference allow reference preserved even within change theory Kitcher
The result obtained descriptive account modified introducing Principle Charity Putnam Smith Niiniluoto theory refers entity give truthlike description
An alternative account illustrated relation phlogiston theory oxygen theory given Schurz notion structural correspondence
This make possible even false theory referring
Moreover reference invariance two successive theory even though false progress mean latter theory give truthlike description common domain old theory

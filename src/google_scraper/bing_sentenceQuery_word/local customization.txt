The specific depend context term generally implies action location machine function program point reference
In particular Running machine currently
A database would served machine client software accessing
Serving website would mean webserver machine browser trying access
Own computer would probably best translation
So server remote device
It also mean setup local server something
For example run simple html file locally running browser production would probably served webserver instead
From Local Developer It depends
It mean Can run without going network
Where mean physically logically
So I opened physical laptop log locally mean I log machine locked
If I already session machine another system log locally mean without needing authorize network

Open Universiteit Netherlands Netherlands Open Universiteit Netherlands Netherlands Open Universiteit Netherlands One claim OER movement make availability open digital learning material improves quality education
The promise ability offer educational program take account specific demand learner
The question reach situation customized demand met using OER acceptable quality acceptable cost
This situation resembles mass customization common industry several decade
Techniques industry end product assembled demand customer starting point translated field education course learning path curriculum assembled using mixture open closed learning material learning service offered institution
Advanced IT support modeling learning material service configurator used learner necessary condition approach
Mass customization personalized learning OER The launch MIT OpenCourseware project marked beginning worldwide publishing open educational resource OER
This development aim achieving high availability learning material possibility adapt fit context use
One claim OER movement make availability open digital learning material improves quality education Commonwealth Learning
The promise ability offer educational program take account specific demand learner
This promise heard even louder since rise MOOC Horn Christensen
This trend highlight unbundling education learning certifying learning offered one single university
A consequence trend availability learning pathway necessarily leading degree
A learner able shop fulfill demand thereby challenging university satisfy demand
Personal circumstance job demand financial situation create demand alternative learning path
Bates noted student diversity within technological era considered also Learners homogenous mass vary considerably term educational background income age learning experience
This diversity student body growing fast
It become increasingly important educational organization able deliver teaching variety technological format depending need individual teaching context target group reached
One expect demand individualized learning path grow coming year increasing need people higher education current financial crisis
The former mean people youngster needed fulfill demand
The latter cause budget cut university student loan forcing student take job addition study activity
OER considered generic building block create learning material fit learner homogeneous group learner
A common name building block learning object Neven Duval
Nowadays creating learning material requires lot craftsmanship effort result different level quality high associated cost
Publishing reusing OER pose several challenge Schuwer Yuen Wong Adapting OER localizing context used important activity reuse Matkin
Unfortunately difficult expensive process OECD
So question reach situation customized demand met using OER acceptable quality acceptable cost taken account challenge listed
In paper address applicability added value assemble order ATO answer question
ATO approach developed industry combine advantage customization provides customer specific usually expensive product mass production produce standard product acceptable quality low price
ATO function developing limited number component combining large array different product assembled
Such approach provide variety quality acceptable price
ATO approach realize mass customization
In Tseng Jiao mass customization defined The technology system deliver good service meet individual customer need near mass production efficiency
For education equivalent personalized learning
In Wikipedia personalized learning defined tailoring pedagogy curriculum learning environment meet need aspiration individual According Department Education personalization considered encompassing individualization differentiation Individualization refers instruction paced learning need different learner
Learning goal student student progress material different speed according learning need
For example student might take longer progress given topic skip topic cover information already know repeat topic need help
Differentiation refers instruction tailored learning preference different learner
Learning goal student method approach instruction varies according preference student research found work best student like
Personalization refers instruction paced learning need tailored learning preference tailored specific interest different learner
In environment fully personalized learning objective content well method pace may vary personalization encompasses differentiation individualization
To describe open education use five component open education model model Mulder Janssen
In model three component comprise education supply side learning material learning service teaching effort
Two component demand side demand learner demand environment society
The process mass customization educational term based demand group learner combination learning material learning service teaching effort fulfill certain explicit implicit requirement supply building block learning material service teaching effort combined offer fulfilling demand
The resulting offer comply several general requirement complying demand curriculum level potentially significant number building block available
To end institution meet part demand learner
Elements like determining learning goal adaptation learning process based feedback learner assessing level prior knowledge part approach
We consider mass customization approach fitting continuum approach tailor education demand individual learner depicted Figure
In Figure distinguish two level tailoring course curriculum vertical axis
Some example approach realize certain amount tailoring added framework
In paper elaborate
We start attempt educational field dating back last century
Then introduce terminology use solution industry developed structuring product end user
We apply insight field education
We conclude view future work field
The dawn demand driven approach education described Kirschner Valcke
They describe need demand driven approach started beginning century
They foresee development demand driven approach using IT going three stage In current society prosperity depends knowledge economy growing demand youngster lifelong learning working staff even urgent
On hand cost education pressure growing demand current economic crisis
The cry efficient effective learning process heard Universities UK
To fulfill need education become geared demand individual learner effective possible
However tailoring educational supply single demand far efficient
A balance two conflicting demand found approach learning tailored demand individual learner using IT mean realize
One early attempt realize situation came Mercator system Valcke et Martens et
This system based approach course material generated based student characteristic
These characteristic could example determined mean pretests
The database material system contained domain specific content didactical component
The granularity content varied chapter theme subthemes
Students select topic table content
This table content tailor made dependent student characteristic
Learning material selected topic appropriate didactical element determined system
The approach Mercator system turned complex handle
Offering several different pedagogical model starting point resulted offering several differing content learning activity
This needed granularity material database detailed workable
Different version learning material sometimes needed adjustment level paragraph
This led combinatorial explosion version basically learning material could hardly managed
Another drawback level detail instance learning material described order make available usable specific learning demand
Experiences Mercator led development EML Educational Modeling Language Koper Manderveld
EML semantic notation unit learning used
It enables specification learning technology taking account pedagogical framework different type learning object expressing relationship typed learning object defining structure content behavior different learning object
The current standard IMS Learning Design based first specification EML
Several approach use hierarchical task network HTN planner generate course material adapted competency learner
Ulrich Melis implement HTN planner expert system
This approach also need large amount learning material available able generate adapted course
In Morales et used basis generate conditional learning pathway able adapt run time event
This approach requires large amount learning material described vocabulary
also form basis approach sketched Hernández et al

Here model user built able take account intrinsic characteristic user learning style desired achieved competency learning process
Karampiperis Sampson describe approach personalization learning material limited adaptive hypermedia system
Another perspective mass customization education given Asseldonk Mulder
They describe following characteristic mass customization
The growing availability OER mean open education MOOCs provides new opportunity creating tailor made learning pathway eventually leading credit degree
Horn Christensen foresee future learning becomes continuous process
The need customization drive toward made available open offering
We believe situation closed system still value curator role determining quality available learning material structuring space learning material defining curriculum smaller learning pathway
In Shoham similar vision future education described envisioning content unit smaller current course remixing content new content customized learner
Neither Horn Shoham describes realize situation
Approaches mass customization engineering education sketched Rippel et al
Mistree et al

These description take account reuse OER limited specific situation provide choice learner create learning path
All approach sketched provide mean realize desirable situation customized demand met using mixture OER closed material acceptable quality acceptable cost
This justifies search approach inspired successful attempt another field
In next section describe mechanism industry developed overcome problem mass customization product described
These mechanism basis IT support customer match personal demand individualized version product
Industry made move mass customization several decade ago
The rise computing power growing ability offered Internet provided mean implement concept research subject
Products designed product family
Ulrich Tung define product family large set end product constructed much smaller set These kind product highly modularized use standardized interface fit module together customer specific end product
Production end product characterized The end product built customer specification stock existing component
Assembling end product take account already existing module interface use
This move enabled producer combine advantage mass production high quality relatively cheap product customer specificity
This customer specificity seen bounded within option set envisaged engineering product family
One advanced example car industry
Potential buyer car use user friendly configurators lead process assembling car selecting component feature closely adhere demand
These configurators indispensable combinatorial explosion different end product arise different version component feature combined
Examples configurators Volkswagen Passat Volvo
The cornerstone configurators model product mass customization needed
We start introducing terminology describe model
Some thing real world worthwhile describe
Such thing called
A description object serf goal mostly used mean communicating object
A group similar object called
The property object type part description called
The difference parameter several value case determined customer
When attribute parameter get value get object type
Which parameter description object type contains determined purpose description
attribute different value describe essentially different instance object type purpose described
A originates range value essential parameter constrained
From specialty created parameter get value
Constraining range value parameter called
Suppose want describe car use configurator
Based experience manufacturer important parameter purpose whether car diesel petrol engine
Table list different term introduced situation
In case creating variant selecting value parameter subject constraint
Two special type constraint distinguished For car example inclusion could When upholstery cloth upholstery color black
An example exclusion could When type chair sport upholstery alcantara
A variant meet constraint called
In practice number parameter select determine much higher
Even complex reality taking account special offer bundled package offering discount selected whole numerous constraint affecting option parameter
Even simplified example car configuration taking account constraint total number valid configuration
Managing information becomes even difficult new type car introduced leading extra value parameter even new parameter
For example parameter keyless entry exist recently
A big advantage modeling approach easy maintenance new feature become available
To add new feature model new parameter new value existing parameter added together possible constraint
An important prerequisite enables product customized modular structure physical product interface
Especially reason efficiency module usable different specialty even different type product call high degree standardization interface keep manageable
An example screw used connect two module
DIN Deutsches Institut für Normung maintains extensive list standard screw DIN
A big advantage standard possibility outsource production screw third party referring standard suffices
However standard limited power
Simple thing screw standardized
But component become slightly complex standardization becomes rapidly difficult
For example positioning screw hole allow two component bolted together standardized
The car manufacturer usually determine
Only exception standardization higher level known
One placement size car radio
Even something easy envisage standard placement attachment position wheel car model specific
The main interface component therefore brand specific
The configurator contains knowledge parameter value constraint guide customer process end valid configuration car
Customization however limited parameter shown
So demand car electrical engine customized example earlier shown
The customer option either accept go another manufacturer give opportunity
The parameter object type described determine module made visible customer
The element used constructing module remain invisible customer
A balance available number parameter made visible customer complexity managing amount information including constraint parameter
Choosing right parameter market driven
For car type engine color important parameter customer determine
Rigidity bodywork however customer important property car offered customer
Summarizing important lesson industry mass customization In section elaborate applying theory practice mass customization industry education
The objective identical achieved industry combine high quality relatively low cost customization within limit
Our starting point product model educational field depicted Figure
A description model For computer science exist many
Each curriculum built course structured programming course built
unit control structure programming language
Courses organized A learning pathway way individual student group student chooses go part curriculum
In model variation possible several entity In vision learning unit building block variant built upon
A course instantiation variant learning unit learning pathway instantiation variant course specific sequence
Customization offered student A curriculum determines certain constraint possible variation
For example ACM knowledge area mentioned computer science curriculum
Also learning objective named knowledge skill bachelor master computer science subject minimum number hour spent curriculum
A valid configuration course comply description curriculum
The starting point student configuration preferred learning pathway
To illustrate parameterization learning unit course learning pathway could look educational environment use following fictitious example
Consider course curriculum Computer Science depicted Table
Each course consists several learning unit
Experiences curriculum show important parameter course mode delivery
To illustrate parameterization course Table provides one course Introduction CS
This course made four learning unit
For third fourth unit student select respectively different option
Each learning unit delivered several format
There several mode delivery course student also select several option final assessment tutoring course
Note latter element example learning service teaching effort
There several constraint parameter
There constraint mode delivery relation start date course start date form final assessment combination option learning unit
Table depicts parameterization learning pathway
It assumed two course allowed taken simultaneously
Furthermore learning path start Introduction CS end internship
The important parameter learning pathway optional course selected
Although example describes simple situation number possible configuration taking account constraint already large
Assuming parameterization course one described course Introduction CS total number learning pathway specialty course period average course specialty learning unit format option learning unit option learning unit final assessment tutoring mode
The number valid configuration smaller still significant
In reality number parameter much larger course learning pathway
Furthermore number course make curriculum much larger number example
Besides following requirement count curriculum whole These requirement curriculum whole translated parameter constraint product model
IMS Learning Design IMS LD provides u description element together build course Koper Manderveld
This specification date back
The basic unit within IMS LD unit learning
This unit described attribute depicted Figure Koper Manderveld
The attribute given model used parameter create variant learning unit
In example used role attribute parameter variant tutoring
The attribute also used provide student information learning unit selection informed
But variant also arise due flexibility service offered institution option blended online variant course example
An important difference modeling product industry education lack standardized interface module latter situation
This complicates configuring curriculum whether open available source elsewhere combined coherent whole
In situation standardization initiated standardizing learning objective course course section
The description learning material expanded enumerating learning objective material contribute
An attempt standardization Achievement Standards Network ASN
A reasonable alternative standardize level institution
Learning material outside institution added structure careful process selection limited adjustment
The lack standard interface specific demand curriculum quality OER lead u conclusion ATO approach currently viable education institution orchestrates process
Another difference industry end product almost completely determined physical component
In educational field mixture physical component learning material learning service teaching effort
As industry IT support indispensable modeling product assembling valid configuration
The product data modeled bill material constraint also defined
An important requirement bill material manage potential explosion combination module
A generic bill material Hegge Wortmann type bill material developed specifically kind product
Also configurator built upon product model tool used learner assemble learning pathway demand
The challenge institution offering possibility organize supply way group le homogeneous type learner accommodated individual user get feeling unique situation taken starting point
To validate idea described determine perceived added value eight expert interviewed
Their expertise educational technology OER
Some expert responsible offering curriculum
In interview idea explained expert
Then asked judge added value approach ranging explain opinion
This led following finding Seven eight expert judged added value higher scored scored scored
Arguments provided Concerns approach also mentioned
A single expert responsible curriculum judged added value necessary precondition make organization adapt situation
This concern mentioned expert
To realize setting approach possible learning goal content described carefully level standardization building course curriculum present
Furthermore comparing activity teacher car manufacturer possibly lead resistance acceptance idea
Another consideration mentioned several expert many case mixture approach individual tailoring necessary
Parameterization model demand
The remaining created higher cost
Two expert questioned business case behind approach
When institution embrace form mass customization cost per student probably rise
What driver force institution start approach
Several expert also made remark extension use approach limited regular curriculum possible role could play This lead u conclusion idea sketched worthwhile pursue
In next section sketch possible action
When look requirement challenge mentioned introduction noticed approach mass customization based ATO successfully transferred field education would deal number issue mentioned
By selecting learning unit granularity modeling product available OER readily reused offering
What needed though increase findability detailed description along OER learning goal pedagogy required foreknowledge
As also mentioned Introduction demand offering personalized learning expected grow next decade Horn Christensen
In situation need supply learning material closed open supply well possible necessarily
fit individual demand learner
When expectation come true university succeeds offering best fit potentially largest target group gain competitive advantage
Creating best fit take account learning technology aspect variance pedagogical approach organizational variation offering online course paced paced
Opportunities realize offering enhanced using technique like learning analytics development like semantic web
These technique used add context related property learning material thereby realizing better findability OER providing end result better suited individual user relatively low cost

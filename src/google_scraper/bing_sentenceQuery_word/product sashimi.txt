A computer science specifying symbol substitution recursively performed generate new symbol sequence
A finite set production main component specification specifically
The component finite set finite set known alphabet distinguished symbol start symbol
In production form arbitrary string terminal nonterminals however may empty string
If empty string denoted symbol rather leave side blank
So production form operator denotes
The type formal grammar impose additional restriction constitutes production
Notably side production must single nonterminal symbol
So production form To generate string language one begin string consisting single successively applies rule number time order rewrite string
This stop obtain string containing terminal
The language consists string generated manner
Any particular sequence legal choice taken rewriting process yield one particular string language
If multiple different way generating single string grammar said
For example assume alphabet consists start symbol following rule start choose rule apply
If choose rule replace obtain string
If choose rule replace obtain string
This process repeated symbol alphabet
If choose rule replace obtain string done
We write series choice briefly using symbol
The language grammar set string generated using process

know supposed developing software incrementally using agile process like Scrum
We know building software little bit time coding testing reviewing go right
What actually mean
What increment look like
How big
How small
How find
And These good question
In blog I discus one part puzzle around long time
I first heard context RUP Rational Unified Process agile process focused development Use Cases
It introduced way understand XP eXtreme Programming
And early Ken Schwaber preferred way develop software within Scrum Team
And current Software Craftsmanship movement part developing Clean Like I said Sashimi method around long time
It pretty much standard way thing everybody know
Pity
So I going talk
Let say Client hankering salmon say u I want decide build one
The Method pretty simple
Here might happen And salmon deliver Client
Now let agile way
We sure Client want salmon know best could explain wanted
We agile know start building something little bit time try figure
Sashimi fish method called Sashimi Method build fish one thin slice time So going Sashimi Method
Note started thinking developing Salmon maybe Client u finish building Trout
We could wind delivering fish half Salmon half Trout good yummy
And Sashimi Method
This method simple also simplistic
In Sashimi Method Stories Functional Stories build little Architecture little Infrastructure functionality interface
Real development like But except exception
Thanks
Glad enjoyed Required field marked

Share post fan club
So I defrosting ahi steak going get seared dinner noticed package say sashimi grade
But far I figure USDA grading system place fish
I suppose I batch tuna wildly varying quality I might label cat food grade sashimi grade let people know good stuff
But designation actually mean anything marketing hype

Consulting Coaching Training Speaking Maybe idea product
You figure deliver software delight customer
You want ship something value
Maybe need manage project already going go budget
Your deadline looming horizon
You tried negotiating scope way book taught working
We
Tomorrow
Hurry Maybe feel like team lost sight trying build
They long backlog cranking way feel right
You still building wrong least awful lot work build right one
Maybe course exactly need
You business person idea product product manager trying meet customer increasing demand new feature programmer struggling unrealistic deadline
If want deliver value le software need course
You technical programmer tester trouble understanding supposed help build
Either build wrong thing much right thing find late done something simpler
You suspect could deliver value effort stakeholder happening
You need course
You startup everyone happily going fast breaking stuff
You course survive learning fly stage worried enough cash stand foot want develop strategy discipline worse fellow realise much extra discipline need stay business
You need course
A company whose software product I rely run business asked Net Promoter Score question I rated product
I told I could combine look feel competitor feature I rate
When one customer service representative asked detail I sent thorough description I needed using Persona describing specific business goal even writing
They loved
They told This valuable feedback I cut pasted entire message sent CEO Head Product
Wouldn like cultivate relationship like people asking feature people delivering
This training get way
You option You want make good investment people know need training invest thousand dollar course without giving people slack need apply learn cruel
Now granted mean act cruelly J

A computer program typically used provide form consists primarily set rule behavior
These rule termed basic found useful
A production system provides mechanism necessary execute production order achieve goal system
Productions consist two part sensory precondition IF statement action THEN
If production precondition match current world production said
If production action said
A production system also contains database sometimes called maintains data current state knowledge rule interpreter
The rule interpreter must provide mechanism prioritizing production one triggered
Rule interpreter generally execute algorithm selecting production execute meet current goal include updating system data
The condition portion rule LHS tested current state working memory
In idealized production system assumption triggered condition executed consequent action RHS update agent knowledge removing adding data working memory
The system stop processing either user interrupt forward chaining loop given number cycle performed halt RHS executed rule LHSs true
expert system contrast often choose mutually exclusive production since action take time one action taken case expert system recommended
In system rule interpreter cycle two step matching production rule database followed selecting matched rule apply executing selected action
Production system may vary expressive power condition production rule
Accordingly algorithm collect production rule matched condition may range rule sequence stopping first optimized rule compiled network condition
The latter illustrated algorithm designed used series production system called OPS originally developed culminating early eighty
may viewed programming language production system programming
Production system may also differ final selection production rule execute
The collection rule resulting previous matching algorithm called selection process also called
Here strategy may vary order production rule written assign weight priority production rule sort conflict set conflict set according time production rule previously fired according extent modification induced RHSs
Whichever conflict resolution strategy implemented method indeed crucial efficiency correctness production system
Some system simply fire matching production
The use production system varies simple string rule modeling human cognitive process term rewriting reduction system
This example show set production rule reversing string alphabet contain symbol used marker symbol
In example production rule chosen testing according order production list
For rule input string examined left right moving window find match LHS production rule
When match found matched substring input string replaced RHS production rule
In production system x matching character input string alphabet
Matching resume replacement made
The string ABC instance undergoes following sequence transformation production rule In simple system ordering production rule crucial
Often lack control structure make production system difficult design
It course possible add control structure production system model namely inference engine working memory
In toy simulation world monkey room grab different object climb others example production rule grab object suspended ceiling would look like In example data working memory structured variable appear angle bracket
The name data structure goal first literal condition field structure prefixed
The indicates negative condition
Production rule apply instance data structure match condition conform variable binding
In example several object suspended ceiling different ladder nearby supporting monkey conflict set would contain many production rule instance derived production Holds
The conflict resolution step would later select production instance fire
Note binding variable resulting pattern matching LHS used RHS refer data modified
Note also working memory contains explicit control structure data form goal data structure instance
In example monkey hold suspended object status goal set satisfied production rule longer apply first condition fails

One ingredient Scrum practice known
Sashimi Japanese delicacy consisting thin slice raw fish
Each slice complete complete taste similar way every slice taste
Scrum us sashimi technique require every slice functionality created developer complete
All requirement gathering analysis design work coding testing documentation constitute complete product required completed every demonstrated Sprint increment functionality
Sprints kept short enough stakeholder lose interest project Sprints completed
And stakeholder see opportunity redirect project start every Sprint optimize value derive project
At end every Sprint stakeholder see new functionality
Models requirement internal artifact might use developer never shown stakeholder

In computer pipeline continuous somewhat overlapped movement arithmetic step taken processor perform instruction
Pipelining use pipeline
Without pipeline computer processor get first instruction memory performs operation call go get next instruction memory forth
While fetching getting instruction arithmetic part processor idle
It must wait get next instruction
With pipelining computer architecture allows next instruction fetched processor performing arithmetic operation holding close processor instruction operation performed
The staging instruction fetching continuous
The result increase number instruction performed given time period
Pipelining sometimes compared manufacturing assembly line different part product assembled time although ultimately may part assembled others
Even sequential dependency overall process take advantage operation proceed concurrently
Computer processor pipelining sometimes divided instruction pipeline arithmetic pipeline
The instruction pipeline represents stage instruction moved processor including fetched perhaps buffered executed
The arithmetic pipeline represents part arithmetic operation broken overlapped performed
Pipelines pipelining also apply computer memory controller moving data various memory staging place

The element pipeline often executed parallel fashion case amount often inserted element
pipeline include Pipelining natural concept everyday life

Consider assembly car assume certain step assembly line install engine install hood install wheel order arbitrary interstitial step
A car assembly line one three step done
After car engine installed move hood installed leaving engine installation facility available next car
The first car move wheel installation second car hood installation third car begin engine installed
If engine installation take minute hood installation take minute wheel installation take minute finishing three car one car assembled would take minute
On hand using assembly line total time complete three minute
At point additional car come assembly line minute increment
A linear pipeline processor series processing stage memory access
A pipelining also called dynamic pipeline configured perform various function different time
In dynamic pipeline also connection
A pipeline also allows long instruction word
As example show pipelining decrease time processing single datum increase system processing stream data
A deeper pipeline increase every additional stage
Latency time required signal propagate stage pipeline start finish
A pipelined system typically requires resource circuit element processing unit computer memory etc
one executes one batch time stage reuse resource previous stage
Moreover pipelining may increase time take instruction finish
A variety situation cause including jump conditional unconditional branch data cache miss
Some processor certain feature designed reduce impact pipeline stall etc
Some processor spend lot energy transistor feature designed reduce impact pipeline stall etc
Some try reduce impact pipeline stall replacing jump code often cost increasing binary file size
One key aspect pipeline design balancing pipeline stage
Using assembly line example could greater time saving engine wheel took minute
Although system would still minute would able output new car every minute
In word pipelined process output finished item rate determined slowest part
Note time taken add engine could reduced minute would make difference stable output rate component increased production time minute
Another design consideration provision adequate buffering pipeline stage especially processing time irregular data item may created destroyed along pipeline
To observe scheduling pipeline static dynamic reservation table used
A reservation table linear static pipeline generated easily data flow follows linear stream static pipeline performs specific operation
But case dynamic pipeline pipeline pattern followed multiple reservation table generated different function
The reservation table mainly display time space flow data pipeline function
Different function reservation table follow different path
The number column reservation table specifies evaluation time given function
Conventional microprocessor use buffered synchronous pipeline
In pipeline pipeline inserted pipeline stage synchronously
The time clock signal set greater longest delay pipeline stage register clocked data written final result previous stage
Asynchronous pipeline used pipeline register clocked asynchronously
Generally speaking use system wherein stage detect finished
When stage Si ready transmit sends ready signal stage
After stage receives incoming data return acknowledgement signal Si
The example microprocessor us buffered asynchronous pipeline
Unbuffered pipeline called wave pipeline register pipeline stage
Instead delay pipeline balanced stage difference first stabilized output data last minimized
Thus data flow wave pipeline wave kept short synchronous possible
The maximum rate data fed wave pipeline determined maximum difference delay first piece data coming pipe last piece data given wave
If data fed faster possible wave data interfere

In consists chain processing element arranged output element input next name analogy physical
Usually amount provided consecutive element
The information flow pipeline often element pipeline may called also called
Connecting element pipeline analogous
Narrowly speaking pipeline linear though sometimes term applied general flow
For example primarily pipeline may communication direction known pipeline may fully
Flows tree topology behave similarly linear pipeline lack cycle make simple thus may loosely referred pipeline
Pipelines often implemented launching element time process automatically servicing data read request process data written upstream process called In way naturally switched among process minimize idle time
In common model element implemented lightweight thread coroutines reduce OS overhead often involved process
Depending upon OS thread may scheduled directly OS thread manager
Coroutines always scheduled coroutine manager form
Usually read write request blocking operation mean execution source process upon writing suspended data could written destination process likewise execution destination process upon reading suspended least requested data could obtained source process
This lead process would wait indefinitely respond since least one two process soon thereafter request serviced operating system continue run
For performance operating system implementing pipe use pipe allow source process provide data destination process currently able willing receive
Under Unices operating system special command also available implement pipe buffer potentially much larger configurable size typically called buffer
This command useful destination process significantly slower source process anyway desired source process complete task soon possible
source process consists command read audio track destination process consists command compress audio data format like
In case buffering entire track pipe buffer would allow CD drive spin quickly enable user remove CD drive encoding process finished
Such buffer command implemented using reading writing data
Wasteful avoided using facility
Some notable example pipeline software system include port pipeline idea system
It support much complex pipeline structure Unix shell step taking multiple input stream producing multiple output stream
Such functionality supported Unix kernel program use make complicated syntax blocking mode although shell support via arbitrary assignment
Traditional application program IBM mainframe operating system standard input output stream allow redirection piping
Instead spawning process external program CMS Pipelines feature lightweight dispatcher concurrently execute instance program run pipeline
More program implement typical UNIX utility interface device operating system service
In addition program CMS Pipelines defines framework allow program input output stream used pipeline
Data IBM mainframe typically resides connected device operate record mode rather stream mode
As consequence data CMS Pipelines handled record mode
For text file record hold one line text
In general CMS Pipelines buffer data pass record data fashion one program next
This ensures deterministic flow data network interconnected pipeline
Beside byte pipeline also object pipeline
In object pipeline processing element output object instead text
includes internal object pipeline transfer object function within PowerShell runtime
found example metaphor
Graphical environment also make use pipeline
Rather providing save containing let user specify write data RISC OS ROX provide save dialog box containing field specify name
The destination specified icon
The user drop icon anywhere file could dropped including onto icon program
If icon dropped onto program icon loaded content would otherwise saved passed new program standard input stream
For instance user browsing might come across compressed image want edit
Using GUI pipeline could drag link program drag icon representing extracted content edit open save dialog drag icon uploading software
Conceptually method could used conventional save dialog box would require user program obvious easily accessible location filesystem navigated
In practice often case GUI pipeline rare
The name come rough analogy physical plumbing pipeline usually allows information flow one direction like water often flow pipe
Pipes viewed form using byte stream data object specifically seen particular form
The concept pipeline also central web development Standards implementation allows source stream modified eventual display
This pattern encourages use text stream input output program
This reliance text accounted creating shell text program

A useful method demonstrating laundry analogy
Let say four load dirty laundry need washed dried folded
We could put first load washer minute dry minute take minute fold clothes
Then pick second load wash dry fold repeat third fourth load
Supposing started PM worked efficiently possible would still laundry midnight
Source Source A RISC processor pipeline operates much way although stage pipeline different
While different processor different number step basically variation five used MIPS processor If glance back diagram laundry pipeline notice although washer finish half hour dryer take extra ten minute thus wet clothes must wait ten minute dryer free
Thus length pipeline dependent length longest step
Because RISC instruction simpler used processor called CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer conducive pipelining
While CISC instruction varied length RISC instruction length fetched single operation
Ideally stage RISC processor pipeline take clock cycle processor finish instruction clock cycle average one cycle per instruction CPI
In practice however RISC processor operate one cycle per instruction
The processor might occasionally stall result data dependency branch instruction
A data dependency occurs instruction depends result previous instruction
A particular instruction might need data register yet stored since job preceeding instruction yet reached step pipeline
For example In example first instruction tell processor add content register store result register
The second instructs add store sum
We place set instruction pipeline
When second instruction second stage processor attempting read register
Remember though first instruction one step ahead second content added result yet written register
The second instruction therefore read register written yet must wait data need stored
Consequently pipeline stalled number empty instruction known go pipeline
Data dependency affect long pipeline shorter one since take longer period time instruction reach final stage long pipeline
MIPS solution problem code reordering
If example following instruction nothing first two code could rearranged instruction executed two dependent instruction pipeline could flow efficiently
The task code reordering generally left compiler recognizes data dependency attempt minimize performance stall
Branch instruction tell processor make decision next instruction executed based result another instruction
Branch instruction troublesome pipeline branch conditional result instruction yet finished path pipeline
For example The example instructs processor add put result subtract storing difference
In third instruction beq stand branch equal
If content equal processor execute instruction labeled Loop
Otherwise continue next instruction
In example processor make decision branch take neither value written register yet
The processor could stall sophisticated method dealing branch instruction branch prediction
The processor make guess path take guess wrong anything written register must cleared pipeline must started correct instruction
Some method branch prediction depend stereotypical behavior
Branches pointing backward taken time since branch often found bottom loop
On hand branch pointing forward taken approximately time
Thus would logical processor always follow branch point backward point forward
Other method branch prediction le static processor use dynamic prediction keep history branch us predict future branch
These processor correct prediction time
Still processor forgo entire branch prediction ordeal
The RISC fetch start decoding instruction side branch
When determines branch followed sends correct instruction pipeline executed
In order make processor even faster various method optimizing pipeline devised
Superpipelining refers dividing pipeline step
The pipe stage faster pipeline stage shorter
Ideally pipeline five stage five time faster processor rather pipeline one stage
The instruction executed speed stage completed stage take one fifth amount time instruction take
Thus processor pipeline MIPS even faster counterpart
The MIPS chop pipeline piece dividing step two
Instruction fetching example done two stage rather one
The stage shown Superscalar pipelining involves multiple pipeline parallel
Internal component processor replicated launch multiple instruction pipeline stage
The RISC forked pipeline different path integer instruction
If mixture type program processor keep fork running simultaneously
Both type instruction share two initial stage Instruction Fetch Instruction Dispatch fork
Often however superscalar pipelining refers multiple copy pipeline stage In term laundry would mean four washer four dryer four people fold clothes
Many today machine attempt find two six instruction execute every pipeline stage
If instruction dependent however first instruction instruction issued
Dynamic pipeline capability schedule around stall
A dynamic pipeline divided three unit instruction fetch decode unit five ten execute functional unit commit unit
Each execute unit reservation station act buffer hold operand operation
While functional unit freedom execute order instruction commit unit must operate maintain simple pipeline behavior
When instruction executed result calculated commit unit decides safe store result
If stall occurs processor schedule instruction executed stall resolved
This coupled efficiency multiple unit executing instruction simultaneously make dynamic pipeline attractive alternative

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I follow course CPU architecture I making exercise moment
Now I encountered word depth pipeline one exercise I know meant depth pipeline
Is number stage pipeline something else
I ca find anywhere syllabus
I think depth measure overlapping instruction number stage hardware constant
When increase number stage usually make CPU faster dimishing margin
See book
The stage larger depth stated optimal number stage optimal depth According
Hrishikeshi et
al
International Symposium Computer Architecture The difference pipeline depth pipeline stage Optimal Logic Depth Per Pipeline Stage Inverter Delays
In decreasing amount logic per pipeline stage increase pipeline depth turn reduces IPC due increased branch misprediction penalty functional unit latency
In addition reducing amount logic per pipeline stage reduces amount useful work per cycle affecting overhead associated latch clock skew jitter
Therefore shorter pipeline stage cause overhead become greater fraction clock period reduces effective frequency gain

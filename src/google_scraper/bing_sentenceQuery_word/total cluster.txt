The department provides Beowulf cluster known user need high performance computing HPC cluster environment order perform work
The primary way using cluster submit batch job description resource requirement CPU RAM run time scheduler
When resource available job run
Access ionic cluster restricted current member CS department CS account alumnus limited guest account ineligible
Before attempting use cluster important join mailing list visiting link This mailing list used announce outage update cluster
More importantly joining list get added access list necessary schedule job Slurm scheduler
It also place user coordinate usage critical time conference deadline
See section detail
The cluster accessible user CS department
If interested using cluster used collaboratively user CS department OIT several cluster available
The heterogeneous cluster comprised server hardware variety source
It currently occupies three rack CS section University Data Center
Each server also called run Linux one server designated node
All server node
Each physical rack cluster contains Ethernet switch
As top position rack called unimaginatively
Each server Ethernet uplink TOR switch
The TOR switch rack contains head node Ethernet uplink department core switch
The core switch turn path CS storage system access home directory project space
Racks contain head node link TOR switch TOR switch rack contain head node
As mentioned ionic cluster heterogeneous
Typically server added year older server removed either due failure extreme old age
As result cluster contains server varying specification
The best source information hardware specification node Ganglia page cluster file system node
If need specific detail physical characteristic server available via Ganglia filesystem node contact CS Staff
As March ionic cluster consists combination Fujitsu Primergy system node Fujitsu Primergy system node NVidia GPUs Fujitsu Primergy system node SuperMicro system node Dell PowerEdge system node
The cluster us Fujitsu Primergy server head node
All system compute node
The SuperMicro system part set added cluster
These system CPU core GB RAM available user cluster
They purchased cost sharing arrangement Computer Vision Group CS Department
In addition CPUs donation Intel Kai Li
The Dell PowerEdge system added cluster March
Each node consists CPU core GB RAM scheduleable department user job walltime one hour le
These node contributed Ben Raphael
Compute node cluster access three type disk storage The storage intended used stage input file read multiple time well intermediate file
By convention use create use subdirectory username The local cluster storage considered scratch user expected clean file end job
Nodes fail one reason another often without warning resulting loss data stored partition
Given nature cluster network topology possible poorly designed job overwhelm network connection back file system
If job need access remote file multiple time data fit local disk encourage structure code first copy data node access locally
This result increased performance job job running cluster well
If timing code aware accessing file system introduces latency uncertainty
Be sure time computation otherwise measuring may dominated contention Ethernet switch node NFS server NFS server SAN switch disk array disk array
The cluster built using formerly PUIAS Linux distribution clone recompile RedHat Enterprise Linux rebranding
Scheduling done MPICH LAM library collection use cluster environment also installed cluster
version parallel toolkit also available
It worth noting license cluster toolkit able use toolkit achieve higher parallelism
To find available software please check page
If need software package library currently installed compute node please contact CS Staff
If already available repository RPM distribution able install within one business day
Packages available RPM take longer prepare automated configuration management system
Please note might globally install highly specialized package unlikely used others department package conflict already installed package
In case may need install locally home directory project space access
We recommend read information submitting managing job
The scheduler assign job resource using information available
Note assign priority user group
As result time especially near conference deadline user may need coordinate amongst
For example request others hold submitting job day
To use cluster simply using CS username password
This put head node home directory
From submit job Slurm scheduler using command single process job combine MPI job
Details
The head node may used interactive work file editing
The head node may used computationally intensive process
As computational software completely absent head node
It possible get email notification job begin end abort
If submit many job short period time make sure email account prepared receive
That make sure sufficient space Inbox email provider accept message potentially high rate
The CS email system accept message cluster high rate
Because external site frequently blacklist throttle mail server inundated message high rate must send cluster email notification
If forwarding CS Princeton email account external provider Gmail please set filter way prevent forwarding message cluster
These message identified sender address slurm
Those job send large amount output STDOUT STDERR redirect output appropriately job submission script
Otherwise compute node spooling space may fill causing running job fail preventing new job starting
The cluster may brought hardware failure maintenance
Long running job designed regularly checkpoint state resumed event interruption without start entire job
There number different job type run cluster including MPI job single processor job interactive job
These type discussed detail
MPI job run single application multiple CPUs using MPI library call coordinate processing among different CPUs
Single processor job name implies run single CPU
Both job typically initiated creating job file shell script
Interactive job allow user run computationally intensive interactive program cluster developing workload batch job
Jobs submitted cluster using command
The job script always run user current working directory
The submission directory available running job environment variable
Additional shell environment variable maintained scheduling system available script runtime
For list variable see page command
Yes job exceeds requested walltime killed scheduler
If request walltime default hour
The maximum walltime request given job hour one week
For reason good idea ensure job checkpointing capability job killed fails reason lose work already performed
If wish use GPU board must specify need GPU resource using option specify many GPU device job need
Therefore sbatch option like request GPU node GPU capability
Please ensure GPU code respect variable binding GPU mechanism GPUs scheduled allocated
Jobs found using GPUs allocated may killed
Interactive job ionic cluster initiated command head node
You may also want specify resource quantity Please use salloc run interactive job rather mechanism
Using mechanism start interactive job lead failure job accounting making appear though job running extremely inefficiently
Interactive job used troubleshooting mechanism creating batch submission work
If need help forming work batch submission please contact CS Staff happy help
We also ask avoid squatting compute node opening long interactive session without actively using since tie cluster resource could performing work user
Accordingly please make sure exit session finished
Interactive job appear idle long period time may cancelled CS Staff job queue waiting use resource
MPI job ionic cluster executed using command
Here example MPI job submission script
This script assumes script file MPI program binary directory
It specifies hour wall clock time processor node total CPUs
Be sure replace actual email address
Single processor job essentially program wish run batch mode
Just anything would program shell script done single processor job ionic cluster
Of course simplest form job one run single program
You notice job script similar one used MPI job
Again sure replace actual email address
In addition walltime node specify maximum amount physical virtual memory single process job likely use
Using output email add either per node option script
The last line output job completion email includes amount memory used job
If report job used something GB physical memory could modify script line like For future run job modification give scheduler hint job expected use memory
If single processor job need run multiple time exactly command argument like get away single job script command modify line replicate job
The example script run instance command single CPU different node
As example sure replace actual email address
The result script getting submitted using get run different machine
The major problem likely encounter job start job terminate unexpectedly
The first thing look diagnosing job problem STDIN STDOUT output job
Unless direct elsewhere STDIN STDOUT written file named
Another command useful diagnosis command
This command provides accounting information may helpful diagnosing unexpected behavior
Try command like

A computer cluster single logical unit consisting multiple computer linked LAN
The networked computer essentially act single much powerful machine
A computer cluster provides much faster processing speed larger storage capacity better data integrity superior reliability wider availability resource
Computer cluster however much costly implement maintain
This result much higher running overhead compared single computer
Many organization use computer cluster maximize processing time increase database storage implement faster data storing retrieving technique
There many type computer cluster including The major advantage using computer cluster clear organization requires large scale processing

Computer cluster may configured different purpose ranging general purpose business need support scientific calculation
In either case cluster may use approach
Note attribute described exclusive computer cluster may also use approach
cluster configuration share computational workload provide better overall performance
For example web server cluster may assign different query different node overall response time optimized
However approach may significantly differ among application
cluster used scientific computation would balance load different algorithm cluster may use simple assigning new request different node
Computer cluster used purpose rather handling operation web service database

In context hardware act disproving intended underlying system respect certain property using
Formal verification helpful proving correctness system internal memory software expressed source code
The verification system done providing abstract system correspondence mathematical model nature system otherwise known construction
Examples mathematical object often used model system formal semantics programming language
One approach formation consists systematically exhaustive exploration mathematical model possible also infinite model infinite set state effectively represented finitely using abstraction taking advantage symmetry
Usually consists exploring state transition model using smart abstraction technique consider whole group state single operation reduce computing time
Implementation technique include symbolic state space enumeration
The property verified often described LTL PSL Assertions SVA CTL
The great advantage model checking often fully automatic primary disadvantage general scale large system symbolic model typically limited hundred bit state explicit state enumeration requires state space explored relatively small
Another approach deductive verification
It consists generating system specification possibly annotation collection mathematical truth imply conformance system specification discharging obligation using either interactive theorem provers automatic theorem provers SMT solver
This approach disadvantage typically requires user understand detail system work correctly convey information verification system either form sequence theorem proved form specification system component
function procedure perhaps subcomponents loop data structure
Formal verification software program involves proving program satisfies formal specification behavior
Subareas formal verification include deductive verification see
A promising verification approach type function include least part function specification code establishes correctness specification
Fully featured dependently typed language support deductive verification special case
Another complementary approach efficient code produced specification series step
An example approach approach seen another form
These technique meaning verified property logically deduced semantics meaning guarantee
A sound technique yield result searched entire space possibility
An example unsound technique one search subset possibility instance integer certain number give result
Techniques also meaning algorithmic implementation guaranteed terminate answer undecidable meaning may never terminate
Because bounded unsound technique often likely decidable sound one
one aspect testing product fitness purpose
Validation complementary aspect
Often one refers overall checking process
The verification process consists aspect
software product one inspect source code static run specific test case dynamic
Validation usually done dynamically product tested putting typical atypical usage Does satisfactorily meet

area dedicated understanding different aspect
The study automated reasoning help produce allow computer reason completely nearly completely automatically
Although automated reasoning considered also connection even
The developed subareas automated reasoning le automated pragmatic subfield viewed guaranteed correct reasoning fixed assumption
Extensive work also done reasoning
Other important topic include reasoning reasoning
An important part uncertainty field argumentation constraint minimality consistency applied top standard automated deduction
John Pollock OSCAR system example automated argumentation system specific automated theorem prover
Tools technique automated reasoning include classical logic calculus reasoning large number le formal technique
The development played big role field automated reasoning led development
A proof every logical inference checked back fundamental mathematics
All intermediate logical step supplied without exception
No appeal made intuition even translation intuition logic routine
Thus formal proof le intuitive le susceptible logical error
Some consider Cornell Summer meeting brought together large number logician computer scientist origin automated reasoning
Others say began program Newell Shaw Simon Martin Davis implementation proved sum two even number even
Automated reasoning although significant popular area research went eighty early ninety
Luckily got revived
For example started using many internal project planning include logical specification checking language version Visual milestone work written
Principia Mathematica also meaning written purpose derive term
Principia Mathematica initially published three volume
LT first ever program developed mimic human reasoning proving theorem demonstrated theorem chapter two Principia Mathematica proving
In addition proving theorem program found proof one theorem elegant one provided Whitehead Russell
After unsuccessful attempt publishing result Newell Shaw Herbert reported publication Automated reasoning commonly used build automated theorem provers
Oftentimes however theorem provers require human guidance effective generally qualify
In case provers come new approach proving theorem
good example
The program came proof one theorem efficient requiring fewer step proof provided Whitehead Russell
Automated reasoning program applied solve growing number problem formal logic mathematics computer science software hardware verification many others
The Sutcliffe Suttner library problem updated regular basis
There also competition among automated theorem provers held regularly conference Pelletier Sutcliffe Suttner problem competition selected TPTP library

Page Validation verification two way check data entered computer correct
entered incorrectly little use
automatic computer check ensure data entered sensible reasonable
It check accuracy data
For example secondary school student likely aged
The computer programmed accept number
This check
However guarantee number typed correct
For example student age might entered valid incorrect
There number validation type used check data entered
Page Activity Find validating verifying data
Links Bringing gadget galore

In definition computer architecture involves design design
The first documented computer architecture correspondence describing
When building computer described two patent application future project machine instruction could stored storage used data
concept
Two early important example The term architecture computer literature traced work Lyle Johnson Mohammad Usman Khan member Machine Organization department IBM main research center
Johnson opportunity write proprietary research communication time known Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
To describe level detail discussing luxuriously embellished computer noted description format instruction type hardware parameter speed enhancement level system architecture term seemed useful machine Subsequently Brooks Stretch designer started Chapter book Planning Computer System Project Stretch ed
Buchholz writing Computer architecture like architecture art determining need user structure designing meet need effectively possible within economic technological constraint
Brooks went help develop called line computer architecture became noun defining user need know
Later computer user came use term many way
The earliest computer architecture designed paper directly built final hardware form
Later computer architecture prototype physically built form TTL prototype tweaked committing final hardware form
As new computer architecture typically built tested computer architecture inside FPGA committing final hardware form
The discipline computer architecture three main subcategories There type computer architecture
The following type used bigger company like Intel count computer architecture The purpose design computer maximizes performance keeping power consumption check cost low relative amount expected performance also reliable
For many aspect considered includes instruction set design functional organization logic design implementation
The implementation involves integrated circuit design packaging power cooling
Optimization design requires familiarity compiler operating system logic design packaging
An instruction set architecture ISA interface computer software hardware also viewed programmer view machine
Computers understand Java programming language used
A processor understands instruction encoded numerical fashion usually
Software tool translate high level language instruction processor understand
Besides instruction ISA defines item computer available
memory
Instructions locate available item register index name memory addressing mode
The ISA computer usually described small instruction manual describes instruction encoded
Also may define short vaguely mnemonic name instruction
The name recognized software development tool called
An assembler computer program translates form ISA form
also widely available usually software program isolate correct malfunction binary computer program
ISAs vary quality completeness
A good ISA compromise programmer convenience easy code understand size code much code required specific action cost computer interpret instruction complexity mean space needed disassemble instruction speed computer larger disassemblers come longer disassemble time
For example ISAs like ISA subtracts one value value zero value return higher value inexpensive fast however ISAs like convenient helpful looking size ISA
Memory organization defines instruction interact memory memory interacts
During design software emulator run program written proposed instruction set
Modern emulator measure size cost speed determine particular ISA meeting goal
Computer organization help optimize product
For example software engineer need know processing power processor
They may need optimize software order gain performance lowest price
This require quite detailed analysis computer organization
For example SD card designer might need arrange card data processed fastest possible way
Computer organization also help plan selection processor particular project
Multimedia project may need rapid data access virtual machine may need fast interrupt
Sometimes certain task need additional component well
For example computer capable running virtual machine need hardware memory different virtual computer kept separated
Computer organization feature also affect power consumption processor cost
Once instruction set designed practical machine must developed
This design process called
Implementation usually considered architectural design rather hardware
Implementation broken several step For entire implementation process organized differently often referred
The exact form computer system depends constraint goal
Computer architecture usually trade standard power versus performance cost memory capacity latency amount time take information one node travel source throughput
Sometimes consideration feature size weight reliability expandability also factor
The common scheme depth power analysis figure keep power consumption low maintaining adequate performance
Modern computer performance often described IPC instruction per
This measure efficiency architecture clock frequency
Since faster rate make faster computer useful measurement
Older computer IPC count low
Simple modern processor easily reach near processor may reach three five IPC executing several instruction per clock cycle
Counting machine language instruction would misleading varying amount work different ISAs
The instruction standard measurement count ISA actual machine language instruction unit measurement usually based speed computer architecture
Many people used measure computer speed clock rate usually MHz GHz
This refers cycle per second main clock CPU
However metric somewhat misleading machine higher clock rate may necessarily greater performance
As result manufacturer moved away clock speed measure performance
Other factor influence speed mix speed available memory type order instruction program
There two main type speed latency throughput
Latency time start process completion
Throughput amount work done per unit time
guaranteed maximum response time system electronic event like disk drive finish moving data
Performance affected wide range design choice example processor usually make latency worse make throughput better
Computers control machinery usually need low interrupt latency
These computer operate environment fail operation completed specified amount time
For example brake must begin braking within predictable short time brake pedal sensed else failure brake occur
take factor account measuring time computer take run series test program
Although benchmarking show strength choose computer
Often measured machine split different measure
For example one system might handle scientific application quickly another might render video game smoothly
Furthermore designer may target add special feature product hardware software permit specific benchmark execute quickly offer similar advantage general task
Power efficiency another important measurement modern computer
A higher power efficiency often traded lower speed higher cost
The typical measurement referring power consumption computer architecture million instruction per second per watt
Modern circuit le power required per transistor number transistor per chip grows
This transistor put new chip requires power supply requires new pathway built power
However number transistor per chip starting increase slower rate
Therefore power efficiency starting become important important fitting transistor single chip
Recent processor design shown emphasis put focus power efficiency rather cramming many transistor single chip possible
In world embedded computer power efficiency long important goal next throughput latency
Increases publicly released refresh rate grown slowly past year respect vast leap power consumption reduction miniaturization demand
This led new demand longer battery life reduction size due mobile technology produced greater rate
This change focus greater refresh rate power consumption miniaturization shown significant reduction power consumption much reported Intel release dropped power consumption benchmark watt watt
Comparing processing speed increase GHz GHz seen focus research development shifting away refresh rate moving towards consuming le power taking le space

Outline architecture central processing unit CPU function arithmetic logic unit ALU control unit CU register within CPU
A major defining point history computing realisation data instruction manipulate data logically could stored place
The computer design built upon principle became known still basis computer today
Although name honour John von Neumann brilliant mathematician worked construction atomic bomb idea probably originated Presper Echkert John Mauchly two early pioneer worked ENIAC Moore School University Pennsylvania time period
Another major characteristic von Neumann architecture unit process information separate unit store information
This characteristic lead following component von Neumann architecture
Memory collection cell unique physical address
We use generic word cell rather byte number bit addressable location called memory varies one machine another
Today computer byte addressable
To fully illustrate concept memory take computer RAM example
The memory consists byte mean byte computer uniquely addressable machine bit
The cell memory numbered consecutively beginning
For example cell memory cell would addressed follows What content address
The bit pattern stored location
However content actually represents instruction value sign etc
discussed later
What important however understand bit pattern information interpreted
When referring bit byte word bit numbered right left beginning zero
The bit address numbered follows The capable performing basic arithmetic operation adding subtracting multiplying dividing two number
This unit also capable performing logical operation
The operates word natural unit data associated particular computer design
Historically word length computer number bit processed
However current Intel line processor blurred definition defining word length bit
The processor work word bit double word bit quadwords bit
In rest wiki referring word historical nature aforementioned
Most modern small number special storage unit called
These register contain one word used store information needed immediately
For example calculation
first added result multiplied
Rather storing result adding memory retrieving multiply result left register content register multiplied
Access register much faster access memory location
All computing power world would useful one could input value calculation outside report outside result said calculation
Input output unit channel computer communicates outside world
An device data program outside world entered computer
The first input unit interpreted hole punched paper tape card
input device however include limited keyboard mouse camera also known simply webcam scanning device
An device result stored computer memory made available outside world
Examples include printer screen monitor
The organising force computer charge
There two special register control unit
The contains instruction executed contains address next instruction executed
Because control unit work closely together often thought one unit called
Above simplified view flow information part von Neumann machine
The part connected one another collection wire called bus data travel computer
Each bus carry three kind information address data control
An address used select memory location device data go taken
Data flow bus CPU memory Devices
The control information used manage flow address data
For example control signal typically used determine direction data flowing either CPU
The number bit transfer simultaneously
The wider bus address data bit move
Explain use cache memory
Because memory access time consuming relative speed processor many architecture provide
Cache memory small amount memory copy frequently used data stored
Before main memory access made CPU check whether data stored cache memory
another technique used speed
This technique split instruction smaller step overlapped
In personal computer component von Neumann machine reside physically printed circuit board called
The motherboard also connection attaching device bus mouse keyboard additional storage device
So mean say machine processor
The variable usually refers number bit CPU general register Two number added single instruction
It also refer width bus size addressable always
In addition refer width data always
Explain machine instruction cycle
Before looking computer let u look
The definition computer outline capability computer electronic device store retrieve process data
Therefore instruction give computer relate storing retrieving processing data
The underlying principle von Neumann machine data instruction stored memory treated alike
This mean instruction data addressable
Instructions stored contiguous memory location data manipulated stored together different part memory
To start Cycle first data loaded main memory operating system address first instruction placed onto
The process cycle includes four step The increment one one point next instruction executed control unit go address memory address register hold address next instruction specified take main memory address bus return memory buffer register via data bus
The MBR two way register temporarily hold data fetched Memory cache RAM make copy content place copy
At point contains instruction executed
Before going next step cycle must updated hold address next instruction executed current instruction completed
There instruction register responsible instruction solved CU
CU check status instruction allows execution
Because instruction stored contiguously memory adding number byte current instruction put address next instruction
Thus control unit increment
It possible may changed later instruction executed
In case instruction must get additional data memory sends address memory bus memory responds returning value location
In computer data retrieved memory may immediately participate arithmetic logical operation
Other computer simply save data returned memory register processing subsequent instruction
At end execution result instruction may saved either register memory
To execute instruction instruction register control unit determine instruction
It might instruction access data input device send data output device perform operation data value
At phase instruction decoded control signal
That logic circuitry determines operation executed
This step show computer execute instruction expressed machine language
The instruction literally built circuit
The instruction executed may potentially require additional memory access complete task
For example instruction say add content memory location register control unit must get content memory location
Once instruction decoded operand data fetched control unit ready execute instruction
Execution involves sending signal unit carry processing
In case adding number register operand sent added content register
When execution complete cycle begin
If last instruction add value content register next instruction probably say store result place memory
However next instruction might control instruction asks question result last instruction perhaps change content program counter
Hardware changed dramatically last yet von Neumann model remains basis computer today
As Alan Perlis computer scientist said Describe primary memory
RAM stand Memory
RAM memory cell usually byte directly accessed
Inherent idea able access location ability content location
That storing something else place change bit pattern cell
In addition RAM computer contain second kind memory called ROM
ROM stand Memory
The content location ROM changed
Their content permanent altered second operation
Placing bit pattern ROM called
The bit pattern burnt either time ROM manufactured time computer part assembled
RAM ROM differentiated basic property RAM ROM
This mean RAM retain bit configuration power turned ROM
Because ROM stable changed used store instruction computer need start
Frequently used software also stored ROM system read software time machine turned
Main memory usually contains ROM along RAM
Identify need persistent storage
An input device mean data program entered computer stored memory
An output device mean result sent back user
Because main memory volatile limited essential type storage device program data stored longer processed machine turned
These type storage device main memory called storage device
Because data must read written storage device also input output device

Recall executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another cycle
technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform keep track program memory memory reside
Another key operating system concept idea defined program execution
A program static set instruction
A process dynamic entity represents program executed
Through multiprogramming computer system might many active process
The operating system must manage process carefully
At point time specific instruction may next executed
Intermediate value calculated
A process might interrupted execution operating system performs carefully track progress process intermediate state

The following section Single Contiguous Memory Management Partition Memory Management Paged Memory Management interest purpose
The Computer Science Guide clearly note technical detail needed
For example memory management described handled multitasking environment expected
Therefore section serve purpose illustrating memory management technique summarised rather utilised exam
Has operating system one program memory one time
This basic type memory management
The memory broken different part
Has operating system number program running time different partition
The partition base bound register
Base register Bounds register Partition selection First fit Best fit Worst fit A technique process divided page stored memory frame loaded
Frame Page The number system specifies number digit used system
The digit always begin continue one le base
For example digit base
There digit base
There digit base
The base also determines position digit mean
When one add last digit number system one carry digit position left
Numbers written using
The rightmost digit represents value multiplied base zeroth power
The digit left one represents value multiplied base first power
The next digit represents value multiplied base second power
The next digit represents value multiplied base third power
One usually familiar positional notation even aware
One instinctively inclined utilise method calculate number one A formal way defining positional notation say value represented polynomial base number system
But polynomial
A polynomial sum two algebriac term consists constant multiplied one variable raised integral power
When defining positional notation variable base number system
Thus represented polynomial follows acting base To express idea formally number number system digit represented follows represents digit th position number Look complicated
Take concrete example base
Here number exactly digit base
The formula state fifth digit last digit left multiplied base fourth power fourth digit multiplied base third power In previous calculation one assumed number base
This logical assumption generic number system base
However reason number could represent value base
In order distinguish value general notation utilised order represent number base
Therefore number found base system
In order turn turn one simply us previous calculation Therefore base equal base
One must keep mind two number equivalent value
That represent number thing
If one bag contains bean second bag contains bean bag contain exact number bean
The number system allow one represent value various way
Note base rightmost digit one position
In base rightmost digit also one position
In fact true base anything raised power zero one
Why would anyone want represent value base
It done often granted sometimes helpful understand work
For example computing technique called hashing take number scramble one way scramble number interpret different base
Other base base binary particularly important computer processing
The binary number system particularly important computing
It also helpful familiar number system power ase base octal base hexadecimal
Recall base digit base two digit base eight digit
Therefore number could represent value base le digit exist base
It however valid number base base higher
Likewise number valid number base higher simply exist us digit base lower
What digit base higher
One need assign symbol represent digit correspond decimal value beyond
In base higher one generally look towards letter digit
The letter A consequently represent number B represent C represent forth
Therefore digit base Focusing value binary octal hexadecimal represent number base one calculate example decimal equivalent octal base simply put finding
As case expanding number polynomial form adding number And converting hexadecimal number decimal Define Boolean operator AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
Construct truth table using operator
The gate computer sometimes referred logic gate perform one logical function
That gate accepts one input value produce single output value
Because one dealing binary information input output either corresponding signal corresponding signal
The type gate input value determine output value
A NOT gate accepts one input value produce one output value
The table right illustrates NOT gate three way Boolean expression logical diagram symbol using truth table
In representation variable represents input signal either
The variable represents output signal whose value determined value
By definition input value NOT gate output input value output
A NOT gate sometimes referred inverts input value
In Boolean expression NOT operation represented mark value begin negated
Sometimes operation shown horizontal bar value begin negated
In Boolean expression table assigned value determined applying NOT operation input value
In variable left equal sign take value expression side
The logical diagram symbol NOT gate triangle small circle called end
The input output shown line flowing gate
Sometimes line labeled though always
The truth table show possible input value NOT gate well corresponding output value
Because one input signal NOT gate signal two possibility column labelled A truth table
The column labelled show output gate inverse input
Note three representation truth table actually defines behaviour gate situation
These three notation different way representing thing example result Boolean expression always result Boolean expression always
This behaviour consistent value shown truth table
Unlike NOT gate accepts one input signal AND gate accepts two input signal
The value input signal determine output signal
If two input value AND gate output otherwise output
The AND operation Boolean algebra expressed using single dot case asterisk
Often operator assumed example often written
Because two input two possible value input four possible combination provided input AND gate
Therefore four situation occur AND operator used Boolean expression
Likewise truth table showing behaviour AND gate four row showing four possible input combination
Like AND gate two input OR gate
If two input value output value otherwise input
The Boolean algebra OR operation expressed using plus sign
The OR gate two input one two value AND gate four input combination therefore four row truth table
The XOR OR gate illustrated right
An XOR gate produce two input otherwise
Note difference XOR gate OR gate differ one input situation
When input signal OR gate produce XOR produce
Sometimes regular OR gate referred OR produce either input
The XOR produce input mixed one one
Think XOR gate saying When I say I mean one
The Boolean algebra symbol sometimes used express XOR operation
However XOR operation also expressed using operator leave exercise
Note logic diagram symbol XOR gate like symbol OR gate except extra curved line connecting input signal
The NAND NOR gate accept two input value
The NAND NOR gate essentially opposite AND OR gate respectively
That output NAND gate one took output AND gate put inverter NOT gate
There typically specific symbol used express NAND NOR gate operation Boolean algebra
Instead one rely definition express concept
That Boolean algebra expression NAND negation AND operation
Likewise Boolean algebra expression NOR negation OR operation
The logic diagram symbol NAND NOR AND OR except NAND NOR symbol inversion bubble indicate negation
Compare output column truth table AND NAND
They opposite row row
The true OR NOR gate
Six specific type gate observed
It may seem difficult task keep straight remember work
Well probably depends one think
One encouraged try memorise truth table
The processing gate described briefly general term
If one think way one produce appropriate truth table time needed
Some description term input value cause gate produce n output case produce Construct logic diagram using AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
A combinational circuit consists logic gate whose output determined time present combination input irrespective previous consists input variable logic gate output variable
The logic gate accept signal input generate signal example combinational circuit binary adder decimal adder decoder multiplexer half adder half subtractor etc
A logic circuit addition two number called half adder
addition process reproduced truth table

Addressing mode convention used assembly language programming specify certain value read within given segment assembly instruction
There multiple possible mode based two common immediate direct
Immediate addressing mode mean value given instruction assembly programming directly specified
This mean value constant written immediately immutably instruction
The following example format typically found immediate addressing mode Operator Target ValueIn example format value number Value operated value stored Target
Value constant value change matter occurs set assembly instruction
Direct addressing mode mean value given instruction assembly programming pointed given value
This mean value variable based stored memory given address
The following example format typically found direct addressing mode Operator Target Address In example format value memory location Address variable value memory written read course program

The method specifying operand known
Basically three field instruction
Opcode
Address field
Mode field The opcode used specifying operation performed data stored register word
Addressing mode instruction determines way operand chosen
In word specifies rule referencing value operand
The technique reach operand present processor register memory port instruction
For better understanding various addressing mode necessary understand instruction cycle

Instructions fetched

Decoding instruction

Execution instruction
Program Counter PC used keeping track instruction program stored
The address instruction executed next hold PC
The PC incremented instruction fetched
In second phase instruction decoded operand located using instruction
Then instruction executed cycle start fetching next instruction
Following term used discussing
Address A This content address field refers location

Register R This content address field refers register instruction

Program Counter PC It keep track instruction program stored hold address instruction executed

Effective Address EA It refers address operand actually stored
The way specifying address data operation performed known
Some common specified In operand specified instruction
In mode address field instruction contains address operand used
In mode address word referred address field instruction contains full address operand
In mode address field instruction contains address register containing operand used
In mode address register containing full address operand referred address field instruction
In mode combination direct addressing register indirect addressing used
In mode stack pointer used refer address top stack

Immediate Addressing available

This fastest method addressing involve main memory
For example want add content accumulator The instruction Nothing fetched memory instruction simply add accumulator immediately
Immediate Addressing useful carry instruction involving constant opposed variable
For example might want use constant within code

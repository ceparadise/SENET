What difference proxy server reverse proxy server
The previous answer accurate perhaps terse
I try add example
First word proxy describes someone something acting behalf someone else
In computer realm talking one server acting behalf another computer
For purpose accessibility I limit discussion web proxy however idea proxy limited web site
Most discussion web proxy refers type proxy known forward proxy
The proxy event case forward proxy retrieves data another web site behalf original requestee
For example I list three computer connected internet
Normally one would connect directly However scenario better behalf chain follows
Here partial list us forward proxy server
X unable access Z directly Someone administration authority internet connection decided block access site
Examples The Storm Worm virus spreading tricking people visiting system administrator blocked access site prevent user inadvertently infecting
Employees large company wasting much time management want access blocked business hour
A local elementary school disallows internet access web site
A government unable control publishing news control access news instead blocking site
See
b The administrator blocked
Examples The administrator Z noticed hacking attempt coming X administrator decided block X ip address netrange
Z forum web site
spamming forum
Z block X
For example I list three computer connected internet
Normally one would connect directly However scenario better administrator restrict disallow direct access force visitor go Y first
So data retrieved behalf chain follows
What different time compared forward proxy time user know accessing Z user see communicating
The server invisible client reverse proxy visible externally
A reverse proxy requires proxy configuration client side
The client think communicating reality forwarding communication
In scenario ability choose
A pair simple definition would Forward Proxy Acting behalf requestor service consumer Reverse Proxy Acting behalf producer
answer nicely detail application proxy slip fundamental concept forward reverse proxy
For reverse proxy X Y Z X know Y Z rather vice versa
explains difference forward reverse proxy clearly
A proxy simply middleman communication
Client Proxy Server Client proxy Client Proxy Server The proxy act behalf client
Client know machine involved chain
Server
Server proxy Client Proxy Server The proxy act behalf server
Client know proxy
Server know whole chain
Seems simply confusing name proxy
I suggest abandoning former latter explicit communication
Of course complicate matter every machine exclusively client server
If ambiguity context best explicitly specify proxy lie communication tunnel
I found diagram helpful
It show architecture v proxy setup client server Internet
This image help understand post better
You also watch video Peter Silva
Picture Source
All credit person created diagram
It reminded classic proverb A picture worth word
Some diagram might help The difference primarily deployment
Web forward reverse proxy underlying feature accept request HTTP request various format provide response usually accessing origin contact server
Fully featured server usually access control caching feature
A forward proxy proxy accessed configuring client machine
The client need protocol support proxy feature redirection proxy auth etc
The proxy transparent user experience application
A reverse proxy proxy deployed web server behaves like web server exception instead locally composing content program disk forward request origin server
From client perspective IS web server user experience completely transparent
In fact single proxy instance run forward reverse proxy time different client population
That short version I clarify people want comment

So server return response proxy proxy forward response client
In fact server never learn client client IP know proxy
However client definitely know server since essentially format HTTP request destined server hand proxy

It forward request server receives response return response client
In case client never learn actual server server IP exception know proxy
The server wo know actual client depending configuration reverse proxy
A proxy server proxy optionally cache outgoing network request various public resource across Internet
A reverse proxy capture optionally cache incoming request Internet distributes various internal private resource usually High Availability purpose
Best explanation diagram While proxy behalf client requesting host proxy behalf server In effect whereas hide identity client hide identity server An ordinary intermediate server sits client origin server
In order get content origin server client sends request proxy naming origin server target proxy request content origin server return client
A contrast appears client like ordinary web server
No special configuration client necessary
The client make ordinary request content reverse proxy
The reverse proxy decides send request return content origin
A typical usage reverse proxy provide Internet user Reverse proxy also used balance load among several server provide caching slower server
In addition reverse proxy used simply bring several server URL space
info visit This great read understand difference Forward Reverse PROXY A forward proxy hide identity client user whereas reverse proxy hide identity server
As per understanding To start everyone know proxy mean The authority represent someone else
Now two thing Forward Reverse proxy
FORWARD PROXY Suppose want access google google turn n number server respond particular request
Now case requesting something google want google see IP address use forward proxy explained
A B C Now A sending request B So C think request coming B A
In way prevent client IP exposed outer world
REVERSE PROXY
Now case make understand take case forward proxy
Here requested something google turn going send one request app server another proxy server get response
So thing happen explained
A B C A From diagram see request sent C B C one Request send Similarly response go C D B A
The diagram say context matter although proxy acting way client side proxy hiding client information whereas server side proxy hide server side information
Please comment feel explanation wrong
Heres example reverse proxy load balancer
A client surf server hit reverse proxy running
The reverse proxy happens
Pound take request sends one three application server sitting behind
In example Pound load balancer
ie
balancing load three application server
The application server serve website content back client
When computer LAN connect proxy server access internet
Benefits include server exposed internet
People outside unable access computer directly
Forward proxy improve internet access user caching downloads
They also used restrict access certain site
Also proxy server would need public address client connecting
A reverse proxy opposite forward proxy
Instead act proxy behalf server connected
Instead accessing remote server directly user would go reverse proxy get directed appropriate server
Only reverse proxy would need SSL certificate one public IP address would needed handle load balancing incoming request enhance overall user experience
Although understanding apache perspective Proxy mean site x proxy site request x return
The reverse proxy mean response adjusted reference become x
So user tell proxy involved grant client anonymity think Tor
grant back end server anonymity think server behind DMZ
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

I know proxy I sure reverse proxy
It seems probably akin load balancer
Is correct
A reverse proxy also known inbound proxy server receives request Internet forward proxy small set server usually located internal network directly accessible outside
It reverse traditional outbound proxy receives request small set client internal network forward Internet
A reverse proxy used allow authenticated user access intranet even located outside
Users internal network access intranet server directly IP address authentication user outside must authenticate proxy server usually username password order allowed
Yes correct reverse proxy often used load balancing
A reverse proxy present single interface multiple server distributes request server
Its common us load balancing caching
A reverse proxy used provide security internal resource
Two common one Microsoft ISA server Apache
As example Microsoft Exchange server internal LAN want give access internet user Outlook Web Access OWA could place server DMZ NOT RECOMMENDED open port firewall internal network
With reverse proxy would put reverse proxy DMZ OWA request directed reverse proxy
It take request forward Exchange server acting
With Apache named virtual host reverse proxy multiple site single IP address depending whether SSL involved
This way server data protected still allowing secure access
Reverse Proxies also often used caching resource let generate given page one time per minute instance instead per request
For site important benefit particularly home page many site see traffic go home page
A caching reverse proxy serve static version page transparently end user without need application rewrite
A proxy essentially intermediate transaction request
Standard network usage proxy intermediate protects
request
A reverse proxy intermediate protects request
A transparent proxy protect either side
Other technology load balancing packet filtering caching etc
combined proxy technology noted others improve security performance
A reverse proxy called act proxy request outside LAN
A normal proxy
Squid MS ISA act proxy request within LAN
Normally would use reverse proxy load balancing security
In former case accepts incoming request relatively lightweight process forward request one web server actual work
In latter case used filter request unauthorised source
By posting answer agree

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A proxy server dedicated computer software system running computer act intermediary endpoint device computer another server user client requesting service
The proxy server may exist machine firewall server may separate server forward request
An advantage proxy server cache serve user
If one Internet site frequently requested likely proxy cache improve user response time
A proxy also log interaction helpful
When proxy server receives request Internet resource Web page look local previously page
If find page return user without needing forward request Internet
If page cache proxy server acting client behalf user us one request page server Internet
When page returned proxy server relates original request forward user
Proxy server used legal illegal purpose
In enterprise proxy server used facilitate security administrative control service among purpose
In personal computing context proxy server used enable user
Proxy server also used opposite purpose To monitor traffic undermine user privacy
To user proxy server invisible Internet request returned response appear directly addressed Internet server
The proxy actually invisible IP address specified option browser protocol program
definition continues Users access web proxy online configure web browser constantly use proxy server
Browser setting include automatically detected manual option proxy
Proxy server may serve many user one per server
These option called shared dedicated proxy respectively
There number reason proxy thus number type proxy server often overlapping category
send request client onward web server
Users access forward proxy directly surfing web proxy address configuring Internet setting
Forward proxy allow circumvention firewall increase privacy security user may sometimes used download illegal material copyrighted material child pornography
transparently handle request resource destination server without requiring action part requester
Reverse proxy used Sites might blocked le legitimate reason
Reverse proxy may used prevent access immoral illegal copyrighted content
Sometimes reason justifiable sometimes justification dubious
Reverse proxy sometimes prevent access news site user could view leaked information
They also prevent user accessing site disclose information government industry action
Blocking access website may violate free speech right
definition continues typically found near exit corporate network
These proxy centralize network traffic
On corporate network proxy server associated part server separate network external network typically Internet firewall protects network outside intrusion allows data scanned security purpose delivery client network
These proxy help monitoring administering network traffic computer corporate network usually safe device need anonymity typically mundane task
hide IP address client using allow access material blocked firewall circumvent IP address ban
They may used enhanced privacy protection attack
hide even fact used client present public IP address
So hide IP address client using also allow access site might block proxy server
Examples highly anonymous proxy include
provide proxy service UDP data DNS look operation addition Web traffic
Some proxy server offer Socks protocol
forward domain name service DNS request LANs Internet DNS server caching enhanced speed
In attacker attempt steal hit authentic web page search engine index search result page
The proxy hacker would either fraudulent site emulating original whatever felt like showing client requesting page
Here work The attacker creates copy targeted web page proxy server us method linking copied page external site artificially raise search engine ranking
The authentic page rank lower may seen duplicated content case search engine may remove index
This form hacking also used deliver page malicious intent
Proxy hacking direct user fake banking site example steal account info sold used steal fund account
The attacker also use hack direct user site compromise machine variety nefarious purpose
Some mean developed compromise proxy ability
Specially crafted apps browser plugins used reveal proxy user identity proxy used untrusted site anywhere anonymity important
Website owner suspect victim proxy hack test theory searching phrase would almost uniquely identifying site
Their site prominent search engine result page SERP
If second site content show may proxy page
Proxy server many form enhance security like many thing computing may vulnerable
To prevent attack network intrusion administrator keep software date use load balancing enforce secure authorization authentication block unsolicited traffic malicious open proxy

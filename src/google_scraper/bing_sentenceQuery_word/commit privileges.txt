Photo courtesy Philip Guo started programming I first Logo BASIC
The picture age horrible posture
By time photo taken I already written several BASIC game I distributed shareware local BBS
I fast growing bored parent software engineer gave original grad school day
That I started learning C writing simple interpreter compiler
My early interpreter BASIC time I entered high school I already created nontrivial subset Throughout high school I spent weekend coding assembly obsessed code newly released
When I started freshman year MIT computer science major I already year programming experience
So I felt right home
OK lie
With one exception That photo
When taken I even know
My parent like Quick pose front new computer Look closely
My finger even right position
My parent humanity major single programming book house
In sixth grade I tried teaching BASIC week quit hard
The real exposure I programming prior college taking AP computer science grade taught math teacher learned material
Despite shortcoming class inspired major computer science college
But I started freshman year MIT I felt bit anxious many classmate actually year childhood programming experience I le one
Even though I grow household could code way paper bag I one big thing going I I good programming
Here freshman year college Photo courtesy Philip Guo As Asian male student MIT I fit society image young programmer
Thus throughout college nobody ever said said CS student I knew Although I started complete novice like everyone I never faced impeded intellectual growth
Throughout college grad school I gradually learned via class research internship incrementally taking harder harder project getting better better programming falling deeper deeper love
Instead age I mine age
And nobody ever got way even I looked like sort person would good thing
The software engineer Tess Rinearson writes dynamic different perspective essay Instead facing implicit bias I privilege implicit endorsement
For instance whenever I attended technical meeting people would assume I knew I regardless whether I treat accordingly
If I stared someone silence nodded talking would assume I understood I clueless
Nobody ever talked I always got benefit doubt technical setting
As result I able fake till I made often landing job whose posting required skill I yet learned knew I could pick spot
Most interview research assistantships summer internship quite gave chance try
And enough round practice I actually start knowing I
As I gained experience I able land meaningful programming job led virtuous cycle improvement
For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender
This kind privilege I people looked like possessed silent manifested people said u rather say
We spend enormous amount time developing technical expertise without anyone interference implicit discouragement
Sure worked really hard effort directly translated skill improvement without much loss due interpersonal friction
Because looked part
In contrast ask computer science major majority demographic white Asian male I guarantee encountered discouraging comment You know everyone cut computer They probably still remember word action hurt even though often trying harm
For example one good friend took course freshman year enjoyed
She wanted get better Java GUI programming got summer research assistantship MIT Media Lab
However instead letting build GUI like job ad described supervisor assigned task audio clip summer long
He assigned new male student build GUI application
And like student programming also freshman amount limited experience
The student spent summer getting better GUI programming grinded away mindlessly transcribing audio
As result grew resentful shied away learning CS
Thinking story always anger
Here someone natural interest took initiative learn denied opportunity
I doubt friend could gotten good really enjoyed opportunity I
It help accepted MIT son saying Well got MIT Over decade later programming research job wish learned back college
However negative association everything hard motivate fear shot
One trite retort Well friend tougher given easily
If wanted badly enough tried even knowing might face These sort remark aggravate
Writing code living like Navy SEAL
Programming seriously demanding need superhero enter profession
Just look photo software engineering summer internship Photo courtesy Philip Guo Even though I hacking hardware simulator sound mildly I actually pretty squishy chillin cubicle often taking extended lunch break
All guy around yes programmer men exception one older woman hang u also fairly squishy
These guy made fine living good superheroes
The hardship one guy faced summer staying late playing rolling office next morning
Anyone enough practice motivation could done job programming job well
Seriously company looking hire next Steve want ship code work
It frustrates people majority demographic often need tough nail succeed field constantly bearing lasting effect thousand
according one researcher Mary Rowe In contrast people look like kinda programming work want switch later work quietly suck rock whatever
And nobody make remark appearance whether truly dedicated hacker behavior might reflect badly kind people
silent technical privilege
Ideally want spur interest young people underrepresented demographic might never otherwise think pursue CS STEM study
There great people organization working toward goal
Although I think increased broader participation critical immediate concern reducing attrition already field
For instance according That I plan start taking step encourage retain already want learn
So thought experiment For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender exact initial interest aptitude level
Would still willing devote hour deliberate practice achieve mastery face dozen hundred instance implicit discouragement would inevitably encounter year
Sure outlier would many would
Many u would quit even though potential interest thrive field
As older Black male life go extra mile reach others starting line I could prouder author empathy
I hope live future people already interest pursue CS programming field
I want people experience I privileged enough gotten college beyond unimpeded opportunity develop expertise something find beautiful practical fulfilling

learn share knowledge build career
After reading I decided would good start experimenting GitHub
I thought What better way experiment introductory computer science homework
However practice open solution web I concerned student might plagiarize
I
Thus question come mind I consider practice Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
Does putting homework code GitHub open copied
If create public repository yes
Private repository cost money private repository though pointed free student version Are people plagiarize familiar GitHub
Open source sharing
That kind point
Do store thing want keep private public place
Should I concerned
For general homework
Again put essay personal writing public repository
That would similar putting essay public blog
Would plagiarism detection software scan GitHub I know
Probably eventually
Git used without github
To really learn git need github bitbucket paid service
GitHub public set server work
Git great tracking revision
If ever used Google Docs Google Drive looked history feature probably familiar nice able revisit change old version work
Git formalizes allowing comment commits branch work multiple version experiment without worrying overwriting original work
I read Quora post thought I might add
The best thing improve skill rent server vendor like Rackspace Digital Ocean Linode name provider
These service run little though month typical
From learn configure Linux machine
You install git repository mail server web server whatever want low risk environment
Make mistake reset server virgin state
I recommend installing Ubuntu distro large community relative ease installing new software
One problem developer often dependent sysadmins task really part repertoire
It depends
If repository public anyone see fork
They may even send pull request
If repository private hand seen people allow
You need paid subscription create private repos
That
But IMO always suppose plagiarizer familiar everything
It homework
Why care
It like doctor thesis next patent material
I know software Wikipedia
I would surprised someone made Github
But usually software check whether copied something well known site author original content nothing worry
If people plagiarizing mean good
Last least might want read Creative Commons
Unless really want keep work top secret better use CC license lose night sleep people copying work

In defined delegation authority
A privilege allows user perform action
Examples various privilege include ability create read delete file access read write communicating
Users delegated extra level control called privileged
Users lack privilege defined unprivileged regular normal user
Privileges either automatic granted applied
An automatic privilege exists requirement permission perform action
For example system people required log system use logging require privilege
Systems implement file protection essentially give unlimited privilege perform action file
A granted privilege exists result presenting credential privilege granting authority
This usually accomplished logging system username password supplied correct user granted additional privilege
A privilege applied either executed program issuing request advanced privilege running program apply additional privilege
An example user applying additional privilege provided command run command user authentication system
Modern processor architecture multiple allows OS run different
Some processor two level processor four level least privilege
Tasks tagged privilege level
Resources segment page port etc
privileged instruction tagged demanded privilege level
When task try use resource execute privileged instruction processor determines whether permission protection fault interrupt generated
This prevents user task damaging OS
In computer programming exception related privileged instruction violation may caused array accessed bound invalid pointer dereferenced invalid memory location referenced privileged location one controlling device
This particularly likely occur programming language C use pointer arithmetic check array bound automatically
On system commonly known owns privilege
Ordinary user granted enough permission accomplish common task
UNIX system security feature
Most user set new user account administrative procedure
The user root special user something called anything system
This high degree power necessary fully administer UNIX system also allows user make mistake cause system problem
Unprivileged user usually On system privilege delegated varying degree
These delegation defined using
The following abbreviated list default assignment Windows defines number administrative privilege assigned individually user group
An account user hold privilege granted either directly indirectly group membership
Upon installation number group account created privilege granted
However grant changed later time though
Unlike Linux privilege implicitly permanently granted specific account
Some administrative privilege
taking ownership restoring arbitrary file powerful used malicious intent could allow entire system compromised
With default since Windows Vista Windows strip user token privilege login
Thus user log account broad system privilege still system privilege
Whenever user want perform administrative action requiring system privilege process
When launching process user made aware administrative privilege asserted prompt requiring consent
Not holding privilege actually required keeping
Elevated process run full privilege full privilege
Even privilege user may still required particular process thus completely
The Windows ME Windows Windows previous version Windows operated FAT filesystem support filesystem therefore privilege effectively defeated Windows system use file system
The name used Windows source code end either Privilege LogonRight
This led confusion full set Rights Privileges called
Microsoft currently us term User Rights
In past term also used Microsoft Privilege Rights logon user right

About site A journal thought thing life Collection article I published Presentations I delivered recently Software I written My link collection My picture collection featuring cute little chihuahua Pico Quick introduction internals people scared word like
In simplified form git object storage DAG object handful different type object
They stored compressed identified hash incidentally content file represent representation git
The simplest object bunch byte
This often file symlink pretty much anything else
The object point determines semantics
Directories represented object
They refer content file filename access mode etc stored subdirectory
When node point another node DAG node exist without
Nodes nothing point garbage collected rescued much like filesystem inodes filename pointing
A refers represents state file time commit
It also refers parent
More one parent mean commit merge parent mean initial commit interestingly one initial commit usually mean two separate project merged
The body object commit message
References head branch like note slapped node DAG
Where DAG get added existing node mutated moved around freely
They get stored history directly transferred repository
They act sort bookmark I working
add node DAG move note current branch new node
The ref special actually point another ref
It pointer currently active branch
Normal ref actually namespace often skip part
Remote reference note different color
The difference normal different namespace fact remote ref essentially controlled remote server
update
A node DAG note yet another color
A point includes optional message GPG signature
The fast way access tag lost recovered DAG
The node DAG moved repository repository stored effective form pack unused node garbage collected
But end repository always DAG
So armed knowledge store version history visualize thing like merges differ tool try manage history linear change per branch
This simplest repository
We remote repository one commit
Here ed remote received one new commit remote merged yet
The situation
As merge new commits local branch thing happened moving note changing file working directory respectively
One local later
We new local commit new remote commit
Clearly merge needed
Results
Because new local commits actual new node created DAG
Note two parent Here tree look commits branch another merge
See stitching pattern emerge
The DAG record exactly history action taken
The stitching pattern somewhat tedious read
If yet published branch clearly communicated others base work alternative
You branch instead merging commit replaced another commit different parent branch moved
Your old commit remain DAG garbage collected
Ignore know way screwed totally
If extra pointing old commit remain pointing keep old commit alive indefinitely
That fairly confusing though
Do rebase branch others created new commits top
It possible recover hard extra work needed frustrating
The situation garbage collecting ignoring unreachable commit creating new commit top branch
also know rebase multiple commits one command
That end brief intro people intimidated computer science
Hope helped

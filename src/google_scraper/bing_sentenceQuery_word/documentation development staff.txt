There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
The name overall process developing start finish
When starting new software project important plan developed maintained
There different theory develop test software
The process known cycle even piece software finished might necessary go back beginning
For example might possible update software based new piece technology become available
You might able make big change software work continue development cycle
The following key stage cycle There three typical type maintenance You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
Steve Furber describes team get together draw plan software white board get coding Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

written text illustration accompanies embedded source code
It either explains operates use may mean different thing people different role
important part
Types documentation include documentation description particular shall
It used throughout communicate software function intended operate
It also used agreement foundation agreement software
Requirements produced consumed everyone involved production software name
Thus requirement documentation many different purpose
Requirements come variety style notation formality
Requirements close design anything
They specified statement drawn figure detailed combination
The variation complexity requirement documentation make proven challenge
Requirements may implicit hard uncover
It difficult know exactly much kind documentation needed much left architecture design documentation difficult know document requirement considering variety people shall read use documentation
Thus requirement documentation often incomplete
Without proper requirement documentation software change become difficult therefore error prone decreased expensive
The need requirement documentation typically related complexity product impact product software
If software complex developed many people mobile phone software requirement help better communicate achieve
If software negative impact human life nuclear power system medical equipment mechanical equipment formal requirement documentation often required
If software expected live month two small mobile phone application developed specifically certain campaign little requirement documentation may needed
If software first release later built upon requirement documentation helpful managing change software verifying nothing broken software modified
Traditionally requirement specified requirement document
using word processing application spreadsheet application
To manage increased complexity changing nature requirement documentation software documentation general system tool advocated
Architecture documentation also known special breed design document
In way architecture document third derivative code second derivative code document first
Very little architecture document specific code
These document describe program particular routine even particular routine exists form instead merely lay general requirement would motivate existence routine
A good architecture document short detail thick explanation
It may suggest approach lower level design leave actual exploration trade study document
Another breed design doc comparison document trade study
This would often take form
It focus one specific aspect system suggests alternate approach
It could code design even architectural level
It outline situation describe one alternative enumerate pro con
A good trade study document heavy research express idea clearly without relying heavily obtuse dazzle reader importantly impartial
It honestly clearly explain cost whatever solution offer best
The objective trade study devise best solution rather push particular point view
It perfectly acceptable state conclusion conclude none alternative sufficiently better baseline warrant change
It approached scientific endeavor marketing technique
A important part design document enterprise software development Database Design Document DDD
It contains Conceptual Logical Physical Design Elements
The DDD includes formal information people interact database need
The purpose preparing create common source used player within scene
The potential user When talking Systems document include following part It important include information used actor scene
It also important update document change occurs database well
It important code document associated source code may include file documentation thorough verbose becomes overly difficult maintain
Various overview documentation guide commonly found specific software application software product documented
This documentation may used developer tester also using software application
Today lot application field power energy transportation network aerospace safety security industry automation variety domain seen
Technical documentation become important within organization basic advanced level information may change period time architecture change
Code document often organized style allowing programmer quickly look arbitrary function class
Often Universal Report used code extract comment available source code create reference manual form text file
The idea documentation attractive programmer various reason
For example extracted source code example programmer write referring code use tool used create source code make documentation
This make much easier keep documentation
Of course downside programmer edit kind documentation depends refresh output example running update document nightly
Some would characterize pro rather con
Respected computer scientist noted documentation difficult afterthought process advocated written time location extracted automatic mean
The programming language support simple form literate programming support widely used
Elucidative Programming result practical application Literate Programming real programming context
The Elucidative paradigm proposes source code documentation stored separately
Often software developer need able create access information going part source file
Such usually part several software development activity code walk porting third party source code analysed functional way
Annotations therefore help developer stage software development formal documentation system would hinder progress
Unlike code document user document simply describe program used
In case code document user document could case effectively equivalent worth conjoining general application often true
Typically user documentation describes feature program assist user realizing feature
A good user document also go far provide thorough assistance
It important user document confusing date
User document need organized particular way important thorough
Consistency simplicity also valuable
User documentation considered constitute contract specifying software
well accomplished towards writing good user document would well aware software architecture programming technique used
See also
User documentation produced variety online print format
However three broad way user documentation organized
A common complaint among user regarding software documentation one three approach taken two
It common limit provided software documentation give reference information command menu item
The job tutoring new user helping experienced user get program left private publisher often given significant assistance software developer
Like form technical documentation good user documentation benefit organized process development
In case user documentation process commonly occurs industry consists five step basic research phase process
actual documentation phase
phase feedback sought draft composed previous step
whereby usability document tested empirically
final step information collected step three four used produce final draft
The resistance documentation among developer well known need emphasis
This situation particularly prevalent methodology try avoid unnecessary activity directly bring value
Specifically advocate valuing working software comprehensive documentation could interpreted cynically We want spend time coding
Remember real programmer write documentation
A survey among software engineering expert revealed however documentation mean considered unnecessary agile development
Yet acknowledged motivational problem development documentation method tailored agile development
may needed
For many application necessary promotional material encourage casual observer spend time learning product
This form documentation three purpose

By Let honest
No one want write read actually
I talking documentation usually defined step Project Life Cycle
Although documentation occur point I focusing tip documentation phase
Please note two subset documentation I discussing
While research article I pulled editor Anthony Ralston Chester Meek
It definitely first edition classic thing timeless
It state Documentation listing Your opinion documentation phase Project Life Cycle likely depends role IT organization
If manager project lead documentation critical success project
If position documentation annoying nuisance get way work
While tip mainly targeted toward latter category manager supervisor also benefit
The old adage picture worth thousand word mean using picture augment text minimize length complexity documentation
System user like picture diagram table bulleted list quick reference
Examples excellent way end user quickly grasp concept may fully understand
It also good way end user learning new software sit tackle new challenge easily
Here example documentation picture term Microsoft us saving shadow copy file
If working document project labor intensive accidentally lost part work go back previous version
Think automated way make snapshot file looked previous point time
But first configure Vista Previous Versions Figures B E turned scroll bar scroll logical find one want enable Previous Versions
That logical drive name Documents example
check box next logical drive name
Apply OK close System Properties window
File Close red X box part Control Panel System window close
To restore previous version file filename Explorer Restore previous version
Even know targeted user base documentation need written anyone basic computer skill read learn properly use system
instruction provided possible consider placing appendix separate chapter making available via hyperlink avoid clutter
If documentation change mindset place shoe new system user
That difficult first pay attention detail fully document feature function create documentation assume user figure information procedure failed include
Do assume end user understands acronym litter IT landscape
The first time present new acronym detail acronym stand
When testing system tried best break software way could
If software known issue developer like call issue end user call bug document workaround provide user help desk
You save lot frustration end user also lot extra call help desk
Document event inevitable lifetime system Your documentation anticipate problem provide detailed plan instruction system recovery
Will person replaces know find documentation purchased vendor application documentation
All document neatly organized stored together safe known place
Another good example anticipating problem Millennium Bug problem solution
The medium began reporting late system software likely fail due storage two digit year legacy system
This problem anticipated advance lot effort went fixing problem occurred
Software development built certified compliant year advance January
The result remarkably successful
Except minor reported problem New Year Day festive occasion disaster IT community though lot u
The mindset used anticipate problem might arise documentation
The problem also illustrates need continual document updating
Documentation changed note compliance noncompliance software system
For older legacy system workarounds found documented
Sit follow instruction
If documenting building server network IT system start clean partition build everything scratch
You undoubtedly discover left something instruction unclear
Work uninformed committed get feedback publish
Let test documentation
You amazed learn sit person work software documentation first time
A lot feature software obvious obvious someone honest willing work
Watch closely navigating software
Ask feedback take note
I remember feedback I got testing one project
The feedback written I could review point point
The first thought came mind long take
You may also take comment critical personal
Do make mistake
Looking back I implemented missing feature helpful critic provided
Use opportunity make final tweak project
Feedback documentation process help make overall project successful
I writing review Foxconn motherboard I ran across two error manual
I first person review board
Foxconn missed error reviewer missed error well
One mistake manual far trivial
The diagram manual showing normal position clear CMOS jumper setting incorrect
I know turning motherboard verify proper seating heatsink jumper fell
I put jumper back according instruction manual
The computer failed POST
After careful look tiny diagram motherboard I discovered error corrected misplaced jumper
I working tech Foxconn time kind enough answer question I informed error
Documentation error like easy miss lead potentially large cost manufacturer
I would missed error fact jumper loose enough fall turning motherboard
How many time read user manual wondered really human end creation manual computer made manual
Although want create colorful novel humanize document enough personality reader feel little comfortable reading
Documentation costly even done correctly
New technology continue created help create effective documentation le costly develop
Look new tool opportunity reduce time cost documentation process
Documenting part project team especially difficult
Your documentation need shared added documentation team member
Changes made often daily basis
Software exists allow help ensure standardized end product also help foster sharing idea knowledge among team member
While working CSC Computer Sciences Corporation I experimented Microsoft Agent technology mixed result
I always thought offered wonderful way guide new user feature system
Some may remember offensive little paper clip character blinking eye Word
It slightly annoying
With Agent character move across screen point box programmatically open box allow character speak option presented
I created guided tour software let Peedy parrot point box fill text box change screen generally walk end user entire process creating new record database
I found using Agent saved write many tedious page documentation detailed step necessary create save modify new record
It also fun develop
It allowed creative side participate positive beneficial way
Creativity developer key component make successful
Creativity considered developing documentation depending standard expectation company
The feedback I received MS Agent experiment never taken seriously least part comical looking character
It lot extra work build require learn new coding technique
It pleasure person department trained
I told take guided tour
Perhaps Microsoft ahead time respectable character type technology could still become mainstream one day
I recently built computer dad wedding anniversary gift
I documented note marked left shortcut desktop
I also created audio file documented feature use computer
I ask looked note offered tell took case computer audio tour
These example alternative way document
It humble writer opinion new way document underutilized underestimated simplicity potential impact today corporate environment
The elusive end documentation software package yet developed designed specific documentation task
The best person document builder
After know system better system builder
If system builder likely crack programmer
But mention word programmer given got kidding look
If forced programmer document work least make attempt create something pas documentation
I know
I seen often even guilty
And real shame programmer good documentation skill valuable asset company
What manager remember performance review time another person documentation project
My guess wo deserve promotion raise bonus
While exactly fun documentation rewarding done correctly
Not better overall project present customer also greatly reduce future support time provide
You also reduce amount support maintenance time help desk
When working CSC I given opportunity project lead design creation global reporting system infrastructure
I got see first hand side documentation
We good programmer group Crystal Reports API work custom function building
It obvious knowledge unique needed shared rest team better way properly document work
I entirely successful getting explain work point another person could step pick
He list explain function name use worked accomplished helpful member team
There seems unwritten rule Realm Code programming skill inversely proportional amount documentation programmer
The second greatest compliment ever paid career I give presentation global technical support team
I create present documentation build reporting server
One database administrator chap England sit presentation
He looked document paraphrase commented good documentation able build reporting server using documentation
Statements like make hard work worth
And compliment main project work documentation
You cut documentation time build User Documentation time write System Documentation
You share information two reduce missing information
Even want inappropriate share information document benefit topic one document prompt include additional documentation
Create follow standard format guideline
This help ensure important information excluded allow easier reading system user
The one time I dedicated documentation expert work document system Hughes Aircraft Company
The result excellent
The format department standard result better I would done
It required lot time effort get result
The documentation expert needed access beta system access I could answer question
This expensive company resource allocate professional documentation result excellent system builder verify important information misinterpreted left end product
I fortunate I former engineer also excellent writing documentation
He understood system designed built filled blank actually using system discovering worked
You may fortunate
In day age global marketing sale support documentation also follow country regional standard
I often irritated reading manual piece electronic gear made China often difficult translate
It written Chinglish sentence I pause try comprehend
I usually make mental Scooby Doo sound move rest manual
Were documentation pro learn never write Chinese I imagine Englese would sound people
Find use professional translator make documentation understandable important information lost translation
I also state obvious
Your documentation free misspelling grammatical error
Always use find error
I never cease amazed many obvious spelling error I made simply missed reread
If I already convinced creating good documentation good employer take comfort fact creating good documentation menial task
When document work also documentation
Hopefully tip help avoid disruptive question bound come way friendly help desk tech
This first officially published document
I want personally thank Sonja Thompson Mark Kaelin giving opportunity share thought

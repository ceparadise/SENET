In either following In programming language basic data type
In addition many language also provide set composite data type
Opinions vary whether type composite considered primitive
Depending language implementation primitive data type may may correspondence object computer memory
However one usually expects operation basic primitive data type fastest language construct
Integer addition example performed single machine instruction offer specific instruction process sequence character single instruction
In particular standard mention int object natural size suggested architecture execution environment
This mean likely bit long architecture
Basic primitive type almost always
Most language allow behavior capability primitive either basic data type modified program
Exceptions include permit data type extended within program adding operation performed even redefining operation
The actual range primitive data type available dependent upon specific programming language used
For example composite data type whereas modern dialect assimilated primitive data type basic
Classic basic primitive type may include More sophisticated type include An data type represents
Integers may either signed allowing negative value unsigned
Common range Literals integer written regular numeral consisting sequence digit negation indicated value
However programming language disallow use comma
Examples integer literal There several alternate method writing integer literal many programming language A type typically denoted bool boolean typically either true false
Although one bit necessary accommodate value set true false programming language typically implement boolean type one byte
Many language
implement booleans adhering concept distinct logical type
Languages though may implicitly convert booleans time give extended semantics booleans boolean expression achieve backwards compatibility earlier version language
For example former standard dedicated boolean type
Instead numeric value zero interpreted false value interpreted true
add distinct boolean type included support type true false reserved word
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally format equivalent typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
Many language often called float type
Literals floating point number include decimal point typically use denote scientific notation
Examples literal Some language also type comprising two number real part imaginary part
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally form typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
number also tend limited range value programmer must careful avoid overflow intermediate calculation well final result
A type typically called char may contain single specialized code
In defined smallest addressable unit memory
On system Several standard require size
Some language two character type example type character type character
The term character type normally used even type whose value precisely represent example code unit
Characters may combined
The string data include number numerical symbol treated text
Strings implemented various way depending programming language
The simplest way implement string create array character followed delimiting character used signal end string usually
These referred usually found language low amount
While easy implement null terminated string criticized causing
Most scripting language many dialect separate character type string length one normally used represent single character
Some language capability use string usually measure additionally provide class string handling respectively standard library
There also difference whether string mutable language
Mutable string may altered creation whereas immutable string maintain constant size content
In latter way alter string create new one
There advantage disadvantage approach although immutable string much le flexible simpler completely
Some example language use mutable string include whereas language include
A language provide different type mutable immutable string
Literals character string usually surrounded sometimes single quote used character double quote used string
Examples character literal C syntax Examples string literal C syntax Each numeric data type maximum minimum value known
Attempting store number outside range may lead error incorrect calculation due depending language used
The range variable based number byte used save value integer data type usually able store value number contribute value
For data type
value range complicated vary depending method used store
There also type use entire byte
boolean requires single represents value although practice byte often used remaining bit redundant
Some programming language also allow opposite direction programmer defines range precision needed solve given problem compiler chooses appropriate integer type automatically

Hey I taking course computability theory I struggling primitive recursion
More specifically often asked prove arbitrary function primitive recursive I really know go
For example Let x number prime x
Show x primitive recursive
How go proving formally
And general necessary condition prove something primitive recursive
Note homework I pulled question list example given This exact answer help quickly determine many case given function primitive recursive
The idea use reasonable programming language function expressed easily raw arithmetic primitive recursion
Of course programming language must limited enough prevent unbounded search construct lead general recursion
I mention one easy possibility
Suppose function f N N computed simple imperative program polynomial running time actually Grigory point answer primitive recursive bound
More precisely program allowed use basic arithmetic operation boolean value variable array loop conditional statement
Then function f primitive recursive
The reason program define primitive recursive function entire execution program may encoded number N whose bit size bounded polynomial p n n input
Because verifying number encodes execution simple imperative program primitive recursive perform bounded search p n find number N bounded search primitive recursive extract answer
Let u apply question
The following Python program computes function n us couple loop basic arithmetic could replace remainder function another loop
Its running time quadratic n assuming basic operation constant time Therefore function primitive recursive
A conceptually simple test whether function primitive recursive whether write
The crucial point loop control flow structure force say advance many time loop
example code working prime written Bloop
Show function f x case x prime otherwise case primitive recursive
Then show given primitive recursive function f N function g N g x also primitive recursive
Then adapt prove want
In general prove specific function primitive recursive depends function
I love hear sufficient condition general nature though
There hand various necessary condition function primitive recursive used show specific function primitive recursive
This one show example Ackermann function primitive recursive one show grows fast
There theorem say function computable Turing machine time primitive recursive function length input primitively recursive
This theorem find Your function primitively recursive computed O time n length input computer using programming language like
The difference time needed implement algorithm Turing machine polynomial length input resulting time needed implementation Turing machine polynomial n
edit Proving function primitive recursive harder
There proof diagonalization method show exists primitively recursive function
To construct explicit function noted function grows fast primitively recursive
Ackerman function right growth rate
There theorem say function computable Turing machine time primitive recursive function length input primitively recursive
This mentioned result really powerful theorem numerous application
It easily yield result like one
Assume g h p prim rec
Then f prim rec f x x x time f x f x f x p x f
Trying figure direct solution le impossible
So recommendation If course value recursion simultaneous recursion work try theorem

Quick Overview Day Give detail variable
Reinforce idea data type
Practice Python problem simple
Remember learned four primitive data type overview Python
They Note Your teacher may choose use following example class activity displaying example take guess think running code
For following example consider data type variable
What program output
Why
There two way use Thonny
In shell mode type Python expression interpreter immediately show result
The example show Python shell work
The called
The interpreter us prompt indicate ready instruction
We typed pressed Enter
The interpreter evaluated expression replied
On next line gave new prompt indicating ready input
Working directly interpreter convenient testing short bit code get immediate feedback
Think scratch paper used help work problem
Alternatively write entire program placing line Python instruction file use interpreter execute content file whole
Such file often referred
For example used Thonny create source code file named following content By convention file contain Python program name end
Thonny save file extension automatically able open Thonny double clicking File Explorer Finder
Note Notice using worry using see value statement
The shell automatically
However using need call time want see output
As program get bigger complicated get difficult read
Formal language
programming language dense often difficult look piece code figure
For reason good idea add note program explain natural language program
These note called comment
A computer program text intended human reader completely ignored interpreter
In Python token start comment
The rest line ignored
could look something like Note Create folder call Computer Science computer hold code write Python semester
Save file created save folder
Notice run program print phrase Hello World
None comment appear
You also notice left blank line program
Blank line also ignored interpreter comment blank line make program much easier human parse
Use liberally
One powerful feature programming language ability manipulate
A variable name refers value
create new variable also give value refer
This example make three assignment
The first assigns string value new variable named
The second give integer third assigns number variable called
The confused see later equality us token
The assignment statement link left hand side operator right hand side
This get error enter Tip When reading writing code say n assigned n get value n reference object n refers object
Don say n equal
A common way represent variable paper write name arrow pointing variable value
This kind figure known often called show state variable particular instant time
Think variable state mind
This diagram show result executing assignment statement shown
If ask Python evaluate variable produce value currently linked variable
In word evaluating variable give value referred variable
In case result value variable
Variables also type ask interpreter
The type variable type object currently refers
We use variable program remember thing like current score basketball game
But variable
This mean change time like scoreboard basketball game
You assign value variable later assign different value variable
Note This different math
In math give value change refer different value calculation
To see read run following program
You notice change value three time third assignment even give value different type
What printed following statement execute
arbitrarily long
They contain letter digit begin letter underscore
You use long descriptive variable name
For example creating program calculate much gas car us good variable name might
A bad variable name case would
Using single letter variable name usually make program harder understand people
Although bit annoying type long variable name first time typed Thonny able simply type first letter variable name press rest variable name
The underscore character also appear name
It often used name multiple word
Caution Variable name never contain space
There situation name beginning underscore special meaning safe rule beginner start name letter
Although legal use uppercase letter convention
If choose use uppercase letter remember case matter
different variable
If give variable illegal name get syntax error
In example variable name illegal
illegal begin letter
illegal contains illegal character dollar sign
But wrong
It turn one Python
Keywords define language syntax rule structure used variable name
Python keywords every improvement Python introduce eliminate one two You might want keep list handy
If interpreter complains one variable name know see list
Programmers generally choose name variable meaningful human reader program help programmer document remember variable used
If want user type something use function

You need convert int float expecting number
The following example going work try run
Can figure wrong fix
sample solution unless spent time attempting create solution
This one possible solution Try following practice problem
Be sure know question attempt write solution Python
You either work directly textbook using Thonny
Either way finished code Thonny save solution Computer Science folder finish
Note Remember every time take user data type input string
You might want look back
Write program compute area circle
Prompt user enter radius print nice message back user answer
sample solution unless already finished creating solution
This one possible solution Write program compute area rectangle
Prompt user enter width height rectangle
Print nice message answer
sample solution unless already finished creating solution
This one possible solution Write program compute Litres per Kilometers car us
Promp user enter number kilometer driven number litre used
Print nice message answer

sample solution unless already finished creating solution
This one possible solution If completed question end class might want try one following extra challenge Created Dan Schellenberg

In computing
It consists visual area containing program belongs framed
It usually rectangular shape overlap area window
It display may allow one
Windows primarily associated graphical display manipulated employing kind
display also support windowing way maintain multiple independent display area multiple buffer
Text window usually controlled keyboard though also respond mouse
A GUI using window one main called whose main component
The idea developed led
Their earliest system supported multiple window obvious way indicate boundary window border etc
Research continued Corporation Research Center led
They used overlapping window
During term stand window icon menu pointer coined PARC
worked PARC briefly time
Apple developed interface based PARC interface
It first used later computer
developing office application Mac time
Some speculate gave access Apple OS released thus influenced design windowing system would eventually called
Windows two dimensional object arranged plane called
In modern windowing system resized moved hidden restored closed commonly represented X button thanks big influence future OSs
Windows usually include graphical object possibly including toolbars control icon often working area
In working area document image folder content main object displayed
Around working area within bounding window may smaller window area sometimes called pane panel showing relevant information option
The working area hold one main object
Child window example many web browser make several similar document main object available within single main application window
Some window feature called drawer pane slide side window show extra option
Applications run either may use different terminology
us term refer area within display traditional window controlled called
Any window split window content although system purposely eschew window decoration form

Computer science also strong connection discipline
Many problem science engineering health care business area solved effectively computer finding solution requires computer science expertise knowledge particular application domain
Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun
Not mention lucrative career opportunity
Computer Science The Profession Computer science discipline involves understanding design computer computational process
In general form concerned understanding information transfer transformation
Particular interest placed making process efficient endowing form intelligence
The discipline range theoretical study algorithm practical problem implementation term computational hardware software
A central focus process handling manipulating information
Thus discipline span advancing fundamental understanding algorithm information process general well practical design efficient reliable software hardware meet given specification
Computer science young discipline evolving rapidly beginning
As includes theoretical study experimental method engineering design one discipline
This differs radically physical science separate understanding advancement science application science field engineering design implementation
In computer science inherent intermingling theoretical concept computability algorithmic efficiency modern practical advancement electronics continue stimulate advance discipline
It close interaction theoretical design aspect field bind together single discipline
Because rapid evolution difficult provide complete list computer science area
Yet clear crucial area theory algorithm data structure programming methodology language computer element architecture
Other area include software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation
A professional computer scientist must firm foundation crucial area field likely knowledge one area discipline depending upon person particular area practice
Thus well educated computer scientist able apply fundamental concept technique computation algorithm computer design specific design problem
The work includes detailing specification analysis problem provides design function desired satisfactory performance reliable maintainable meet desired cost criterion
Clearly computer scientist must sufficient training computer science area able accomplish task must also firm understanding area mathematics science well broad education liberal study provide basis understanding societal implication work performed
Computer Science study principle application technology computing computer
It involves study data data structure algorithm process structure principle computer hardware software design methodology topic numerical analysis operation research artificial intelligence language design structure translation technique
Computer Science provides foundation knowledge student career objective wide range computing profession

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
There lot word male female form usually alternate suffix word indicate gender example waiter waitress mister mistress etc
The one always puzzled though widow widower
Following form previous example I understand widower men form word suffix woman
Why woman called widowess
I suspect phrase needed woman much later literary invention
Widow lot legal implication property title
If survivor marriage woman thing got complicated woman many right
If survivor man middle age really make much difference held property anyway
A similar question came illegitimate girl child word legal need consider
For rest English generally many gender anymore survived necessary know actual sex
So example actress rather euphemism role like modern actress whatever knowing sex relatively important
The term widower obviously extension widow extended widow Widow old enough credited Middle English widewe Old English widuwe
My guess term starting woman economical independence men granted throughout history
The strength rarer polyandry also implies death wife would altered man married state due one
The need male counterpart great
Of note I rarely heard widow refer man lost spouse seems ridiculously uncommon thus potential error definition I saw specifically referred woman
The shift back gender neutral language may effect
Also widowed correct gender opposed widowered
Old English equal footing masculine widowa feminine widowe converge Early Modern English used gender author century
first occurs century way disambiguating
Historically men would die spouse involvement war many men predeceased wife hence term widow applied woman whose husband died
The term widower would used later life need arose distinguish man woman whose spouse died
Widow essentially translates empty house one webster bible opinion
This needing definition I would posit reference fact woman standing far owning anything could vote could buy sell property could convey property directly another person almost considered Chattel
So without whole lot research would speaking couple thing one would Husband lost wife would expected handle matter wife would standing well essentially thereby performing duty widow could say considered widower thought make sense

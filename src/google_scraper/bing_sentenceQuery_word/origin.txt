IBM role birth computer science began awkward meeting two starkly different individual
One IBM Chief Executive Thomas Watson son farmer lumber dealer grew near remote Painted Post NY graduated high school
The Benjamin Wood professor Columbia University head university Bureau Collegiate Educational Research
Yet Watson granted Wood noon meeting New York Century Club one day Wood quickly perceived Watson respected quest knowledge might respond favorably request tabulating machine could replace laborious method grading testing program
Wood explained Watson IBM machine could used measure anything represented mathematics including business activity physic biology astronomy scientific discipline
For Watson came revelation
Working university IBM involvement computer science
In General Electric suggested IBM run customer executive training class explain IBM product could client
In response IBM created tabulating program
Watson Laboratory course listed Columbia University course catalog
In IBM began teaching Watson Laboratory Course Computing seen first computer course
It reached people
The course dispersed IBM education center worldwide
By IBM educational center conducting million teaching
Following dot com crash number student enrolling computer science program declined
However trend reversing according new data annual Computing Research Association CRA Taulbee Survey
Total enrollment among US computer science undergraduate increased percent third straight year increase indicating decline
The survey document trend student enrollment employment graduate aspect computer science United States Canada
Careful time Watson earlier arranged assistant interrupt meeting end one hour
Instead shooed away assistant two men talked Watson hooked
In end donated machine Wood asked eventually became Columbia trustee
Ultimately close relationship IBM university instrumental emergence new scientific discipline Columbia offering one first course computing
They helped catalyze teaching computer science say Henry Chesbrough executive director Program Open Innovation Haas School Business University California Berkeley

The first computer science department American college came along early starting Purdue University
Frederick Brooks IBM executive love teaching one pioneer field
Brooks managed development mainframe operating system volunteer teacher Columbia IBM Systems Research Institute accepted job setting computer science department University North Carolina Chapel Hill
The popularity computer science academic major waxed waned year
Enrollments United States dropped significantly analyst predicted many computer science programming job would migrate India
But since financial crisis computer science popularity
The excitement day interdisciplinary program combining computer science biology medicine business
The discipline still young enough
Changes happening say Brooks remains professor UNC
IBM remains confluence computing academia
Since advocating new field interdisciplinary study blend computing business social service science

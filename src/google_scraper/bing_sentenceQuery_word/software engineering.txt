Here quick overview three computing major department offer
I teach primarily software engineering course may bit biased
cover core concept technology involved make computer something
Learning program computer writing software essential computer programming used computer science course
You learn detail computer network work emphasis software programming language work
You learn make sophisticated thing
graphic robotics database operating system
You also learn theory behind computer software work
In senior project tackle problem frontier computer science
You may building new system discovering better way design software developing new algorithm project entirely different field
Past student project include video game computer modeling animation tool Linux driver Wii remote
teach design system include computer hardware software
You take class computer hardware work build computer
You take software class emphasis software device driver operating system
Computer engineering course taught faculty computer science electrical engineering department
Working computer engineer design computer basic software run including personal computer embedded computer system run car aircraft videogames etc
focus design build software team
You take many course would computer science take additional course teach topic like requirement engineering software architecture software testing software deployment
You learn working people communication management working customer process developing software measure analyze software product software process
The software engineering major requires take three course long sequence called software engineering capstone
The capstone course centered around large project outside customer

For another take difference computing degree see particularly
Or see

There significant overlap software engineering computer science degree program
Professionals two field often compete position
There distinction education however future may distinction role allowed perform
focusing subject crucial understanding emerging system
program
Software engineering engineering discipline
A licensing examination development stakeholder believe within two year number state licensing software developer whose work impact safety public welfare
Moreover many people field believe software development approached engineering discipline even direct bearing public safety
In Steve McConnell argues software development follow principle engineering
Scientists research extend scientific knowledge test theory work edge unknown
Engineers start knowledge already proven reliable
Their job create design work
Engineers need breadth broad scope education scientist need depth narrow branch knowledge
McConnell suggests better degree computer science work software development without related degree
Still traditional computer science degree focus theoretical aspect profession always provide best education
Realize term software engineering sometimes
Some company choose use title software engineer even particular position require engineering
Also program titled software engineering accredited Accreditation Board Engineering Technology ABET
For reason confusion among future software developer distinction program
Some school offer separate track computer science software engineering
The two track generally include common course different overall architecture
Both computer science software engineering program accredited ABET
Computer science fall banner Computing Accreditation Commission though computer engineering responsibility Engineering Accreditation Commission
There significant difference requirement
Software engineering program include design project project future software engineer display ability apply engineering principle real world
The senior project may applicable software engineer future work
Students graduate computer science software engineering program cite variety difference
Courses computer science often place greater emphasis theoretical
They emphasize algorithm
Traditionally considered good preparation graduate level research
According BLS also prove useful system software engineering
Some graduate report computer science course include mathematics
This always case however
At Auburn University Calculus III listed requirement software engineering degree school year computer science one
Both program include computer elective allow candidate tailor program meet individual goal
The line two track blurred bit computer science program borrowed newer software engineering field
You may well find engineering course computer science curriculum
If envision working field like embedded software likely want engineering degree sort
If intending work arena may allow interest belief well program reputation dictate choice
Do share McDonnell belief developer engineer

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering

That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

The origin term software engineering attributed different source
The term software engineering used August issue Communications ACM Volume number letter ACM membership ACM President Anthony Oettinger
More commonly traced title seminal NATO conference Professor
Bauer first conference software engineering
The conference attended international expert software agreed defining best practice software grounded application engineering
The result conference report defines software developed
The original report publicly available
The field also give credit many work development spread
The discipline software engineering created address poor quality software get project exceeding time budget control ensure software built systematically rigorously measurably time budget within specification
Engineering already address issue hence principle used engineering applied software
The widespread lack best practice software time perceived
documented several key advance field book Engineering Economics
These include Constructive Cost Model relates software development effort program T SLOC
The book analyzes software project concludes cost fixing error escalates project move toward field use
The book also asserts key driver software cost capability software development team

Injuries occupation rare
However like worker spend long period front computer terminal typing keyboard engineer programmer susceptible eyestrain back discomfort hand wrist problem
The field future look bright according rated Software Engineer best job United States
In software engineering ranked best job United States time
The offer certification specific topic like process improvement
company also sponsor certification examination
Many program oriented toward specific technology managed vendor technology
These certification program tailored institution would employ people use technology
Broader certification general software engineering skill available various professional society
As certified software professional CSDP
In added certification known Certified Software Development Associate CSDA
The professional certification program early discontinued due lack interest
The ACM examined possibility professional certification software engineer late eventually decided certification inappropriate professional industrial practice software engineering
In developed legally recognized professional certification called available fully qualified member
Software engineer may eligible membership qualify Chartered Engineer status
In Canada developed legally recognized professional certification called
In Ontario Canada Software Engineers graduate accredited program successfully complete PEO Professional Practice Examination PPE least month acceptable engineering experience eligible licensed become Professional Engineers
The PEO recognize online distance education however consider Computer Science program equivalent software engineering program despite tremendous overlap two
This sparked controversy certification war
It also held number holder profession exceptionally low
The vast majority working professional field hold degree CS SE
Given difficult certification path holder degree never bother pursue license
The initial impact outsourcing relatively lower cost international human resource developing third world country led massive migration software development activity corporation North America Europe India later China Russia developing country
This approach flaw mainly distance timezone difference prevented human interaction client developer massive job transfer
This negative impact many aspect software engineering profession
For example student avoid education related software engineering fear importing software product service country displaced
Although statistic currently show threat software engineering related career appear affected
Nevertheless ability smartly leverage offshore resource via workflow improved overall operational capability many organization
When North Americans leaving work Asians arriving work
When Asians leaving work Europeans arriving work
This provides continuous ability human oversight process hour per day without paying overtime compensation disrupting key human resource sleep pattern
While global outsourcing several advantage global generally distributed development run serious difficulty resulting distance developer
This due key element type distance identified geographical temporal cultural communication includes use different language dialect English different location
Research carried area global software development last year extensive body relevant work published highlight benefit problem associated complex activity
As aspect software engineering research ongoing related area
Software engineering direct overlap
It also considered part overall
In general software engineering focus technique application software development industry computer science focus algorithm theory
Typical formal definition The term used le formally Software engineering see practitioner individual follow engineering approach
These approach specified various software engineering book research paper always connotation predictability precision mitigated risk professionalism
This perspective led call licensing certification codified body knowledge mechanism spreading engineering knowledge maturing field
proposed body software developer alternative emphasizes coding skill accountability software developer without professionalism prescribed curriculum leading craftmanship without engineering lack predictability precision missing risk mitigation method informal poorly defined

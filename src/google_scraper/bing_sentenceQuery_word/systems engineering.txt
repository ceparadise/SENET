You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

If thinking career software design computing know difference computer science CS computer system engineering
A CS degree focus sequential programming software design computer system engineering degree divide focus evenly programming
A CS degree also cover basic programming software developer working knowledge Assembly language computer architecture design
programming people think talk software engineering
It best approach computer scientist come develop desktop mobile application organizes extremely complicated process relatively easy understand
However performance cost building software top multiple layer abstraction make code run slowly code need interpreted understood processor
Relatively programmer design software process completely different programming
In beginning computer science programming crazy mathematician university laboratory operated directly gut computer make answer question linear algebra statistic would take human entire lifetime solve
The computer instruction fed directly central processor written would look like sequence one zero
They told computer simple task like change zero one move one left certain number place combining simple instruction programmer could tell computer complicated thing like divide raise power
Because binary instruction looked like gibberish human prone error eventually computer scientist developed form programming called Assembly language
Programmers still think term simple instruction could write instruction meaningful word like add Today Assembly language still used write source code operating system long processor perform operation one time simple binary instruction fed operating system
Computer system engineer need know design hardware software solve problem industry engineering require computer
They usually work manufacturing logistics industrial setting design specialized computer automation product assembly
They need basic understanding programming design user interface application
CS subject software engineer major really pure science root mathematics
In word field engineering field research deal algorithm theory mathematics series sequence
Software engineering currently main focus innovation biggest potential development
Employment growth computer engineer programmer computer scientist
If interested engineering improve job outlook earning becoming familiar programming

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

In set stored storage location denoted word copy value variable
In assignment statement expression fundamental construct
Today commonly used notation basic operation come originally Superplan popularized followed originally popularised although many notation use
In language symbol used regarded meaning assignment value others define assignment statement meaning used expression
Assignments typically allow variable hold different value different time
However language primarily allow kind destructive reassignment might imply change state
The purpose enforce
function depend state variable produce result given set parametric input point time
Modern program language also often use similar strategy although le strict certain part order reduce complexity normally conjunction complementing methodology
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed purely functional language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent reassignment allowed
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available purely functional language variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include data structure var accepts multiple assignment value equal contrast Haskell dataflow variable cell data structure like list symbol vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate represented
This type one possible value therefore containing information
It typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
Certain use pattern common thus often special syntax support
These primarily reduce redundancy source code also simplify compilation clarifying programmer intent easing analysis source code
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant provide special operator called like instead written
Beyond syntactic sugar simplifies compilation since make clear modification variable possible
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
Chained assignment equivalent sequence assignment evaluation strategy differs language
For simple chained assignment like initializing multiple variable evaluation strategy matter target assignment connected way evaluation strategy affect result
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment expression value
In case chain assignment implemented assignment happen
For example equivalent
In also available value class type declaring appropriate return type assignment operator
In assignment statement expression thus value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
This essentially equivalent though actual variable produced temporary value
Some programming language since allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
This often known introduced name sometimes called though confusing used single assignment opposite
If side assignment single variable
array structure feature called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly swap value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Some language Go Python combine parallel assignment tuples automatic allow multiple return value single function Python example This provides alternative use returning multiple value function
This date CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally
In C similar parallel assignment allowing multiple assignment occur within single statement writing instead
This primarily used replaced parallel assignment language Go
However code ensure perfect simultaneity since right side following code evaluated left side
In language Python assign two variable concurrently using initial value compute new b
The use equal sign assignment operator frequently criticized due conflict equal comparison equality
This result confusion novice writing code confusion even experienced programmer reading code
The use equal assignment date back language designed particularly popularized Fortran A notorious example bad idea choice equal sign denote assignment
It go back Fortran blindly copied army language designer
Why bad idea
Because overthrow century old tradition let denote comparison equality predicate either true false
But Fortran made mean assignment enforcing equality
In case operand unequal footing The left operand variable made equal right operand expression
x mean thing x
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C including one famous attempt backdoor Linux kernel assignment operator also return value assigned way function return value validly nested inside expression
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
The two common representation copying assignment
Both form may semantically denote either assignment assignment also value depending language usage
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Mathematical assignment generally depicted
Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix postfix syntax statement including assignment

When designing program may instruction need repeating
This known iteration implemented programming using FOR WHILE statement
An plan set designed solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm Algorithms used help design perform particular task
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Algorithms consist step carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step The algorithm repeat step cereal milk eaten
This make designing algorithm quicker simpler include lot unnecessary step
Once algorithm designed perfected must translated code computer read
We create program algorithm
Algorithms consist step
Programs consist statement
A statement single instruction word single step
Iteration implemented programming using statement
In programming iteration often referred looping program iterates loop earlier step

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing

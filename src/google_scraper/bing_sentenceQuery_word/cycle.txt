This reduces cost maintanence
Periodic review performance review use data collection technique seen analysis section indicate whether improvement modification needed

In path edge vertex wherein reachable
There several different type cycle principally also element cycle space graph
A consists sequence starting ending vertex two consecutive vertex sequence adjacent graph
In directed graph edge must traversed walk consistently direction edge must oriented earlier two consecutive vertex later two vertex sequence
The choice starting vertex important traversing cyclic sequence edge different starting vertex produce closed walk
A may defined either closed walk repetition vertex edge allowed repetition starting ending vertex set edge walk
The two definition equivalent directed graph simple cycle also called cyclic sequence vertex edge walk completely determined set edge us
In undirected graph set edge cycle traversed walk either two direction giving two possible directed cycle every undirected cycle
For closed walk generally directed undirected graph multiset edge unambiguously determine vertex ordering
A closed walk allowing repetition vertex edge however also simple cycle explicit definition recommended used
In order maintain consistent terminology rest article cycle mean simple cycle except otherwise stated
A graph also called hole induced cycle cycle two vertex cycle connected edge belong cycle
An antihole graph hole
Chordless cycle may used characterize graph perfect none hole antiholes odd number vertex greater three
A special type perfect graph hole size greater three
The graph length shortest cycle cycle necessarily chordless
defined smallest regular graph given combination degree girth
A cycle graph property every two edge cycle connected path whose interior vertex avoid cycle
In graph formed adding one edge cycle peripheral cycle must induced cycle
The term may also refer element graph
There many cycle space one coefficient field ring
The common usually called simply consists edge set even degree every vertex form
By every element cycle space may formed union simple cycle
A graph set simple cycle form cycle space
Using idea binary cycle space generalizes vector space integer rational real number etc
The existence cycle directed undirected graph determined whether DFS find edge point ancestor current vertex contains
In undirected graph finding already visited vertex indicate back edge
All back edge DFS skip part cycle
In case undirected graph time required find cycle graph since edge tree edge
Many algorithm detect cycle since obstacle topological order exist
Also directed graph divided cycle exist within component since cycle strongly connected
For directed graph distributed cycle detection algorithm
Distributed cycle detection algorithm useful processing graph using distributed graph processing system supercomputer
Applications cycle detection include use detect concurrent system
In paper widely considered birth graph theory proved finite undirected graph closed walk visit edge exactly necessary sufficient connected except isolated vertex edge contained one component even degree vertex
The corresponding characterization existence closed walk visiting edge exactly directed graph graph equal number incoming outgoing edge vertex
In either case resulting walk known Euler tour
If finite undirected graph even degree vertex regardless whether connected possible find set simple cycle together cover edge exactly
When connected graph meet condition Euler theorem closed walk minimum length covering edge least nevertheless found solving
The problem finding single simple cycle cover vertex exactly rather covering edge much harder
Such cycle known determining whether exists
Much research published concerning class graph guaranteed contain Hamiltonian cycle one example Hamiltonian cycle always found graph every pair vertex degree summing least total number vertex graph
The state every exists simple cycle cover edge graph exactly twice
Proving true finding counterexample remains open problem
Several important class graph defined characterized cycle

What graph computer science used
In layman term preferably
I read definition In computer science graph abstract data type meant implement graph hypergraph concept mathematics
A graph data structure consists finite possibly mutable set ordered pair called edge arc certain entity called node vertex
As mathematics edge x said point go x
The node may part graph structure may external entity represented integer index reference
I looking le formal easier understand definition
A perfect layman example might
The network friend friend etc collectively refered
In graph considered graph
In Facebook bidirectional relationship A B Friend B A friend graph
A network like Twitter would considered since direction relationship meaning
All graph refered graph relationship node form cycle
A hand special kind graph among thing since cycle family tree relatioship
It technically called since directed acyclic This cover basic jargon involving graph able follow rest material field
Graphs one important mathematical concept used computer science
You seen graph many time
Imagine taking plane flight one city another
You inevitably find nice glossy magazine airline seat pocket front
Near back magazine almost always find map depicts city serviced airline represented circle flight connect city represented curved line
That graph
The city represented circle node graph flight represented curved line edge
Graphs thing node edge connect node
You embellish simple graph various way
You want see bunch circle line looking map
Those city name
Labeling city result labeled graph
You also label edge flight
Computer science often associate data node sometimes edge extension label
It still labeled graph
Another embellishment result fly directly city A city B city B city A
An obvious way portray put arrow line connects city depict relationship
Now directed graph
Linked list tree state transition diagram lot computer science data structure example graph
It powerful concept
A better question would What graph used
Computer Science many respect study Graphs
A graph layman term collection arbitrary abstract object called node vertex represent point connection
They connected via path edge
The abstract data type Graph implementation mathematical Graph
So basically node edge field various operation perform
You instance add new node graph collection could list array structure depending language
You could link node existing node
Operations would also include traversing graph checking whether two node share edge connected retrieving value node edge deletion node edge graph
As far utilization go Graphs used place
Networking make particularly heavy use found Artificial Intelligence Data Mining Game Development Geoinformatics host discipline
In formal Computer Science see even use namely way representing state
Effectively anything represent set connection represented graph implemented via ADT form
Here example graphic I made A graph collection object connected together line called vertex
The term graph abstraction generalization many data structure used software development
Linked list binary tree graph
Basically collection object pointer associate object graph
Once graph apply principle

A clock clock period rise fall time
The clock signal stay exact Boolean state state
The memory used design take clock cycle time compute write clock cycle compute read operation
What frequency clock
My attempt T f What duty cycle clock
My attempt D Could someone please kindly confirm whether I correctly
I retyped calculator multiple time seems case
The calculator sure right number enter unit right
Regarding frequency right part n Note last term read Hz GHz This hint usually applies physic basically every time deal unit wrong wrong
If asked frequency number time something occurs given time span come time span wrong
The thing applies second question divide time time get dimensionless number

I reading William Stallings Computer Organization Architecture understand control unit
Stallings explain interrupt cycle requires time unit complete Save current PC value MBR provides memory location value PC stored
It saved MAR
give address Interrupt Service Routine The MBR old value PC stored memory location whose address provided MAR But I thinking operation completed time unit
I checked twice I find dependency among performed time unit
So approach correct
Your approach work
There hard fast rule scheduling
The number executed parallel depends internal organization CPU
Clearly reload program counter PC save content nothing stopping u saving content leading clock signal loading new content trailing edge
Maybe transfer share component datapath bus making transfer
Where come

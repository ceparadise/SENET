In also LCA set recent individual organism group directly
The term also used reference ancestry group rather organism
The MRCA set individual sometimes determined referring established
However general impossible identify exact MRCA large set individual estimate time MRCA lived often given
Such estimate given based DNA test result established practiced reference mathematical model computer simulation
In organism using MRCAs given population considering descent respectively
The MRCA population definition older either matrilinear patrilinear MRCA
In case matrilinear patrilinear MRCA also known respectively
The age unknown
It necessarily younger age estimated around year may recent year ago
The LUCA recent common ancestor current life Earth estimated lived billion year ago
The project complete description phylogeny biological specie dubbed
This involves time estimate known event example MRCA
MRCA estimated lived order million year ago
The concept last common ancestor perspective described popular audience
Dawkins list concestors order increasing age including stage total
It also possible consider ancestry individual group gene instead organism whole
describes stochastic model ancestry genetic marker map history population
Unlike organism gene passed generation organism next generation either perfect replica slightly mutated
While organism ancestry graph progeny graph via gene single chain ancestor tree descendant
An organism produced sexual least two ancestor immediate parent gene always one ancestor per generation
mtDNA nearly immune sexual mixing unlike whose chromosome shuffled recombined
Mitochondrial DNA therefore used trace find also known recent common ancestor human via mitochondrial DNA pathway
Likewise present single sex chromosome male individual passed male descendant without recombination
It used trace inheritance find recent common ancestor human via pathway
Mitochondrial Eve Adam established researcher using
Mitochondrial Eve estimated lived year ago
A paper published March determined provided study data Adam lived year ago
The MRCA human alive today would therefore need lived recently either
It complicated infer human ancestry via
Although autosomal chromosome contains gene passed parent child via one two parent mix gene parent thus changing genetic composition chromosome
Different type MRCAs estimated lived different time past
These estimate also computed differently depending type MRCA considered
Patrilineal matrilineal MRCAs Mitochondrial Eve Adam traced single gene marker thus TMRCA computed based DNA test result established mutation rate practiced genetic genealogy
Time genealogical MRCA living human computed based mathematical model computer simulation
Since Mitochondrial Eve Adam traced single gene via single ancestral parent line time genetic MRCAs necessarily greater genealogical MRCA
This single gene coalesce slowly tracing conventional human genealogy via parent
The latter considers individual human without taking account whether gene computed MRCA actually survives every single person current population
Mitochondrial DNA used trace ancestry set population
In case population defined accumulation mutation mtDNA special tree created mutation order occurred population
The tree formed testing large number individual world presence lack certain set mutation
Once done possible determine many mutation separate one population another
The number mutation together estimated mutation rate mtDNA region tested allows scientist determine approximate time MRCA indicates time passed since population last shared set mutation belonged
In case DNA TMRCA arrived different way
defined various region
The time MRCA within haplogroup defined accumulation mutation sequence haplogroup
network analysis showing cluster indicates variability due multiple founding individual
Analysis yielding star cluster regarded representing population descended single ancestor
In case variability sequence also called variation regarded measure time passed since ancestor founded particular population
The one ancestor represents famous star cluster dated back time Genghis Khan
TMRCA calculation considered critical evidence attempting determine migration date various population spread around world
For example mutation deemed occurred year ago mutation found amongst population diverged date
If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread formation regionally isolated population must reflected isolation subsequent genetic mutation region
If genetic divergence regional divergence coincide concluded observed divergence due migration evidenced archaeological record
However date genetic divergence occurs different time archaeological record scientist look alternate archaeological evidence explain genetic divergence
The issue best illustrated debate surrounding versus
The age MRCA unknown
It necessarily younger age either matrilinear patrilinear MRCA estimated age roughly year ago
Due pervasive contact formerly separated human population since human MRCA may recent year ago
Note age MRCA population correspond let alone first couple
It rather reflects presence single individual high reproductive success past whose genetic contribution become pervasive throughout population time

estimated MRCA population native even much medieval specifically due century
It also incorrect assume MRCA passed indeed genetic information every living person
Through ancestor pass half gene descendant next generation generation contribution single ancestor would order number proportional le single basepair within
The MRCA recent ancestor shared individual population consideration
This MRCA may well contemporary also ancestral extant population
The point past remote MRCA time longer organism ancestral modern population
Due modern individual may still exhibit due vastly different contribution ancestral population

I set table actually stubby tree
At top Customer Invoices Invoice Detail record
In actuality two dozen table referring Customer principle apply three table
What I like copy Customer record belonging Customer without enumerate every single field every record
Everything constrained thing table identity field
Below script set database
Yes messy complete
So I want make copy Bob database call without hassle specifying column every table
I could Real World LOT column
The problem I write explicit loop get invoice
I need identity previous Invoice insert order write Invoice Detail
I got working C copy program I like database
The naive implementation transact sql stored procedure loop cursor everywhere
Is way avoiding one issue
I similar problem much table involved
We indeed avoid making cursor row copied
The cursor looping list table name involved
We also going need dynamic SQL
The whole operation extremely fast compared traditional cursor loop solution
The trick insert relevant row table update FK column parent
How collect mass identity making use keyword insertion save temporary table refTrack
Later join refTrack table involved updating FKs
We know populate temporary refTrack table list newly created auto running number
Our job make insert query dynamic
The drawback method need consistency table must Steps taken A
List table name tList table variable I love go abstract populating column insertion dynamically populate rest column updating result recursive CTE view
However could beside point
Let assume table list table name involved ordered way populated
Loop tList table cursor
The content FnGetColumns I sure improve script far dynamic
But sake solving problem would minimum requirement
Cheers Ari
table identity field There part problem
Using IDENTITY PK make kind operation difficult costly computing standpoint
Even use IDENTITY though still going need generate new invoice number new customer mean going need either cycle one time come method assigning new invoice number used create invoice detail row
I going assume understand getting business perspective I still point also creating data exactly real
If copy one customer including invoice report sale year going sale
With information business problem trying solve maybe another solution could found

In iOS app using size class get iPad different layout portrait landscape I orientation I activate deactivate
This worked great introduction Container View
I adding new VC separate tab item iPhone version I embed iPad layout using Container View
I focus one size class RegularRegular
The container view constraint Trailing Leading Top Bottom
When I run app look fine single orientation
Now I add constraint message fails following error message Terminating app due uncaught exception reason activate constraint item layer contentOffset contentSize common ancestor
Does constraint reference item different view hierarchy
That illegal
The constraint reference item different view hierarchy
Top Bottom Leading relation another view also VC view
The Trailing relation stepper also VC view
So hierarchal level knowledge
When debug I see constraint start property
This appears normal constraint started prior set
I checked loop setting property
Is something I wrong constraint Container View
Are constraint Container View somehow special Container View
I tried finding answer I ca seem find anything regard issue I
Any help would greatly appreciated
In image container Leading Top Bottom constraint relation view right container
The Trailing constraint relation stepper
Related code These constraint array When debug I see constraint start active property nil That remark make wonder whether might misinterpreting
Despite name despite misleading entry documentation actually add remove constraint
Thus instead confusing command I would suggest might better call directly
The advantage These latter UIView method conscious control view constraint added
When removing clear responsibility retain removed constraint want use later
I realize answer question directly provide enough info show code call show diagram view controller view hierarchy etc
entirely clear going wrong
Instead I trying get reorient try work detail problem
The issue container view time constraint applied
I time size class must yet determined
To resolve I Container View installed AnyAny
Then I deselected size class I want present
I eventually discovered issue Container View

In two node DAG lowest
deepest node descendant define node descendant direct connection lowest common ancestor
The LCA shared ancestor located farthest root
Computation lowest common ancestor may useful instance part procedure determining distance pair node tree distance computed distance root plus distance root minus twice distance root lowest common ancestor
In lowest common ancestor also known
In node point parent lowest common ancestor easily determined finding first intersection path root
In general computational time required algorithm height tree length longest path leaf root
However exist several algorithm processing tree lowest common ancestor may found quickly
example preprocesses tree linear time provide LCA query
In general DAGs similar algorithm exist complexity
The lowest common ancestor problem defined Dov Harel first develop optimally efficient lowest common ancestor data structure
Their algorithm process tree linear time using subsequent lowest common ancestor query may answered constant time per query
However data structure complex difficult implement
Tarjan also found simpler le efficient algorithm based data structure
Baruch Schieber simplified data structure Harel Tarjan leading implementable structure asymptotic preprocessing query time bound
Their simplification based principle two special kind tree lowest common ancestor easy determine tree path lowest common ancestor computed simply minimum level two queried node tree node may indexed way lowest common ancestor reduce simple binary operation index
The structure Schieber Vishkin decomposes tree collection path connection path structure binary tree combine two simpler indexing technique
Omer Berkman Uzi Vishkin discovered completely new way answer lowest common ancestor query achieving linear preprocessing time constant query time
Their method involves forming graph formed input tree doubling every edge using tour write sequence level number node order tour visit lowest common ancestor query transformed query seek minimum value occurring within subinterval sequence number
They handle problem combining two technique one technique based precomputing answer large interval size power two based table lookup query
This method later presented simplified form Michael Bender
As previously observed range minimum problem turn transformed back lowest common ancestor problem using technique
Further simplification made
A variant problem dynamic LCA problem data structure prepared handle LCA query intermixed operation change tree rearrange tree adding removing edge This variant solved using O logN time modification query
This done maintaining forest using dynamic tree data structure partitioning size maintains decomposition tree allows LCA query carried logarithmic time size tree
Without preprocessing also improve naïve online algorithm computation time O log storing path tree using random access list still permitting tree extended constant time
This allows LCA query carried logarithmic time height tree
While originally studied context tree notion lowest common ancestor defined directed acyclic graph DAGs using either two possible definition
In edge DAG assumed point parent child
In tree lowest common ancestor unique DAG node pair node may much LCAs existence LCA pair node even guaranteed arbitrary connected DAGs
A algorithm finding lowest common ancestor given find ancestor return maximum element intersection two set
Better algorithm exist analogous LCA algorithm tree preprocess graph enable LCA query
The problem solved optimally sparse DAGs mean algorithm due
present unified framework Directed Acyclic Graphs DAGs compute least upper bound two vertex constant time
Their framework us adaptive asymptotic cost depend number cross edge DAG
Consequently possible achieve time sparse DAGs constant time LCA
A library work available public use
present method extends computation LCA disjunctive ancestor semantic similarity measure
He defines ancestor disjunctive difference number distinct path two node ancestor different using lower common ancestor
The problem computing lowest common ancestor class arises implementation system
The LCA problem also find application model found

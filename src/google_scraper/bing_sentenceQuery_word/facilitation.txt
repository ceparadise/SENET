What Social Facilitation
Zajonck Theory Social facilitation hold people tendency perform better simple task presence people
For instance presence others facilitate reflexive response
Rajecki Ickes Corcoran Lenerz conducted study explain influence social affiliation behavior utilizing term mere presence
He defined term mere presence refer proximity participant involving sample blindfolded college woman
According Rajecki et al theory Zajonck meant rule specific factor competition rivalry directive cue one organism another various form social reinforcement
In study Rajeck et al found presence audience sufficient condition permit arousal behavior another human subject
Further found improvement responding regardless whether person could evaluate performance see see
They explain possible antecedent mere effect presence either potentially evaluative mere presence audience facilitates performance increasing drive
How definition social facilitation evolved
Besides influencing behavior presence others
This solution describes definition social facilitation evolved discus concept personal space territoriality differ

We accustomed thinking teacher leader classroom
Essentially people tell u think think
They show u relate subject matter give u example understand message
While common view considering role teacher classroom setting accurate hear teacher facilitator learning
More school college advising teacher shift role sole classroom leader one aid student leading
They recognizing powerful kind learning come told think learning think oneself
A therefore teacher operate traditional concept teaching rather meant guide assist student learning picking apart idea forming thought owning material dialogue
Imagine walking hallway college psychology building
There two class across hall learn positive reinforcement
To right classroom teacher operating role typical
reinforcement begin person receives reward behaving certain way inclined repeat behavior
For example child cry grocery store mother give cookie order stop cry child encouraged cry future order get cookie
You take break glance classroom teacher acting facilitator learning
She say class favorite candy bar
Got
If knew every time answered one question class I would give favorite candy bar would try keep answering one question every time meet
Several student agreed
example positive reinforcement
In minute I going put small group try come time noticed used positive reinforcement daily life
Do see first teacher explains definition positive reinforcement second make experience student
What second teacher encourages student look share positive reinforcement applicable life
There still guidance assistance teacher latter example kind sole leadership held first
Instead latter collaboration student exploration
A facilitator role bring subject discussion encourage sharing thought enable student take responsibility learning
Dividing class small group agenda topic cover common method encouraging learning
So introducing concept sharing student important well getting feedback idea relates life
Outside assignment may given teacher give certain guideline project student pick rest detail
The result project personal student lasting impact

The reason many educational institution desiring teacher take role facilitator learning know benefit hold student
When student asked question given chance figure thing taught take responsibility learning
They learn think critically likely absorb learn
The lesson become personally relevant apply topic hand daily life
Michael Sunnarborg philosophy professor University Phoenix said changing role teacher facilitator learning make transition facilitator I change mindset
I realized understanding leading learner new understanding within
My job tell job stimulate thinking encourage exploration make association connector
I discovered teachable moment occurs mind mine
When move teacher facilitator leverage shared experience wisdom learner provide environment applied learning take place

describes benefit least one participant cause harm neither
Facilitations categorized specie benefit one specie benefit unaffected
Much classic ecological theory separation dynamic focused negative interaction positive interaction facilitation receiving increasing focus ecological research
This article address mechanism facilitation increasing information available concerning impact facilitation
There two basic category facilitative interaction Strict categorization however possible complex specie interaction
For example seed survival harsh environment often higher open ground
A nurse plant one established canopy beneath germination survival likely due increased shade soil moisture nutrient
Thus relationship seedling nurse plant commensal
However seedling grow established plant likely compete former benefactor resource
The beneficial effect specie one another realized various way including refuge physical stress predation competition improved resource availability transport
Facilitation may act reducing negative impact stressful environment
As described nurse plant facilitate seed germination survival alleviating stressful environmental condition
A similar interaction occurs red alga seaweed site southern USA
The alga survives higher intertidal temperature desiccation stress seaweed present canopy seaweed offer protection stress
The previous example describe facilitation individual single specie also instance single facilitator specie mediating stress
An example facilitation substrate stabilization cobble beach plant community USA smooth cordgrass
Large bed cordgrass buffer wave action thus allowing establishment persistence community le mark
In general facilitation likely occur physically stressful environment favorable environment competition may important interaction among specie
This also occur single habitat containing gradient low high stress
For example along New England USA salt marsh tidal gradient presence black needle rush increased fitness marsh elder shrub lower elevation higher
The rush shaded soil decreased turn decreased soil salinity
However higher elevation soil salinity lower marsh elder fitness decreased presence rush due increased competition resource
Thus nature specie interaction may shift environmental condition
Another mechanism facilitation reduced risk eaten
Nurse plant example reduce stress may also physically seedling growing
In terrestrial marine environment palatable specie reduced occur unpalatable specie
These associational refuge may occur unpalatable specie physically shield palatable specie herbivore confused inhibitory cue unpalatable specie
Herbivory also reduce predation herbivore case along USA coastline
This crab specie take refuge branch compact feed seaweed vicinity coral
The reduced competition seaweed enhances coral growth turn provides refuge crab
A similar case interaction acacia tree spp
certain ant spp

The acacia provides nourishment protection inside hollow thorn ant return defense herbivore
In contrast different type facilitation ant insect may increase plant predation
By consuming sap plant pest produce waste product called consumed ant exchange protection predation
Another potential benefit facilitation insulation competitive interaction
Like familiar example nurse plant harsh environment forest site increased seed germination seedling survival raised substrate log free seedling competition plant moss forest floor
The interaction described also example refuge competition since herbivory crab seaweed reduces competition coral seaweed
Similarly herbivory sea urchin kelp spp
protect overgrowth kelp competing space USA
Facilitation increase access limiting resource light water nutrient interacting specie
For example plant often receive direct sunlight canopy host plant would ground
Also nurse plant increase amount water available seedling dry habitat reduced evapotranspiration beneath shade nurse plant canopy
However familiar example increased access resource facilitation mutualistic transfer nutrient symbiotic organism
A prolonged close association organism example mutualistic symbioses include The movement animal item involved plant reproduction usually mutualistic association
Pollinators may increase plant reproductive success reducing pollen waste increasing pollen increasing probability sexual reproduction low
In return pollinator receives nourishment form nectar pollen
Animals may also disperse seed fruit plant either eating case receive benefit nourishment passive transport seed sticking fur feather
Although facilitation often studied level individual specie interaction effect facilitation often observable scale community including impact spatial structure
Many facilitative interaction directly affect distribution specie
As discussed transport plant propagules animal dispersers increase colonization rate distant site may impact distribution population dynamic plant specie
Facilitation often affect distribution simply making possible specie occur site environmental stress would otherwise prohibit growth specie
This apparent facilitation foundation specie sediment stabilization cobble beach plant community smooth cordgrass
A facilitating specie may also help drive progression one ecosystem type another apparently grassland
As tree mesquite establishes readily specie soil following establishment mesquite act nurse plant seedling specie
Thus mesquite facilitates dynamic spatial shift across habitat
Facilitation affect community diversity defined context number specie community altering competitive interaction
For example intertidal mussel increase total community specie diversity displacing competitive large specie
Although mussel decrease diversity primary space holder large sessile specie larger number specie associated mussel bed primary space holder total specie diversity higher mussel present
The effect facilitation diversity could also reversed facilitation creates competitive dominance excludes specie permit
Facilitation specie either native specie specie may increase invasibility community ease specie become established community
In examination published study interaction studied introduced specie study facilitative
It worth noting examined interaction relationship single insect reported single study may overemphasized importance negative interaction
Introduced plant also facilitated native pollinator
Thus positive interaction must considered attempt understand invasibility community
Facilitation significant ecological process produce effect individual interaction
By improving dispersal increasing access resource providing protection stress predation competition facilitation impact community structure diversity invasibility
Incorporation facilitation classic theory natural selection niche separation goal current future
This require research mechanism facilitation level individual impact facilitation level population community ecosystem
Continued study positive specie interaction serve improve understanding process application theory

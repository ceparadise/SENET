I studying lisp language lisp routine general context know routine technical context talk starting learn routine
So real definition routine
already googled find anything The term derives common term language like BASIC one actually creates SUBroutines
BASIC actually difference SUBroutine FUNCTION nevertheless From Wikipedia entry In computer science subroutine As name subprogram suggests subroutine behaves much way computer program used one step larger program another subprogram
A subroutine often coded started called several time several place single execution program including subroutine branch back return next instruction call subroutine task done
Different different ecosystem thus different term describe general concept
I generally use term OOP environment day
Happy coding
For fun I Community
The list hopefully cover term correct widely accepted use given language mean
Informally used context language omitted unless defacto term used
Feel free add correct annotate appropriate
You ca find technical definition technical definition specific lisp
A outside vaudeville another name function
While many year since I programmed Lisp one ever used term formal way even used commonly
We talked
If someone said routine calculate many apple pie perfectly informal

In sequence program instruction perform specific task packaged unit
This unit used program wherever particular performed
Subprograms may defined within program separately used multiple program
In different programming language subroutine may called
The generic term sometimes used
The name suggests subroutine behaves much way computer program used one step larger program another subprogram
A subroutine often coded started called several time several place one execution program including subroutine branch back next instruction subroutine task done
credited invention concept termed contrasted
Subroutines powerful tool many includes support writing using
Judicious use subroutine example approach often substantially reduce cost developing maintaining large program increasing quality reliability
Subroutines often collected important mechanism sharing trading software
The discipline based subroutine attached object object
In method called executable program basically sequence subroutine call
The content subroutine body piece program code executed subroutine called invoked
A subroutine may written expects obtain one data value calling program replace formal parameter
The calling program provides actual value parameter called
Different programming language may use different convention passing argument The subroutine may return computed value caller provide various result value output parameter
Indeed common use subroutine implement purpose subroutine purely compute one result whose value entirely determined argument passed subroutine
Examples might include computing number
A subroutine call may also modifying reading writing creating halting program machine even delaying program execution specified time
A subprogram side effect may return different result time called even called argument
An example available many language return different number time called
The widespread use subroutine side effect characteristic language
A subroutine coded may one place perform task
This method allows direct implementation function defined recursive
A subroutine whose purpose compute one answer question sometimes called predicate
In language often subroutine called predicate since primarily determine success failure
For example type function subroutine main
usually include specific construct Some many distinguish function function subprogram provide explicit return value calling program subroutine procedure
In language function call normally embedded function may called
Procedure call either behave syntactically procedure may called explicitly invoked statement

Other language distinguish function subroutine
In strictly language subprogram mean various internal state program change
Functions always return result repeatedly called argument
Such language typically support function since subroutine return value use unless cause side effect
In subroutine may also simply called function confused different concept
A language usually translate procedure call return machine instruction according subroutine compiled separately program call
The instruction sequence corresponding call return statement called procedure
The advantage breaking program subroutine include Invoking subroutine versus using code imposes call mechanism
A subroutine typically requires standard code entry exit function usually saving return address minimum
The idea subroutine worked computing machine already existed time
The arithmetic conditional jump instruction planned ahead time changed relatively little special instruction used procedure call changed greatly year
The earliest computer microprocessor single subroutine call instruction
Subroutines could implemented required programmer use call series
Some early computer microprocessor subroutine call us dedicated hardware stack store return hardware support level subroutine nesting support recursive subroutine
Machines mid use saved instruction counter first memory location called subroutine
This allows arbitrarily deep level subroutine nesting support recursive subroutine
The one first computer subroutine call instruction feature support arbitrarily deep subroutine nesting also support recursive subroutine
In early assembler subroutine support limited
Subroutines explicitly separated main program indeed source code subroutine could interspersed subprogram
Some assembler would offer predefined generate call return sequence
By assembler usually much sophisticated support inline separately assembled subroutine could linked together
Even cumbersome approach subroutine proved useful
For one thing allowed use code many different program
Moreover memory scarce resource early computer subroutine allowed significant saving size program
Many early computer loaded program instruction memory
Each subroutine could provided separate piece tape loaded spliced main program mainline subroutine tape could used many different program
A similar approach applied computer used main input
The name originally meant library literal sense kept indexed collection tape collective use
To remove need computer designer eventually provided instruction whose operand instead location variable containing return address
On computer instead modifying subroutine return jump calling program would store return address variable subroutine completed would execute indirect jump would direct execution location given predefined variable
Another advance instruction combined saving return address calling jump thereby minimizing significantly
In IBM example branch instruction BAL BALR designed procedure calling would save return address processor register specified instruction
To return subroutine execute indirect branch instruction BR register
If subroutine needed register purpose calling another subroutine would save register content private memory location register
In system JSB instruction would perform similar task except return address stored memory location target branch
Execution procedure would actually begin next memory location
In HP assembly language one would write example call subroutine called MYSUB main program
The subroutine would coded The JSB instruction placed address NEXT instruction namely BB location specified operand namely MYSUB branched NEXT location namely AA MYSUB
The subroutine could return main program executing indirect jump JMP MYSUB I branched location stored location MYSUB
Compilers Fortran language could easily make use instruction available
This approach supported multiple level call however since return address parameter return value subroutine assigned fixed memory location allow recursive call
Incidentally similar method used early discover recalculation dependency spreadsheet
Namely location reserved cell store address
Since allowed natural recalculation order allows tree walk without reserving space stack memory limited small computer
Most modern implementation use special case implement subroutine call return
Each procedure call creates new entry called top stack procedure return stack frame deleted stack space may used procedure call
Each stack frame contains corresponding call typically includes procedure parameter internal variable return address
The call sequence implemented sequence ordinary instruction approach still used RISC VLIW architecture many traditional machine designed since late included special instruction purpose
The call stack usually implemented contiguous area memory
It arbitrary design choice whether bottom stack lowest highest address within area stack may grow forward backwards memory however many architecture chose latter
Some design notably implementation used two separate stack one mainly control information like return address loop counter data
The former worked like call stack indirectly accessible programmer language construct latter directly accessible
When procedure call first introduced important motivation save precious memory
With scheme compiler reserve separate space memory private data parameter return address local variable procedure
At moment stack contains private data call currently namely called returned yet
Because way program usually assembled library still uncommon find program include thousand subroutine handful active given moment
For program call stack mechanism could save significant amount memory
Indeed call stack mechanism viewed earliest simplest method
However another advantage call stack method allows since nested call procedure get separate instance private data
One disadvantage call stack mechanism increased cost procedure call matching return
The extra cost includes incrementing decrementing stack pointer architecture checking accessing local variable parameter address instead absolute address
The cost may realized increased execution time increased processor complexity
This overhead obvious objectionable return without making procedure call
To reduce overhead many modern compiler try delay use call stack really needed
For example call procedure may store return address parameter called procedure certain processor register transfer control procedure body simple jump
If procedure return without making call call stack used
If need call another procedure use call stack save content register return address needed return
In programming language subprogram termed classified associated
These language use special keyword indicate function take parameter especially C return value
Note function including modifying variable whose address passed parameter
Examples The function return value called function This function return result number call part expression This function convert number initial letter corresponding day week namely
The result calling might assigned variable
This function return value modifies variable whose address passed parameter would called
In example call subroutine define actual subroutine keyword must used subroutine name following
After content followed must typed
In language subprogram termed associated class
Visual Basic us various term called define passed parameter
By default unspecified variable registered passed default
Also function sub declared given public private friend designation determines whether accessed outside module project declared
The function return value called function This function return result number call part expression This function convert number initial letter corresponding day week namely
The result calling might assigned variable
This function return value modifies variable whose address passed parameter would called
In called procedure may passed providing information argument string length array bound
This allows procedure general eliminates need programmer pas information
By default pass argument reference
A trivial subroutine change sign element array might look like This could called various array follows A subprogram may find useful make use certain amount space used execution subprogram hold intermediate result
Variables stored scratch space termed scratch space termed
An activation record typically tell pas control back subprogram finish
A subprogram may number nature call site
If recursion supported subprogram may even call causing execution suspend another execution subprogram occurs
useful mean simplify complex algorithm break complex problem
Recursive language generally provide new copy local variable call
If programmer desire value local variable stay call declared language global value common area used
Here example recursive subroutine find number Early language like initially support recursion variable statically allocated well location return address
Most computer late support hardware stack register
Modern language almost invariably use stack usually supported modern computer instruction set provide fresh activation record every execution subprogram
That way nested execution free modify local variable without concern effect suspended execution progress
As nested call accumulate structure formed consisting one activation record suspended subprogram
In fact stack structure virtually ubiquitous activation record commonly termed
Some language also support subroutine callable within outer parent subroutine
Inner subroutine access local variable outer subroutine called
This accomplished storing extra context information within activation record also termed
If subprogram executed properly even another execution subprogram already progress subprogram said
A recursive subprogram must reentrant
Reentrant subprogram also useful situation since multiple thread call subprogram without fear interfering
In slightly le restrictive similar requirement application program shared many thread
In environment generally one stack
An environment fully support may use data structure stack store activation record
In sometimes desirable number function name operating different type data different parameter profile
For example square root function might defined operate real complex value matrix
The algorithm used case different return result may different
By writing three separate function name programmer convenience remember different name type data
Further subtype defined real separate positive negative real two function written real one return real parameter positive another return complex value parameter negative
In series function name accept different parameter profile parameter different type function said
Here example subroutine overloading In code two function name different parameter
As another example subroutine might construct accept direction trace path point screen
There plethora parameter could passed constructor colour trace starting x trace speed
If programmer wanted constructor able accept color parameter could call another constructor accepts color turn call constructor parameter passing set parameter X Y would generally centered screen placed origin speed would set another value coder choosing
A subprogram together value variable captured environment created
Closures notable feature Lisp programming language introduced
Depending implementation closure serve mechanism
A wide number convention coding subroutine developed
Pertaining naming many developer adopted approach name subroutine certain task make inquiry used substitute variable
Some programmer suggest subroutine perform one task subroutine perform one task split subroutine
They argue subroutine key component role program must remain distinct
Proponents modularizing code advocate subroutine minimal dependency piece code
For example use generally deemed unwise advocate perspective add tight coupling subroutine global variable
If coupling necessary advice subroutine accept passed instead
However increasing number parameter passed subroutine affect code readability
Besides effect subroutine may need inform calling program condition may occurred execution
In language programming standard often done integer value placed subroutine standard location encodes normal exceptional condition
In return code expected subroutine return value often designed multiple could used direct index branch table often located immediately call instruction avoid extra conditional test improving efficiency
In one would write example There significant runtime calling subroutine including passing argument branching subprogram branching back caller
The overhead often includes saving restoring certain processor register allocating reclaiming call frame storage
In language subroutine call also implies automatic testing subroutine return code handling may raise
In language significant source overhead intensively used method call
There seemingly obvious optimization procedure call applied procedure may side effect
For example expression function must called twice two call may return different result
Moreover value must fetched second call since first call may changed
Determining whether subprogram may side effect difficult indeed
So optimization safe purely functional programming language compiler typical imperative programming usually assume worst
A method used eliminate overhead subprogram body versus branching subroutine back
Not avoid call overhead also allows procedure effectively taking account context argument call
The inserted body optimized compiler
Inlining however usually increase code size unless program contains one call subroutine subroutine body le code call overhead

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What open activation record recursive algorithm
Edit Activation record number time call function finished yet
Correct
So find number activation record given specific input array say something general array dimension Or
Your question poorly stated except title
There single sentence really correct meaningful semantically
So I stick title explain wrongt text
programming language implementation concept
Programming language used implement algorithm program concept algorithm abstract notion rather concrete realization specific programming language
An activation record chunk memory containing usually local data necessary execute subprogram call name vary language function procedure method subroutine well memory code control flow
More dynamic part data used may stored place heap
Thus activation record number whatever
But number activation record use general correspond number call returned though necessarily true language see
In simpler programming language subprogram call well nested first subprogram returned last one called
Hence activation record stored pushdown stack
That apply control structure
Also may data activation record still used program subprogram returned
This happens example result subprogram another subprogram executed later I skip detail
So case one may keep memory activation record unfinished call
And pushdown stack longer work properly without specific technique handle problem
Last general concept
I idea input array program
So I answer
Many program array activation record

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

We appreciate interest causality hope hear view subject
I also received interesting question end talk I could fully answer short break
I try answer
Revolution poetic word summarize Gary King observation More learned causal inference last decade sum total everything learned prior recorded history see cover Morgan Winship book
It capture miracle three decade ago could write formula Mud cause Rain formulate estimate every causal counterfactual statement
Yes provided two approach start set assumption
The assumption graphical approach advertised graph potential outcome approach articulated separately investigator using counterfactual vocabulary
Imputation work certain assumption conditional ignorability hold
The table show u assumption mean
To see mean need graph since mortal process assumption head
The apparent difference procedure reflects insistence graphical framework seeing assumption rather wishing away
No way
Mathematically speaking economic problem different faced epidemiologist social scientist graphical model become second language
Moreover epidemiologist never complained graph force model entirety human anatomy
among economist cultural phenomenon reminiscent among Church astronomer century Italy
Bottom line epidemiologist judge plausibility assumption economist
I offered many opportunity demonstrate public I blame remaining silent problem managed unaided intellect No matter acrobatics go minimize overfitting flaw learning strategy still optimizing property observed data making reference world outside data
This put right back Ladder Causation limitation entail
If additional question topic feel free post blog anonymity respected I try best answer

Rodrigo Pinto Randomized Trials
The video lecture The Eight Pillars Causal Wisdom watched A transcript talk found As part celebration year Turing Award ACM organized several discussion session selected topic computer science
I participated panel discussion Advances Deep Neural Networks gave opportunity share thought whether learning method based solely data fitting ever achieve intelligence
The discussion video viewed A position paper defends thought available An article title authored Nancy Krieger George Davey Smith appeared International Journal Epidemiology IJE
It part special IJE issue causal analysis reason outlined interest reader blog
As title u author unhappy direction modern epidemiology taken wedded framework Graphical model DAGs express know Counterfactuals potential outcome express wish know
The specific reason author unhappiness still puzzling article demonstrate concrete alternative current methodology
I speculate however dazzling speed epidemiology modernized tool lie behind author discomfort
If would safe u assume discomfort subside soon researcher gain greater familiarity capability flexibility new tool
I nevertheless recommend article entire special issue IJE studied reader reflect interesting attempt discipline ass progress wake profound paradigm shift
Epidemiology I written several occasion pioneer accepting symbiosis ruling paradigm way ahead mainstream statistic satellite
The social science example almost exception branch econometrics
See posting In examining specific limitation Krieger Davey Smith perceive DAGs reader amused note limitation coincide precisely strength DAGs praised
For example article complains DAGs provide information variable investigator chose include model
In word DAG provide comprehensive picture
For example include paternal factor ethnicity respiratory infection socioeconomic taken Editorial introduction
I never considered limitation DAGs scientific modelling
Quite contrary
It would disaster model permitted provide information unintended modeller
Instead I learned admire ease DAGs enable researcher incorporate knowledge new variable new mechanism modeller wish embrace
Model misspecification problem plague every exercise causal inference matter framework one chooses adapt
It cured careful strategy enhancing modeller knowledge
Yet come minimizing misspecification error DAGS match
The transparency DAGs display causal assumption model ease DAG identifies testable implication assumption incomparable facilitate speedy model diagnosis repair match sight
Or take another example author call repeatedly ostensibly unavailable methodology label causal triangulation appears time article
In word In field involving dynamic population people dynamic society ecosystem methodical triangulation diverse type evidence diverse type study setting involving diverse population Ironically however task treating diverse type evidence diverse population accomplished quite successfully framework
See example formal complete result Bareinbaum Pearl emerged perspective invoke
See also It inconceivable imagine anyone pooling data two different design say experimental observational without resorting DAGs equivalently potential outcome I open learn
Another conceptual paradigm author hope would liberate u tyranny DAGs counterfactuals Lipton romantic aspiration Inference Best It compelling century old mantra going back least Charles Pierce theory abduction Pragmatism Pragmaticism unfortunately never operationalized key term explanation Best inference
Again I know one framework aspiration explicated sufficient precision produce tangible result structural framework DAGs counterfactuals
See example Causes Effects Effects Causes Halpern Pearl Causes explanation A approach In summary Krieger Davey Smith aspire achieve abandoning structural framework already accomplished help grace framework
More generally learn example symbiosis far narrow ONE approach causal inference may potentially lead spurious causal inference word
It fact broad flexible framework within plurality task aspiration formulated analyzed implemented
The quest metaphysical alternative warranted
I pleased note large commentator Krieger Davey Smith paper seemed aware power generality framework albeit exactly reason I described
footnote I many disagreement commentator well I wish focus TALE WAGGED DAG problem appear glaring
My talk The Eight Pillars Causal Wisdom provides concise summary reason explains I take poetic liberty calling pillar The Causal Revolution All I believe epidemiologist commended incredible progress made past two decade
They doubt continue develop benefit new tool symbiosis spawn
At time I hope discomfort Krieger Davey Smith expressed temporary inspire greater understanding modern tool causal inference
Comments special issue IJE invited blog
As know I another book titled The Book Why The new science cause effect
It attempt present eight pillar causal wisdom general public using word intuition example replace equation
My science writer Dana MacKenzie publishing house Basic Books
If go well book see shelf
Selected section appear periodically blog
The structural interpretation counterfactuals formulated Balke Pearl excludes disjunctive conditionals X well disjunctive action
In contrast interpretation Lewis assigns truth value counterfactual sentence regardless logical form antecedant
The next issue Journal Causal Inference include paper extends vocabulary structural counterfactuals disjunction clarifies assumption needed extension

Overturning Econometrics Education need causal interpretation
My attention called recent paper Josh Angrist Pischke titled Undergraduate econometrics instruction A NBER working paper This paper advocate pedagogical paradigm shift methodological ramification beyond econometrics instruction As I understand shift stand contrary traditional teaching causal inference defined Sewall Wright Haavelmo Marschak Wold founding father econometrics methodology
In nut shell Angrist Pischke start set favorite statistical routine IV regression among others search set control variable needed insure effect variable interest causal interpretation
Traditional causal inference including economics teach u asking whether output statistical routine causal interpretation wrong question ask miss direction analysis
Instead one start target causal parameter asks whether ESTIMABLE IV regression perhaps new routine yet discovered ordained name
Clearly causal interpretation needed parameter intrinsically causal example causal effect path coefficient direct effect effect treatment treated probability causation
In practical term difference two paradigm estimability requires substantive model interpretability appears
A model expose assumption explicitly statistical routine give deceptive impression run hence popular appeal
The former lends judgmental statistical test latter escape scrutiny
In conclusion educator need choose interpretability estimability paradigm I would go latter
If traditional econometrics education tailored support estimability track I believe paradigm shift warranted towards interpretation seeking paradigm one proposed Angrist Pischke I would gladly open blog additional discussion topic
I tried post comment NBER National Bureau Economic Research rejected approved NBER family member
If reader NBER family member feel free post
Note NBER working paper circulated discussion comment page
Dear friend causality research This greeting UCLA Causality blog contains news discussion following topic
Reflections JSM meeting

The question equivalent representation

Simpson Paradox Comments four recent paper
News concerning Causal Inference Primer
New book blog frill

Reflections For missed JSM meeting tutorial slide viewed As see I argue current progress causal inference viewed major paradigm shift history statistic accordingly nuance disagreement merely linguistic realignments within unified framework
To support view I chose discussion six specific achievement called GEMS make anyone connected causal analysis proud empowered mighty motivated
The six gem
Policy Evaluation Estimating Treatment Effects
Attribution Analysis Causes Effects
Mediation Analysis Estimating Direct Indirect Effects
Generalizability Establishing External Validity
Coping Selection Bias
Recovering Missing Data I hope enjoy slide appreciate gem

The question equivalent representation One challenging question came audience JSM concerned unification graphical framework
How two logically equivalent representation different actual use
I elaborate question separate post titled Logically equivalent yet way
Simpson Paradox The riddle would die Comments four recent paper If search Google Simpson paradox I yesterday would get result statistical paradox I could name
What elevates innocent reversal association paradoxical status captured fascination statistician mathematician philosopher century question discussed length blog
The reason I back topic publication four recent paper give u panoramic view understanding causal reasoning progressed community usually participate discussion

News concerning Causal Inference A Primer We grateful Jim Grace review Amazon For awaiting solution study question Primer I informed Solution Manual available instructor Wiley
To obtain copy see page However rumor quicker way get local Wiley representative If encounter difficulty please contact u try help
Readers tell solution enlightening text
I surprised nothing invigorating seeing problem solved A Z

New book blog frill We informed new book Joseph Halpern titled Actual Causality available MIT Press

Readers familiar Halpern fundamental contribution causal reasoning surprised find fresh comprehensive solution problem actual causality
Not missed
Adam Kelleher writes interesting blog orchestrating
See post Glenn Shafer published review paper A Mathematical Theory Evidence turn celebrating anniversary publication book A Mathematical Theory Evidence I enjoyed reading article nostalgic reason reminding stormy day everyone arguing another calculus evidential reasoning
My last contribution storm sailing causality land paper
Section Shafer article deal book The Art Causal Conjecture My thought Now causal inference field matured perhaps time take another look way Shafer view causation
Wishing super productive Fall season
Pearl Contributor Judea Pearl In comparing tradeoff structural potential outcome framework I often state two logically equivalent yet pole apart term transparency computational efficiency
See Slide JSM tutorial
Indeed anyone examines two framework solve specific problem begining end See Slides would find difference astonishing
The question naturally arises How two equivalent framework differ substantially actual use
The answer epistemic equivalence mean representational equivalence
Two representation information may highlight different aspect problem thus differ substantially easy solve given problem
This recurrent theme complexity analysis generally appreciated outside computer science
We saw discussion Guido Imbens could accept fact use graphical model mathematical necessity matter taste
The example usually cited complexity analysis combinatorial problem whose solution time depend critically initial representation
I hesitated bringing example fearing compelling reader blog familiar classical mathematics
Last week I stumbled upon simple example demonstrates representational difference ambiguous term I would like share reader
x x ax bx c This tough problem u remember Tartalia solution cubic
It made much tougher go quintic equation
But many syntactic way representing function x
Here one equivalent representation x x x b another x The last representation permit immediate solution
The example may appear trivial may even call cheating saying finding x x x hard solving original problem
This true purpose example produce easy solution cubic
The purpose demonstrate different syntactic way representing information polynomial may lead substantial difference complexity computing answer query find root
A preferred representation one make certain desirable aspect problem explicit thus facilitating speedy solution
Complexity theory full example
Note complexity
Had goal find value x make polynomial x equal zero representation x would offer help
For query representation x This simple example demonstrates nicely principle make graphical model efficient alternative representation causal information say set ignorability assumption
What make graphical model efficient fact make explicit logical ramification conveyed model
Deriving ramification algebraic logical mean take substantially work
See logic counterfactual independency A typical example nasty derivation get given Heckman Pinto paper Causal Inference Haavelmo Econometric Theory
Determined avoid graph cost Heckman Pinto derived conditional independence relation directly Dawid axiom Markov condition See
The result page upon page derivation independency displayed explicitly graph
Of course difficulty dissuade econometrician use graph would rake scientific revolution Kuhnian proportion
see Still awareness complexity issue give inquisitive student ammunition hasten revolution equip econometrics modern tool causal analysis
They eventually
Adam Kelleher The math algorithm reading group based NYC founded I moved three year ago
It casual group grew reading group I graduate school
Some friend math graduate student interested learning general relativity I physicist interested learning math
Together read differential geometry goal bringing knowledge together
We reasoned could learn group pooling different perspective experience could individually
That core motivation reading group help resolve get material anyone get stuck also add else know format group discussion content material
We currently reading cover cover
We paused implement algorithm plan pausing soon review session
We intend hacking session try hand causal inference analysis open data set
Inspired reading realizing best open implementation causal inference packaged old relatively inaccessible Tetrad package I started modern implementation tool causal inference analysis causality package Python
It pypi pip install causality check tutorial still work progress
The algorithm implemented along small suite conditional independence test
I adding classic method causal inference causal effect estimation aimed making package
I invite new contribution help build package
Just open issue label enhancement kick discussion
Finally make work accessible people without advanced math background I writing series blog post aimed introducing anyone intermediate background probability statistic material Causality
It aimed especially practitioner like data scientist
The hope people manager included intended audience first post understand issue come thinking causally
I especially recommend article understanding bias whole series still progress indexed

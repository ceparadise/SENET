I The earliest computing device undoubtedly consisted five finger hand
The word digital come finger
Roman school taught finger counting actually devised method multiplication division finger
The Roman student required learn multiplication table
He would figure product finger
It still actually preferred device every child learns count
Since ten discrete finger digit digital available counting digital computation decimal system enjoyed huge popularity throughout history
However improvement made replace digit hand reliable device
It probably take million year human evolution someone idea could used well finger count thing
The ancient man collected pebble represent number item possessed
He may kept pouch place easily accessible could add subtract stone
In culture stone replaced notch stick knot tied cord mark clay tablet
Whatever method device way represent number
One earliest device
It set three groove sand maximum pebble groove
Each time one wanted increase counter one would add pebble right hand groove
When ten pebble collected right groove removed one pebble added left groove
The word calculate said derived Latin word calcis meaning limestone limestone used first sand table
The form pebble container take handy calculation kept many best mind Stone Age busy century
It till five thousand year ago Valley late BC Egypt arose idea arranging clay board number groove pebble placed
By sliding pebble along groove one side board counting became almost even point allowing one hand kept free thing
The grooved pebble container big thing kept secret long process cultural diffusion
deported slave saw became known China Japan Rome
When diversity race confronted leap future flowering ingenuity sort minor renaissance resulted swept pebble computer high plateau development
One group came idea drilling hole pebble stringing resulting bead group ten frame wire another used reed instead
In either case bead could moved easily rapidly along wire reed tremendous calculation resulted
This device somewhat sophisticated form became known China
The word come word abaq Arab word dust first abacus simply portable sand table board dust strung across
Eventually board replaced frame groove wire pebble bead
People using abacus calculation become extremely skilled rapid computation
In test expert using abacus proven faster person using mechanical calculator
The abacus remained computing device year even table number developed Greek Roman culture well Mesopotamian Egyptians
After reaching first milestone development computer device seems stagnated next two thousand year apparently scientific business calculating need Middle Ages required ten finger abacus
The real beginning modern computer go back seventeenth century
Having divorced past speculation authority intellectual giant Descartes Pascal Leibnitz Napier made new beginning philosophy science mathematics revolutionize ancient view world
In mathematics particularly tremendous progress made attendant calculation became laborious need sophisticated computing machine became urgent
The development Scottish mathematician John Napier stimulated invention various device substituted addition logarithm multiplication
Napier played key role history computing
Besides clergyman philosopher gifted mathematician published great work Logarithms book called Rabdologia
This remarkable invention since enabled transform multiplication division complicated task time simple addition subtraction
His Logarithm table soon became wide spread used many people
Napier often remembered another invention nicknamed Bones
This small instrument constructed rod engraved multiplication table
They refer bone first set made ivory resembled set bone
This simple device enabled carry multiplication fast manner provided one number one digit
X The invention logarithm led directly development
The first Slide Rule appeared result joined effort two Englishmen Edmund Gunter reverent William Oughtred
The principle behind device two scale moving

They gave name astronomical us
The astrolabe truth forerunner modern slide rule nomogram
In Wilhelm Schickard Tuebingen friend astronomer Kepler made
This machine could add subtract indicated overflow ringing bell
Mounted machine set Napier Rods Bones memory aid facilitating multiplication
Perhaps significant evolution mechanical calculator introduction gear Blaise Pascal famous French philopher mathematician
The father Blaise Pascal working tax accounting office
To make father work easier designed age mechanized calculating device Pascaline operated series dial attached wheel number zero nine circumference
When wheel made complete turn advanced wheel left
Indicators dial showed correct answer
Although limited still used adding machine
It long scientist realized toothed wheel could also perform repeated addition number
The German philosopher mathematician Baron von Leibnitz added improvement Pascal machine complete first calculating machine
The Leibnitz based Leibnitz wheel first calculator designed multiply repeated addition mechanical flaw prevented becoming popular
Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar France make first calculator
It multiplication using general approach Leibniz calculator assistance user also
It also reliable calculator yet
Machines general design large enough occupy desktop continue sold year
However like many machine computer device lacked mechanical precision construction unreliable
One invention Industrial Revolution direct relationship computer developed
A Frenchman named Joseph Jacquard perfected first loom weave intricate design cloth
It could weave flower design picture men woman easily loom could weave plain cloth
A famous portrait Jacquard produced using punched card
When Jacquard first introduced machine difficulty gaining public acceptance fear machine
In city Lyons physically attacked machine destroyed
What Jacquard punched card essence provide effective mean communicating machine
The language limited two word hole hole
The binary system universal modern day machine
While Thomas Colmar developing desktop calculator Charles Babbage mathematics professor started Cambridge series interesting development computer
He eccentric genius inherited sizable fortune used finance wide range interest
Babbage contribution range developing technique distributing mail investigating volcanic phenomenon breaking supposedly unbreakable code
If Babbage never thought computer may died happy man
But like inventor tried free man slavery computation
In Babbage realized many long calculation especially needed make mathematical table really series predictable action constantly repeated
From suspected possible
He began design automatic mechanical calculating machine called
By working model demonstrate
The machine advantage able maintain rate computation length time
With financial help British government Babbage started fabrication difference engine
It intended steam powered fully automatic including printing resulting table commanded fixed instruction program
By English government advanced nearly
To people become accustomed power loom created Jacquard inconceivable machine could take work brain
Besides government grant Babbage spent money machine
As turned machine never built kept changing design
A Swedish gentleman finally built machine displayed London
The difference engine although limited adaptability applicability really great advance
Babbage continued work next year lost interest thought better idea construction would called general purpose fully automatic mechanical digital computer
Babbage called idea
It included feature crucial future computer Babbage got idea analytical engine watching loom attachment invented Jacquard
The analytical engine designed read two set material store mathematical operation
The first set material would carried second set material
However Babbage never completed analytical engine progressed far enough someone else complete
But ultimately logical structure modern computer come even one essential feature computer absent design concept necessary implementing compiler
Lady Ada Lovelace daughter Lord Byron became involved development analytical engine
Lady Lovelace helped Babbage financial aid good mathematician wrote article program proposed machine
Many called first woman programmer
It seems computer already used playing game Babbage working automated game Lady Lovelace proposed might used compose music
Boole algebra represents mathematical theory needed perform operation binary system George Boole idea represent information two logic state true false
He gave mathematical idea formula calculation information
Unfortunately exception student philosophy symbolic logic destined remain largely unknown unused better part century Three American inventor friend spent evening tinkering together conceived first practical typewriting machine
In Christopher Latham Sholes Carlos Glidden Samual Soule invented called hyphen discarded year later
It commonly believed original layout key typewriter intended slow typist strictly true
The main inventor first commercial typewriter Christopher Latham Sholes obviously wished make typewriter fast possible order convince people use
However one problem first machine key jammed operator typed real speed Sholes invented become known Sholes keyboard
What Sholes attempted separate letter many common digraph possible
But addition pain use resulting layout also left something desired digraph front example ed er th tr use key close
Unfortunately even jamming problem overcome use spring monster loose amongst u existing user want change turning back
The original Sholes keyboard known u ordering first six key third row interesting least two reason
First key number inventor decided user could get letter
And second shift key first typewriter could type upper case letter
Sholes also craftily ensured word Typewriter could constructed using top row letter
This intended aid salesman giving demonstration
And nothing simple world instead top row character saying QWERTY keyboard France Germany spell respectively
The first typewriter uppercase lowercase letter made available key appear market quickly challenged another flavor contained twice number key one every uppercase lowercase character
For quite time two alternative vied heart mind typing fraternity advent technique known favored solution thereafter reigned supreme
Finally lest still feel QWERTY keyboard unduly harsh punishment sent try u worth remembering early user much harder time least could even see typing
The first typewriter struck paper underside obliged operator raise carriage whenever wished see typed machine become available Dorr Eugene Felt born Chicago
In made Comptometer first calculator number entered pressing key opposed dialled similar awkward method
A step towards automated computing development punched card first successfully used computer Herman Hollerith James Powers
They working US Census Bureau John Billings made comment Herman Hollerith nineteen year old engineer felt ought mechanical way job
Perhaps way using principle Jacquard loom hole card regulate pattern weave
They went work idea first machine devised used paper strip hole punched according code similar player piano
The paper strip found impractical punched card devised
Hollerith worked system person name age sex relevant information could coded punching hole card
It said size card size dollar bill Hollerith designing card knowing size make pulled one dollar bill traced
However controversy point affirm much smaller
The card divided separate area row punch
They developed device could read information punched card automatically without human help
Because reading error reduced dramatically workflow increased importantly stack punched card could used easily accessible memory almost unlimited size
Furthermore different problem could stored different stack card accessed needed easily transported
Those punched card read electronically card transported brass rod hole card rod made contact electric current could flow
As compared machine computer slow usually processing card per minute card holding decimal number character
At time however punched card huge step forward despite increased population million census tabulated year job might taken year manually
Punched card provided mean memory storage huge scale
For year first use punched card machine first business computing considerable amount computing work science
In Hollerith organized Company promote commercial use machine
year later several company became known International Business Machines IBM
In legendary American inventor Thomas Alva Edison publicly exhibited incandescent electric light bulb first time
Edison employed conducting filament mounted glass bulb air evacuated leaving vacuum
Passing electricity filament caused heat enough become incandescent radiate light vacuum prevented filament oxidizing burning
Edison continued experiment light bulb found could detect electron flowing vacuum lighted filament metal plate mounted inside bulb
This discovery subsequently became known Edison Effect
Edison develop particular finding English physicist John Ambrose Fleming discovered Edison Effect could also used detect radio wave convert electricity
Fleming went develop vacuum tube known
In American inventor Lee de Forest introduced third electrode called grid

II And mankind created computer In assistance two colleague MIT American scientist engineer politician Vannevar Bush designed could solve simple equation
This device Bush dubbed Product Intergraph subsequently built one student
Bush continued develop idea built bigger version called
The Differential Analyzer based use mechanical integrator could interconnected desired manner
To provide amplification Bush employed torque amplifier based principle ship capstan
The final device used integrator torque amplifier drive belt shaft gear measure movement distance dissimilar concept automatic slide rule
Although Bush first Differential Analyzer driven electric motor internal operation purely mechanical
In Bush developed second version gear shifted employed paper tape carry instruction set gear
In age computer constructed size postage stamp difficult visualize scale problem early pioneer faced
To provide sense perspective Bush second Differential Analyzer weighed whopping ton
In addition mechanical element contained vacuum tube thousand relay motor approximately mile wire
As well major achievement right Differential Analyzer also significant focused attention technique therefore detracted investigation development digital solution quite time
Almost anyone spends second working QWERTY keyboard quickly becomes convinced could better job laying key
Many brave soul attempted task came closer efficiency expert August Dvorak
When turned attention typewriter Dvorak spent many tortuous month analyzing usage model QWERTY keyboard
The result investigation although majority user existing layout forced weaker left hand weaker finger hand perform work
Also thanks Sholes main goal physically separating letter commonly typed together typist finger obliged move awkward pattern ended spending time home row
Dvorak took opposite tack Sholes attempted find optimal placement key based letter frequency human anatomy
That tried ensure letter commonly typed together would physically close also usually stronger right hand would perform bulk work left hand would control vowel character
The result labor Dvorak Keyboard patented
Note shift key result Dvorak innovation tremendously effective
Using layout typist finger spend time home row time home key
Thus compared approximately word constructed home row key QWERTY keyboard possible construct word Dvorak home row
Also Dvorak scheme reduces motion hand factor three improves typing accuracy speed approximately respectively
Unfortunately Dvorak really stand chance trying sell typewriter based new keyboard layout
Apart fact existing typist wish trade America heart depression year meant last thing anyone wanted spend money new typewriter
In fact Dvorak keyboard might faded away forever except enthusiast Oregon USA formed club actively promoting Dvorak technique ever since
In George Robert Stibitz scientist Bell Laboratories built digital machine based relay flashlight bulb metal strip cut

Semantics describes process computer follows executing program specific language
This shown describing relationship input output program explanation program execute certain hence creating
Formal semantics instance help write compiler better understand program following statement effect alone
The field formal semantics encompasses following It close link area
There many approach formal semantics belong three major class The distinction three broad class approach sometimes vague known approach formal semantics use technique combination thereof
Apart choice denotational operational axiomatic approach variation formal semantic system arises choice supporting mathematical formalism
Some variation formal semantics include following For variety reason one might wish describe relationship different formal semantics
For example It also possible relate multiple semantics via theory

I keep coming across use word I never understand use meaning conveyed
Phrases like add semantics read semantics semantic web semantically correctly way confuse I referring web
Is word another way say grammar syntax
Thanks
Semantics meaning various element program whatever
For example let look code Both variable integer
From compiler point view exactly
However judging name one width something count thing
Syntactically okay since assign integer
However semantically totally wrong since width number child probably relationship
In case say semantically incorrect even compiler permit
Syntax structure
Semantics meaning
Each different context give different shade meaning term
HTML example new tag meant provide meaning data wrapped tag
The tag conveys data contained within information around
See meaning markup
Take look
Contrast older familiar HTML tag like
Each one affect appearance HTML content rendered browser ca tell u
They contain information meaning
It mean meaning got left already accounted syntax grammar
For example defined grammar valid statement say nothing
Increment one semantics
semantics description supposed put page
Semantic web generally web link search meaning word
The semantically correct way something mean right thing
The word adjective simply mean related word level computer science
For instance Semantic data model data model semantic meaningful understood anyone regardless background expertise
le semantic Java Java us meaningful word class method field
semantics refer tag describe
Check wiki page Very good description
It Computer Science terminology ask What behind Computer Science lingo
I afraid get recursive loop like
In HTML world semantic used talk meaning tag rather considering output look
For example common italicize foreign word also common italicize emphasized word
You could simply wrap foreign emphasized word tag describes look describe look way
A better tag use emphasized word conveys semantics emphasis
The browser stylesheet render italic consumer page know word emphasized
For example could properly read emphasized word
From view almost like looking syntax grammatical way
I ca speak semantics broad term When people talk semantics web normally referring idea stripped away cs javascript etc left bare bone html would make sense read
It also take account using correct tag correct markup
This stem old layout table used tabular data using list present content
You would use something le important
That would make sense

In set rule defines combination symbol considered correctly structured document fragment language
This applies document represents document represents data
The syntax language defines surface form
computer language based sequence character based spatial layout connection symbol may textual graphical
Documents syntactically invalid said
Syntax form contrasted meaning
In processing computer language semantic processing generally come syntactic processing case semantic processing necessary complete syntactic analysis done together
In syntactic analysis comprises semantic analysis comprises middle end phase distinguished
Computer language syntax generally distinguished three level Distinguishing way yield modularity allowing level described processed separately often independently
First lexer turn linear sequence character linear sequence known lexing
Second parser turn linear sequence token hierarchical syntax tree known narrowly speaking
Thirdly contextual analysis resolve name check type
This modularity sometimes possible many language earlier step depends later step example C tokenization depends context
Even case syntactical analysis often seen approximating ideal model
The parsing stage divided two part concrete syntax tree determined grammar generally far detailed practical use AST simplifies usable form
The AST contextual analysis step considered form semantic analysis adding meaning interpretation syntax alternatively informal manual implementation syntactical rule would difficult awkward describe implement formally
The level generally correspond level
Words specified grammar generally given
Phrases CFL generally DCFL specified grammar generally given BNF
Phrase grammar often specified much constrained grammar full order make easier parse parse DCFL linear time simple even simpler efficient parse grammar whose production rule constrained
In principle contextual structure described automatically analyzed mean though general step done manually via rule implemented via store name type scope
Tools written automatically generate lexer lexical specification written regular expression parser phrase grammar written BNF allows one use rather need procedural functional programming
A notable example pair
These automatically produce syntax tree parser writer must manually write code describing converted syntax tree
Contextual analysis also generally implemented manually
Despite existence automatic tool parsing often implemented manually various reason perhaps phrase structure alternative implementation improves performance allows grammar changed easily
Parsers often written functional language Haskell scripting language Python Perl C
As example syntactically valid Lisp program assuming function exists else name resolution fails adding
However following invalid Note lexer unable identify first error know producing token remainder program invalid since word rule begin
The second error detected parsing stage The parser identified list production rule due token match thus give error message general may ambiguous
Type error undeclared variable error sometimes considered syntax error detected usually case compiling language though common classify kind error error instead
As example Python code contains type error add string literal integer literal
Type error kind detected They detected parsing phrase analysis compiler us separate rule allow integerLiteral integerLiteral stringLiteral integerLiteral though likely compiler use parsing rule allows expression form LiteralOrIdentifier LiteralOrIdentifier error detected contextual analysis type checking occurs
In case validation done compiler error detected runtime
In dynamically typed language type determined runtime many type error detected runtime
For example Python code syntactically valid phrase level correctness type b determined runtime variable type Python value
Whereas disagreement whether type error detected compiler called syntax error rather error type error detected program execution time always regarded semantic rather syntax error
The syntax textual programming language usually defined using combination structure structure inductively specify nonterminals symbol
Syntactic category defined rule called specify value belong particular syntactic category
Terminal symbol concrete character string character example syntactically valid program constructed
A language different equivalent grammar equivalent regular expression lexical level different phrase rule generate language
Using broader category grammar LR grammar allow shorter simpler grammar compared restricted category LL grammar may require longer grammar rule
Different equivalent phrase grammar yield different parse tree though underlying language set valid document
Below simple grammar defined using notation regular expression
It describes syntax defines production syntactic category This grammar specifies following Here decimal digit character parenthesis terminal symbol
The following example token sequence grammar The grammar needed specify programming language classified position
The phrase grammar programming language specified using grammar though overall syntax due variable declaration nested scope hence
However exception language phrase grammar
In language like Perl Lisp specification implementation language allows construct execute parsing phase
Furthermore language construct allow programmer alter behavior parser
This combination effectively blur distinction parsing execution make syntax analysis language meaning parsing phase may finish
For example Perl possible execute code parsing using statement Perl function prototype may alter syntactic interpretation possibly even syntactic validity remaining code
Colloquially referred Perl parse Perl code must executed parsing modify grammar strongly even Perl parse Perl undecidable
Similarly Lisp introduced syntax also execute parsing meaning Lisp compiler must entire Lisp system present
In contrast C macro merely string replacement require code execution
The syntax language describes form valid program provide information meaning program result executing program
The meaning given combination symbol handled semantics either
Not syntactically correct program semantically correct
Many syntactically correct program nonetheless per language rule may depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution
In case program may exhibit
Even program within language may still meaning intended person wrote
Using example may possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may false The following C language fragment syntactically correct performs operation semantically defined operation meaning As simpler example syntactically valid semantically defined us
Even though compiler programming language Java C would detect uninitialized variable error kind regarded error rather syntax error
To quickly compare syntax various programming language take look list example

In especially subfield computer language set allowed possible order
The syntax set rule sequence character file must follow considered conforming language
The rule specify character sequence chunked permissible sequence token meaning attributed permissible token sequence additional meaning assigned language
The syntactic analysis source code usually entail transformation linear sequence token hierarchical syntax tree one convenient form syntax tree
This process called
Tools written automatically generate parser specification language grammar written yet another compiler compiler
The syntax computer language often ie
As possible ordering token usually restricted
The analysis program syntax usually performed using automatically generated program known often build

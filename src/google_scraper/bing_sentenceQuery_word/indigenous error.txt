Indigenous Knowledge become accepted term include belief understanding people acquired association place
It knowledge based social physical spiritual understanding informed people survival contributed sense world
Indigenous Knowledge go many different name Traditional Ecological Knowledge TEK Indigenous People Knowledge IPK even folk knowledge
While Indigenous knowledge sometimes contrast scientific knowledge also complementary provide supplementary information world
Science Western science system knowledge relies certain law established application scientific method phenomenon world around u
The process scientific method begin observation followed prediction hypothesis tested
Depending test result hypothesis become scientific theory truth world
The history development Western science demonstrates developed Europe particular last year
Its truth relates certain value idea necessarily objective
Although scientist may admit many way understanding natural world believe science best way testable knowledge
Indigenous science science Indigenous people developed independent Western science
If understand indigenous relate people complex relationship local area science mean systematic approach acquiring knowledge natural world Indigenous science process Indigenous people build empirical knowledge natural environment
As case Western science Indigenous science practical application theory knowledge nature world increasingly Indigenous people incorporating Western scientific knowledge practice
Scientists generally distinguish scientific knowledge Indigenous Knowledge claiming science universal whereas Indigenous Knowledge relates particular people understanding world
There occasion science take board aspect Indigenous knowledge meet criterion western science
Generally however Indigenous Knowledge fit criterion science therefore classed different kind knowledge
There two main reason include Indigenous Knowledge science curriculum firstly introducing student concept Indigenous Knowledge science education increased awareness Aboriginal culture identity secondly modern day environmental problem social cultural dimension benefit perspective Western science
While scientific knowledge needed solve problem science alone often sufficient Indigenous Knowledge may make useful contribution
Although education policy Australian state territory require teaching Indigenous perspective within broad range curriculum including science seems curriculum content teaching method resource focussed Western scientific view Aboriginal cultural knowledge
In science education educator treated concept Indigenous Knowledge another body ecological knowledge divisible category correspond neatly scientific category
Taking example fire knowledge science educator concentrated people knowledge create fire well knowledge season fire behaviour
However approach denies cultural significance fire knowledge also denies opportunity significant learning

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
There different type error prevent computer program working way
Three key error type
Runtime error error cause program computer crash even appears nothing wrong program code
Running often cause runtime error
This could written wrong order
Syntax error mistake way code written
program syntactically correct
Common syntax error include spelling mistake incorrect use punctuation use capital letter
This piece code designed add two number together display result There four syntax error
Can identify
The syntax error The syntactically correct code would Semantic error logical error program work produce different result designed expected
A program semantic error without error reported
This code contains semantic error
The program run obvious problem see output result
The first two line ask user suggest number value
However function return data type
If user give value first second number stored string
When add two string together eg answer
Adding together produce answer
If try program valid program error work first time
However would notice unexpected result
The correct code would require value set
However integer need output string along rest outputted message
The correct code Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

As programming naturally encounter lot error
Causing understanding fixing error important part programming
Python best run anything tell run ca understand asking wo run program
All Python try tell little bit information went wrong order help try fix
Here two Python error
In first example forget use parenthesis required
Python understand trying
Here second example bug Python
In second example forget define variable
Python know want since defined error occurs
A happens Python ca understand saying
A happens Python understands saying run trouble following instruction
In English would like sentence The grammar sentence make sense
From perspective English grammar missing action
You understand asked
mean thing
In English would like sentence The sentence make sense grammatical perspective verb noun right place know asked
But encounter problem start trying eat piano except maybe termite
This called occurs program start running
We also talk end mean program run without crashing still produce wrong result
An example would This would logic error also open even though command make sense close back door actually accomplish goal keeping bug since still come front door
Here additional example syntax error occur Python
One general thing occur Python encounter special symbol place expect
Python say point exclamation point
The problem meaning Python
The syntax error would go away put instead Python would understand part text
Here another syntax error subtle
The problem special word Python
written instead class would fine
Click see list special keywords Python
If using quote around text forget second one using parenthesis forget second one get syntax error In error short nd f ine Python expected another line ended found
Similarly short nd f ile Python kept looking program file ended found
Sometimes two similar syntax error give two different error message
But every error message indeed trying tell something helpful
Here common error
Python able understand program say run problem actually performing instruction
You find way producing error learn Python
Your program might run without crashing syntax error still wrong thing
For example perhaps want program calculate two number average defined Why program work
The average program print instead
The error time order operation arithmetic
When write mathematical meaning
To fix problem third line program written make clear Python really want value add first divide afterwards
You logic error program incorrectly write code follows design correctly like example
Logic error difficult spot especially longer program get better writing code also get better avoiding logic error
Lesson give tip avoiding logic error
Now lesson complete three exercise fixing error program
You try spot error running program run first use Python response determine need fixing
Once squashed bug move next lesson

African Indigenous Knowledge Systems Professor Gloria Emeagwali Introduction There intersection mainstream science IK
At core mainstream science desire negotiate nature sequential process hypothesis formulation experiment prediction
The process discovery may intuitive accidental conjectural inspirational outcome generally predictable repeatable although scholar argue general thrust mainstream science explain regularity deliberately exclude unique intractable
Knowledge production mainstream science includes phase experimentation trial error otherwise
But area well IK discovery experimentation mode transmission sharing often collective rather individualistic
Embedded product service associated IK proprietary system often flexible negotiable western counterpart case others
The engine growth sustenance neither market profit mainstream science
IK seems relatively le transferable conventional science given holistic even spiritual dimension
IK appears largely communitarian term motive prone mass production economy scale
IKS provides excellent example community based community biased research
Its weakness lie close reliance dependence demographic stability morality
The community source strength IK term discovery process knowledge production
For methodological pluralist Paul Feyerabend implication IK science function
For theorist believe concept single science IK may probably construed scientific light common feature associated enterprise
One perspective suggests IK integrated mainstream whilst another implies IK science separate mainstream equal
Resolving theoretical conceptual issue identity African Indigenous Knowledge Systems AIK fact one many challenge confronting African philosopher historian anthropologist educator
There numerous theoretical methodological puzzle would best resolved structured discussion within institutional framework context planned curriculum formalized discourse
European philosopher science Popper Lakatos Kuhn Feyerabend spent inordinate amount time discussing nature rationality objectivity problem solving mainstream science
We need AIK rejecting accepting modifying adapting relevant conceptual baggage field creating entirely new construct analysis understanding phenomenon necessary
The need inclusion AIK curriculum go beyond issue however matter significant latter objective may
There psychological intellectual economic reason basically stem mode evolution historical process continent well structure intellectual dominance dependence associated colonial postcolonial hierarchy power elite
We elsewhere identified several strategy disinformation embedded eurocentric colonial education including selective omission European achievement invention technology distortion data surreptitious naming several strategy colonization recolonization
The recognition appreciation IKS source healing therapeutic import context unhealthy imbalance distortion trivialization neglect inflicted eurocentric education governance
Tapping intellectual resource associated IK cost effective also relevant indispensable environmentally ecologically sensitive activity
It level economic sustainability cost effectiveness however AIK continues prove viability strength
The vibrant sector African economy present time informal sector sometimes referred second economy
In case total economic growth take place arena producer manufacturer banker
Specialists technical operative include metallurgist textile manufacturer food processor
The interesting issue many agent agency associated second economy tap accumulated skill expertise indigenous knowledge system traditional Africa
The fact Africa century afflicted major externally derived economic model exploitation namely colonial model exploitation model aimed recolonization
The economic epistemological knowledge oriented aspect model aimed exploitation
Built model negative unwholesome presupposition race gender segregationist policy discriminatory mode allocation space resource infrastructure prevailed
oriented growth monoculture program export first stage mineral agricultural extraction dominant trend part continent
The survival informal sector took place odds
Its survival testimony strong capacity resilience growth AIK invariably persists level material culture natural environment also field business management banking hospitality service
Jeffrey Fadiman point Africa Black Market African business method include centered approach place people product
In reversal western business strategy personal relationship precede product presentation
He identifies indigenous management strategy result indigenous commercial value system ethic several millennium
Fadiman text geared business traveler West excellent springboard research IK level management business administration
The entrenchment within curriculum educational milieu structure critical evaluation understanding revitalization AIK must necessarily important challenge century policy maker educator
The end result could consolidation network local researcher democratically engaged research compatible community value aspiration goal
It could also establish pathway towards consolidation democratic form knowledge production done within framework openness empathetic critical research
Research matter context would also include discussion intellectual property right nature compensation indigenous knowledge worker expert
At moment institutional science taught context eurocentric paradigm carry along disdain disrespect arrogance
It hoped respect humility openness would value permeating new curriculum
The Curriculum AIK Whether one view curriculum academic plan map sequence step reality theoretically speaking various model choose
We shall discus two reflect implication teaching learning strategy content evaluation anticipated outcome respect Africa IK
The two selected model model constitute possible approach curriculum seem amongst dominant
The first model implies knowledge consists independent body fact assimilated transmitted good teacher mean thorough coverage specific textbook
Students effectively assessed occasional exam may objective test essay
This particular model generally centered instructor major actor learning process
The content generally logically arranged sequence unit
Educational content may identified specific discipline centered based model
It quite feasible though variation model utilize student centered learning strategy within context core area study
Use Library Media Center may relatively restricted approach given emphasis one two textbook identified teacher exemplary
To teach AIK classroom environment entail discovery one two outstanding text would incorporated identified core area
At worst textbook eurocentric place entire enterprise risk insinuation ridicule negative representation aimed perpetuating eurocentric superiority triumphalism
In case teacher student may hostage text
At best however student emerges informed although necessarily critically aware societal impropriety prevailing power relation
In case critically engaged model however focus socially oriented
Students encouraged trained challenge existing relation power domination term transformative epistemology
Awareness societal ill local global level preoccupies discourse curriculum viewed instrument empowerment
Consciousness raising development social awareness become part mission curriculum curriculum planning
With model use library medium center extensive
Learning teaching strategy decisively student centered
There greater range methodological experimentation willingness utilize student centered resource
This model also aim developing mind intellect context rigorous intellectual activity research
Its implication indigenous knowledge manifested affective cognitive methodological approach including experimental use instructional resource
There keen awareness knowledge production socially derived relation domination oppression could affect content
Evaluation context approach associated objective test like rather measuring attitude social consciousness pointed Susan Toohey sometimes negotiable dialogue
For first approach AIK may structured along line conventional discipline
In second decidedly problem approach undertaken
The concept praxis prominent item agenda community based project
For first model structure knowledge logical
For basis social
Oral Tradition AIK The significant information gathering exercise AIK Oral Tradition namely collective testimony recollection past inherited earlier generation transmitted various form verbal testimony
Orally transmitted information inherited past generation may shared structured unstructured context
It constitutes major resource classified many different scholar
Vansina thoughtful classification still handy
His five category Oral Tradition include formula embedded slogan ceremonial spiritually derived language poetry leadership list reigning monarch narrative tale commentary
Narratives may historical instructive artistic personal commentary legal
Needless say type Yoruba poetry identified one researcher including poetry wedding ceremony relaxation entertainment funeral well known personality poetry wisdom IFA
The relevant kind poetry indigenous knowledge research kind emphasized paper seems praise poem poetic invocation traditional healing poetry expressing deep thought philosophy
To tap resource associated Akan Oral Tradition one must understand identify various specialist associated enterprise minstrel master ceremony royal drummer royal horn blower spokesman king funerary priest king king carrier female soul bearer master ceremony divinity various court functionary administrator
There important ground rule researcher indigenous knowledge system utilize Oral Tradition
At preliminary stage researcher must fully sensitive status provider information stake system various version traditional explanation given
Preliminary question asked ethnic identity group community associated orally shared information
There clear understanding whether orally transmitted information myth legend proverb chant praise song unidentified unidentifiable origin
The researcher determine whether information relevance researching genealogy tradition origin migration pattern settlement pattern biography spiritual religious trend medical technique food processing textile building botanical methodology general lifestyle otherwise
Particular attention must placed specific reference natural disaster eclipse contemporaneous event
Ambivalent concept must identified distortion translation process
Gender racial private bias must recognized extent bias associated community presenter translator oral document
The nature transmission document significant court historian tend interpret differently unofficial griot institution specialized training school
If data associated collective memory one aware
Instructional Resources AIK No longer library primarily depository book librarian mainly caretaker custodian
The profession stage great transformation
According Carol Kearney librarian old transformed curriculum planner medium specialist significant use wide range resource computer generated program wide range internet derived resource including virtual museum virtual laboratory even virtual library
Audiotapes retain appeal conventional resource
Given importance Oral Tradition research methodology information gathering audio tape probably remains important resource
It cheaper le intimidating camcorder newer technology concept depositing finished tape library medium center difficult implement sustain
The onus African Indigenous Knowledge Center extensively document late variety accumulated experience African region near far obscure obvious
Colonial espionage provided series anthropologically based intelligence report
The newly independent state Africa must engage exercise right reason collaborate predecessor construction database type
This must done context knowledge accumulation consolidation problem solving community enrichment
The role library medium center curriculum planning related instructional material also teaching learning strategy discussion debate symposium interview tutorial
The participatory atmosphere generated activity quite compatible spirit content IK
A fundamental assumption classroom teacher various level must collaborate Library Media Center identifying need devising instructional content providing learning experience
In fact Urbank see teamwork two professional term three possibility namely teacher planned approach librarian planned approach unified team approach
In ideal situation library consultant aware teaching goal content taught teaching learning strategy implemented
It obvious librarian must therefore generously rewarded given appropriate financial incentive
In current era IMF World Bank structural adjustment imposition debt repayment serious financial constraint
We aware also impact program funding educational institution library system therefore search excellence also search affordable resource whether level instruction resource management
Because AIK research largely community based major investment enterprise well health survival valuable resource people
This current AIDS pandemic tragic
On positive note though observe indigenous system knowledge production facilitated discovery healing property African willow South Africa hoodia plant Namibia iboga Gabon Cameroon botanical revolutionize Western medical establishment term cancer treatment dietary care therapy respectively
In case potential cancer cure principle stake interruption flow blood cancer patient healthy tissue
The traditional doctor brought herbal caffrum attention Bob Pettit Arizona State University use herbal cancer treatment certainly aware scientific significance health care
It inconceivable benign cure AIDS could emerge resource base AIK
If AIDS exist must something killing people large number entity whatever name must destroyed
If AIDS product biological warfare genetic engineering deliberately infected monkey wild challenge greater u researcher educator scientist healer
Burying one head sand ward disaster credible strategy coping tragedy
Curriculum planning must always take consideration existing power relation multiple center power involved process implementation

In signal emitted hardware software indicating event need immediate attention
An interrupt alert processor condition requiring interruption current code processor executing
The processor responds suspending current activity saving executing called interrupt service routine ISR deal event
This interruption temporary interrupt handler finish processor resume normal activity
There two type interrupt hardware interrupt software interrupt
used device communicate require attention
Internally hardware interrupt implemented using electronic alerting signal sent processor external device either part computer external
For example pressing key moving trigger hardware interrupt cause processor read keystroke mouse position
Unlike software type described hardware interrupt occur middle instruction execution requiring additional care programming
The act initiating hardware interrupt referred IRQ
A caused either exceptional condition processor special cause interrupt executed
The former often called used error event occurring program execution exceptional enough handled within program
For example exception thrown processor commanded divide number zero instruction error impossible
The operating system catch exception choose abort instruction
Software interrupt instruction function similarly used variety purpose request service like interrupt sent request reading writing data disk
Each interrupt interrupt handler
The number hardware interrupt limited number interrupt request IRQ line processor may hundred different software interrupt
Interrupts commonly used technique especially
Such system said
Interrupts similar difference signal used mediated kernel possibly via system call handled process interrupt mediated processor handled
The kernel may pas interrupt signal process caused typical example
Hardware interrupt introduced optimization eliminating unproductive waiting time waiting external event
They may implemented hardware distinct system control line may integrated memory subsystem
If implemented hardware interrupt controller circuit IBM PC PIC may connected interrupting device processor interrupt pin several source interrupt onto one two CPU line typically available
If implemented part interrupt mapped system memory
Interrupts categorized different type Processors typically internal allows software ignore external hardware interrupt set
Setting clearing mask may faster accessing interrupt mask register IMR PIC disabling interrupt device
In case architecture disabling enabling interrupt processor act however may actually slower
An interrupt leaf machine state called
Such interrupt four property An interrupt meet requirement called
The phenomenon overall system performance severely hindered excessive amount processing time spent handling interrupt called
A interrupt signaled maintaining interrupt line high low
A device wishing signal interrupt drive line active level high low hold level serviced
It cease asserting line CPU command otherwise handle condition caused signal interrupt
Typically processor sample interrupt input predefined time bus cycle state microprocessor
If interrupt active processor sample CPU see
One possible use type interrupt minimize spurious signal noisy interrupt line spurious pulse often short noticed
Multiple device may share interrupt line designed
The interrupt line must actively driven settle inactive state
Devices actively assert line indicate outstanding interrupt let line float actively drive signalling interrupt
The line asserted state one one sharing device signalling outstanding interrupt
interrupt favored easy share line without losing interrupt multiple shared device interrupt time
Upon detecting assertion interrupt line CPU must search device sharing line one triggered interrupt detected
After servicing device CPU may recheck interrupt line status determine whether device also need service
If line CPU avoids checking remaining device line
Since device interrupt frequently others device interrupt particularly expensive careful ordering device check employed increase efficiency
The original standard mandated interrupt advantage sharing interrupt
There also serious problem sharing interrupt
As long device line outstanding request service line remains asserted possible detect change status device
Deferring servicing device option would prevent detection service request device
If device line CPU know service interrupt device permanently block interrupt device
An interrupt signalled interrupt line either falling edge high low rising edge low high
A device wishing signal interrupt drive pulse onto line release line inactive state
If pulse short detected special hardware may required detect edge
Multiple device may share interrupt line designed
The interrupt line must resistor actively driven settle one particular state
Devices signal interrupt briefly driving line state let line float actively drive signalling interrupt
This type connection also referred
The line carry pulse generated device
This analogous bus trolley passenger pull signal driver requesting stop
However interrupt pulse different device may merge occur close time
To avoid losing interrupt CPU must trigger trailing edge pulse
rising edge line pulled driven low
After detecting interrupt CPU must check device service requirement
interrupt suffer problem interrupt sharing
Service device postponed arbitrarily interrupt continue received device serviced
If device CPU know service may cause spurious interrupt even periodic spurious interrupt interfere interrupt signalling device
However fairly easy edge triggered interrupt missed example interrupt masked period unless type hardware latch record event impossible recover
Such problem caused many lockup early computer hardware processor know expected something
More modern hardware often one interrupt status register latch interrupt request well written interrupt software often check register ensure event missed
The elderly ISA bus us interrupt mandate device able share
The also us interrupt
Many older device assume exclusive use interrupt line making electrically unsafe share
However ISA motherboards include resistor IRQ line device share ISA interrupt fine
Some system use hybrid signalling
The hardware look edge also verifies interrupt signal stay active certain period time
A common use hybrid interrupt NMI interrupt input
Because NMIs generally signal major even catastrophic system event good implementation signal try ensure interrupt valid verifying remains active period time
This approach help eliminate false interrupt affecting system
A use physical interrupt line
Instead device signal request service sending short message communication medium typically
The message might type reserved interrupt might type memory write
interrupt behave much like interrupt interrupt momentary signal rather continuous condition
software treat two much manner
Typically multiple pending interrupt message virtual interrupt line allowed merge closely spaced interrupt merge
shared extent underlying communication medium shared
No additional effort required
Because identity interrupt indicated pattern data bit requiring separate physical conductor many distinct interrupt efficiently handled
This reduces need sharing
Interrupt message also passed serial bus requiring additional line
serial computer bus us exclusively
In analogy applied term often used describe mechanism whereby system signal notify device work done
Typically software system place data mutually agreed upon memory location ring doorbell writing different memory location
This different memory location often called doorbell region may even multiple doorbell serving different purpose region
It act writing doorbell region memory ring bell notifies hardware device data ready waiting
The hardware device would know data valid acted upon
It would typically write data send etc
The term usually
It similar interrupt cause work done device however doorbell region sometimes implemented region sometimes doorbell region writes physical device sometimes doorbell region hardwired directly physical device register
When either writing directly physical device register may cause real interrupt occur device central processor unit one
Doorbell interrupt compared similarity
Multiple device sharing interrupt line triggering style act spurious interrupt source respect
With many device one line workload servicing interrupt grows proportion square number device
It therefore preferred spread device evenly across available interrupt line
Shortage interrupt line problem older system design interrupt line distinct physical conductor
interrupt interrupt line virtual favored new system architecture relieve problem considerable extent
Some device poorly designed programming interface provide way determine whether requested service
They may lock otherwise misbehave serviced want
Such device tolerate spurious interrupt also tolerate sharing interrupt line
card due often cheap design construction notorious problem
Such device becoming much rarer becomes cheaper new system architecture mandate shareable interrupt
Interrupts provide low overhead good low load degrade significantly high interrupt rate unless care taken prevent several pathology
These various form system spends time processing interrupt exclusion required task
Under extreme condition large number interrupt like high network traffic may completely stall system
To avoid problem must schedule network interrupt handling carefully schedule process execution
With processor additional performance improvement interrupt handling achieved RSS used
Such NICs provide multiple receive associated separate interrupt routing interrupt different core processing interrupt request triggered network traffic received single NIC distributed among multiple core
Distribution interrupt among core performed automatically operating system routing interrupt usually referred manually configured
A purely implementation receiving traffic distribution known RPS distributes received traffic among core later data path part functionality
Advantages RPS RSS include requirement specific hardware advanced traffic distribution filter reduced rate interrupt produced NIC
As downside RPS increase rate IPIs
RFS take approach accounting performance improvement achieved processing interrupt request core particular network packet consumed targeted application
Typical us interrupt include following system timer disk signal
Other interrupt exist transfer data byte using sense control motor anything else equipment must
Another typical use generate periodic interrupt dividing output crystal oscillator interrupt handler count interrupt order processor keep time
These periodic interrupt often used OS task reschedule priority running
Some older computer generated periodic interrupt controlled utility eliminate drift electric clock
For example disk interrupt signal completion data transfer disk peripheral process waiting read write file start
As another example interrupt predicts request loss power allowing computer equipment perform orderly
Also interrupt used feature buffering event like
Interrupts used allow emulation instruction unimplemented certain model computer line
For example instruction may implemented hardware system emulated system
Execution unimplemented instruction cause interrupt
The operating system interrupt handler recognize occurrence unimplemented instruction interpret instruction software routine return interrupting program instruction executed
This provides application software portability across entire line

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Can running interrupt handler another interrupt handler
If possible scenario safe scenario
If possible
This depends processor architecture kernel architecture
Generally speaking interrupt handler start interrupt disabled
This necessary interrupt handler room storage minimum interrupt handler need exclusive use register including program counter processor must save somewhere set banked register
On processor possible interrupt interrupted another interrupt
To give one example I familiar ARM processor IRQ normal interrupt FIQ fast interrupt
Each register bank program counter stack pointer interrupt vector
An IRQ handler start IRQ disabled FIQ enabled FIQ handler start IRQ FIQ disabled
Thus FIQ triggered middle handling IRQ
It operating system decide interrupt handler reenable interrupt priority interrupt different type priority
The longer interrupt blocked longer latency handle interrupt come soon another
In particular OS typically need reenable interrupt fast
To give couple example At point interrupt handler unmasks interrupt must ready cope must using resource another interrupt handler would thrash
Furthermore since interrupt handler finished job must mechanism program counter saved somewhere mechanic depends lot processor kernel architecture

I trying understand interrupt latency linux dependent kernel tick timer
Interrupt latency time elapses interrupt generated source code interrupt handled
I followed explanation Which relate mechanism clock tick
Is therefore correct say interrupt latency dependent timer tick
higher tick value result smaller interrupt latency
Interrupt latency measure time take handle single interrupt device
It made multiple component primarily The last one particular variable measure interrupt latency usually include minimum typical maximum value
The primary component interrupt latency given influenced frequently interrupt handler run however may effect The specific example clock used LDD chapter cited may relevant However I read LDD chapter question refers simply using clock tick example interrupt source
So general value affect interrupt latency although measure would probably probably small effect

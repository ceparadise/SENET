In computer science computer program directly executes
instruction written programming scripting language without previously compiling machine language program
An interpreter generally us one following strategy program execution parse source code perform behavior directly
translate source code efficient intermediate representation immediately execute
explicitly execute stored precompiled code made compiler part interpreter system
Early version Lisp programming language Dartmouth BASIC would example first type
Perl Python MATLAB Ruby example second UCSD Pascal example third type
Source program compiled ahead time stored machine independent code linked executed interpreter compiler JIT system
Some system Smalltalk contemporary version BASIC Java may also combine two three
Interpreters various type also constructed many language traditionally associated compilation Algol Fortran Cobol
While interpretation compilation two main mean programming language implemented mutually exclusive interpreting system also perform translation work like compiler
The term interpreted language compiled language signify canonical implementation language interpreter compiler respectively
A high level language ideally abstraction independent particular implementation
The first interpreted language Lisp
Lisp first implemented Steve Russell IBM computer
Russell read John McCarthy paper realized McCarthy surprise Lisp function could implemented machine code
The result working Lisp interpreter could used run Lisp program properly evaluate Lisp expression
Compilers versus interpreter Programs written high level language either directly executed kind interpreter converted machine code compiler assembler linker CPU execute
While compiler assembler generally produce machine code directly executable computer hardware often optionally produce intermediate form called object code
This basically machine specific code augmented symbol table name tag make executable block module identifiable relocatable
Compiled program typically use building block function kept library object code module
A linker used combine library file object file application form single executable file
The object file used generate executable file thus often produced different time sometimes even different language capable generating object format
A simple interpreter written low level language
assembly may similar machine code block implementing function high level language stored executed function entry look table point code
However interpreter written high level language typically us another approach generating walking parse tree generating executing intermediate instruction
Thus compiler interpreter generally turn source code text file token may may generate parse tree may generate immediate instruction stack machine quadruple code mean
The basic difference compiler system including built separate linker generates program interpreter system instead action described high level program
A compiler thus make almost conversion source code semantics machine level
program changed interpreter conversion work every time statement function executed
However efficient interpreter much translation work including analysis type similar factored done first time program module function even statement run thus quite akin compiler work
However compiled program still run much faster circumstance part compiler designed optimize code may given ample time
This especially true simpler high level language without many dynamic data structure check
In traditional compilation executable output linkers file file library see picture typically relocatable run general operating system much like object code module difference relocation done dynamically run time
program loaded execution
On hand compiled linked program small embedded system typically statically allocated often hard coded NOR flash memory often secondary storage operating system sense
Historically editor built
This becoming common also compiler often called IDE although programmer prefer use editor choice run compiler linker tool manually
Historically compiler predate interpreter hardware time could support interpreter interpreted code typical batch environment time limited advantage interpretation
Development cycle During software development cycle programmer make frequent change source code
When using compiler time change made source code must wait compiler translate altered source file link binary code file together program executed
The larger program longer wait
By contrast programmer using interpreter lot le waiting interpreter usually need translate code worked intermediate representation translate thus requiring much le time change tested
Effects evident upon saving source code reloading program
Compiled code generally le readily debugged editing compiling linking sequential process conducted proper sequence proper set command
For reason many compiler also executive aid known Make file program
The Make file list compiler linker command line program source code file might take simple command line menu input
Make selects third group set instruction issue command compiler linker feeding specified source code file
Distribution A compiler convert source code binary instruction specific processor architecture thus making le portable
This conversion made developer environment binary distributed user machine executed without translation
A cross compiler generate binary code user machine even different processor machine code compiled
An interpreted program distributed source code
It need translated final machine take time make program distribution independent machine architecture
However portability interpreted source code dependent target machine actually suitable interpreter
If interpreter need supplied along source overall installation process complex delivery monolithic executable since interpreter part need installed
The fact interpreted code easily read copied human concern point view copyright
However various system encryption obfuscation exist
Delivery intermediate code bytecode similar effect obfuscation bytecode could decoded decompiler disassembler
Efficiency The main disadvantage interpreter interpreted program typically run slower compiled
The difference speed could tiny great often order magnitude sometimes
It generally take longer run program interpreter run compiled code take le time interpret total time required compile run
This especially important prototyping testing code cycle often much shorter cycle
Interpreting code slower running compiled code interpreter must analyze statement program time executed perform desired action whereas compiled code performs action within fixed context determined compilation
This analysis known interpretive overhead
Access variable also slower interpreter mapping identifier storage location must done repeatedly rather compile time
There various compromise development speed using interpreter execution speed using compiler
Some system Lisps allow interpreted compiled code call share variable
This mean routine tested debugged interpreter compiled thus benefit faster execution routine developed
Many interpreter execute source code stand convert compact internal form
Many BASIC interpreter replace keywords single byte token used find instruction jump table
A interpreter PBASIC interpreter achieve even higher level program compaction using rather program memory structure command token occupy perhaps bit nominally constant stored code requiring bit address operand include bit offset
Many BASIC interpreter store read back tokenized internal representation
wikitable collapsible collapsed right left
Toy C expression interpreter An interpreter might well use lexical analyzer parser compiler interpret resulting abstract syntax tree
Example data type definition latter toy interpreter syntax tree obtained C expression shown box
Regression Interpretation used sole method execution even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack code interpreted definition machine code CPU execute
Variations Bytecode interpreter There spectrum possibility interpreting compiling depending amount analysis performed program executed
For example Emacs Lisp compiled bytecode highly compressed optimized representation Lisp source machine code therefore tied particular hardware
This compiled code interpreted bytecode interpreter written C
The compiled code case machine code virtual machine implemented hardware bytecode interpreter
Such compiling interpreter sometimes also called
In byte code interpreter instruction start byte therefore byte code interpreter instruction although may used
Some byte code may take multiple byte may arbitrarily complicated
Control table necessarily ever need pas compiling phase dictate appropriate algorithmic control flow via customized interpreter similar fashion bytecode interpreter
Threaded code interpreter Threaded code interpreter similar byte code interpreter instead byte use pointer
Each instruction word point function instruction sequence possibly followed parameter
The threaded code interpreter either loop fetching instruction calling function point fetch first instruction jump every instruction sequence end fetch jump next instruction
Unlike byte code effective limit number different instruction available memory address space
The classic example threaded code Forth code used Open Firmware system source language compiled F code bytecode interpreted virtual machine
Abstract Syntax Tree interpreter In spectrum interpreting compiling another approach transform source code optimized abstract syntax tree AST execute program following tree structure use generate native code
In approach sentence need parsed
As advantage bytecode AST keep global program structure relation statement lost bytecode representation compressed provides compact representation
Thus using AST proposed better intermediate format compiler bytecode
Also allows system perform better analysis runtime
However interpreter AST cause overhead bytecode interpreter node related syntax performing useful work le sequential representation requiring traversal pointer overhead visiting tree
compilation Further blurring distinction interpreter interpreter compilation compilation JIT technique intermediate representation compiled native machine code runtime
This confers efficiency running native code cost startup time increased memory use bytecode AST first compiled
Adaptive optimization complementary technique interpreter profile running program compiles frequently executed part native code
Both technique decade old appearing language Smalltalk
compilation gained mainstream attention amongst language implementers recent year Java Framework modern JavaScript implementation Matlab including JITs
A programming language interpreter written programming language interpret example BASIC interpreter written BASIC
related compiler
If compiler exists language interpreted creating requires implementation language host language may another programming language assembler
By first interpreter system bootstrapped new version interpreter developed language
It way Donald Knuth developed TANGLE interpreter language WEB industrial standard TeX typesetting system
Defining computer language usually done relation abstract machine operational semantics mathematical function denotational semantics
A language may also defined interpreter semantics host language given
The definition language define language tell reader expressiveness elegance language
It also enables interpreter interpret source code first step towards reflective interpreting
An important design dimension implementation whether feature interpreted language implemented feature interpreter host language
An example whether closure language implemented using closure interpreter language implemented manually data structure explicitly storing environment
The feature implemented feature host language le control programmer interpreter different behavior dealing number overflow realized arithmetic operation delegated corresponding operation host language
Some language elegant Lisp Prolog
Much research particularly reflective interpreter conducted Scheme programming language dialect Lisp
In general however language allows writing interpreter
Lisp language Lisp program list symbol list
XSLT language XSLT program written XML
A writing language DSLs
Clive Gifford introduced measure quality eigenratio limit ratio computer time spent running stack time spent run stack go infinity
This value depend program run
The book present example interpretation Scheme dialect
Other example language Forth Pascal
Applications Interpreters frequently used execute command language glue language since operator executed command language usually invocation complex routine editor compiler
code easily implemented interpreted language
This relates origin interpretation Lisp artificial intelligence research
Virtualization
Machine code intended hardware architecture run using virtual machine
This often used intended architecture unavailable among us running multiple copy
Sandboxing While type sandbox rely operating system protection interpreter virtual machine often used
The actual hardware architecture originally intended hardware architecture may may
This may seem pointless except sandbox compelled actually execute instruction source code processing
In particular refuse execute code violates security constraint operating

involved
If special form like evaluate anything simply pas argument expression along environment function handle form
If normal call evaluate operator verify function call result evaluating argument
We use plain JavaScript function value represent Egg function value
We come back later special form called fun defined
The recursive structure evaluate resembles similar structure parser
Both mirror structure language
It would also possible integrate parser evaluator evaluate parsing splitting way make program readable
This really needed interpret Egg
It simple
But without defining special form adding useful value environment anything language yet
Special form The specialForms object used define special syntax Egg
It associate word function evaluate special form
It currently empty
Let add form
specialForms function args env args
length throw new SyntaxError Bad number args evaluate args env false return evaluate args env else return evaluate args env Egg construct expects exactly three argument
It evaluate first result value false evaluate second
Otherwise third get evaluated
This form similar JavaScript ternary
operator JavaScript
It expression statement produce value namely result second third argument
Egg differs JavaScript handle condition value
It treat thing like zero empty string false precise value false
The reason need represent special form rather regular function argument function evaluated function called whereas evaluate either second third argument depending value first
The form similar
specialForms function args env args
length throw new SyntaxError Bad number args evaluate args env false evaluate args env Since undefined exist Egg return false lack meaningful result
return false Another basic building block executes argument top bottom
Its value value produced last argument
specialForms function args env var value false args
forEach function arg value evaluate arg env return value To able create variable give new value also create form called define
It expects word first argument expression producing value assign word second argument
Since define like everything expression must return value
We make return value assigned like JavaScript operator
specialForms define function args env args
length args
type word throw new SyntaxError Bad use define var value evaluate args env env args

The wikipedia article primitive recursion mention primitive recursive function ca compute function ev j computes th primitive recursive function input j
I wondering compute primitive recursion equipped ev I refer secondary recursive function
More formally Note ev still computing primitive recursion
Thus secondary recursion always halt ev always halt way building secondary recursive function ca turn halting function function
I found nice example function secondary recursive
For example fixed n function b b primitive recursive
Given arbitrary n compute index work use ev compute arrow b n b primitive recursive used compute Ackermann function
We also generalize n recursion recursion primitive recursion recursion primitive recursion equipped function evaluates n recursive function
Then generalize even recursive function union n recursive function n recursion primitive recursion equipped function evaluates recursion etc
I question Have studied
Do name
Are nice example function recursive secondary recursive
A paper Sylvain Schmitz seems tackle similar question
While necessarily defining exact class I read paper discus class function primitive recursive recursive well elementary primitive recursive

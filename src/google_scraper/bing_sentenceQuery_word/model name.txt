In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software
formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation made representative ACM IEEE CS four area considers crucial discipline computer science
In addition four area CSAB also identifies field software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation important area computer science

Programming language theory branch computer science deal design implementation analysis characterization classification individual
It fall within discipline computer science depending affecting software engineering
It active research area numerous dedicated academic journal
Formal method particular kind based technique development software system
The use formal method software hardware design motivated expectation engineering discipline performing appropriate mathematical analysis contribute reliability robustness design
They form important theoretical underpinning software engineering especially safety security involved
Formal method useful adjunct software testing since help avoid error also give framework testing
For industrial use tool support required
However high cost using formal method mean usually used development safety utmost importance
Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Computer architecture digital computer organization conceptual design fundamental operational structure computer system
It focus largely way central processing unit performs internally access address memory
The field often involves discipline computer engineering electrical engineering selecting interconnecting hardware component create computer meet functional performance cost goal
Computer performance analysis study work flowing computer general goal improving controlling using resource efficiently eliminating predicting performance anticipated peak load
Concurrency property system several computation executing simultaneously potentially interacting
A number mathematical model developed general concurrent computation including model
A distributed system extends idea concurrency onto multiple computer connected network
Computers within distributed system private memory information often exchanged among achieve common goal
This branch computer science aim manage network computer worldwide
Computer security branch computer technology whose objective includes protection information unauthorized access disruption modification maintaining accessibility usability system intended user
Cryptography practice study hiding encryption therefore deciphering decryption information
Modern cryptography largely related computer science many encryption decryption algorithm based computational complexity
A database intended organize store retrieve large amount data easily
Digital database managed using database management system store create maintain search data
Computer graphic study digital visual content involves synthesis manipulation image data
The study connected many field computer science including heavily applied field special effect

AI associated popular mind main field practical application embedded component area require computational understanding
The late question Can computer think
question remains effectively unanswered although still used ass computer output scale human intelligence
But automation evaluative predictive task increasingly successful substitute human monitoring intervention domain computer application involving complex data
Software engineering study designing implementing modifying software order ensure high quality affordable maintainable fast build
It systematic approach software design involving application engineering practice software
Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I new machine learning
But basic understanding concept
Problem statement We human wo perceive much difference Tim Cook Tim
replaced zero
I trying model
Task model predict two name visually similar
The system configured predefined set name
When system online predict whether given name similar one configured name similar configured name
My current approach I trying come model
First stage binary classier predicts name know system
Second stage classifier tell configured name given name similar
Features Using string distance measure Levenshtein Distance Distance Jaro Distance Distance Hamming Distance feature vector
Feature vector computed reference string Ex name
There existing dictionary list pair character visually similar
See Therefore I suggest try modified edit distance compute edit distance cost function treat distance pair visually similar character zero much smaller distance pair different character
I recommend using
It includes transposition among change considers
There reason believe corresponds better mistake made human
So maybe correspond better human consider similar
Another plausible approach would render two string image using whatever font think used display compare image
To compare visually similar image basic starting point would use distance shown correspond well human perception situation
This probably wo enough fail badly image perfectly aligned
To address I suggest apply sort edit distance allows inserting deleting entire column pixel column addition changing individual pixel
It clear whether machine learning useful
The obvious approach try first would compute edit distance compare threshold
That might sufficient
By posting answer agree

reproduce behavior system using
Computer simulation become useful tool mathematical modeling many natural system human system
Simulation system represented running system model
It used explore gain new insight new estimate performance system complex
Computer simulation either small running almost instantly small device program run hour day group computer
The scale event simulated computer simulation far exceeded anything possible perhaps even imaginable using traditional mathematical modeling
Over year ago simulation one force invading another involved modeling tank truck vehicle simulated terrain around using multiple supercomputer High Performance Computer Modernization Program
Other example include model material deformation model complex organelle living organism complete simulation life cycle project Switzerland begun May create first computer simulation entire human brain right molecular level
Because computational cost simulation used perform inference
A algorithm equation used capture behavior system modeled
By contrast computer simulation actual running program contains equation algorithm
Simulation therefore process running model
Thus one would build simulation instead one would build model either run model equivalently run simulation
Computer simulation developed rapid growth computer following first deployment model process
It simulation using
Computer simulation often used adjunct substitute modeling system simple possible
There many type computer simulation common feature attempt generate sample representative scenario model complete enumeration possible state model would prohibitive impossible
The external data requirement simulation model vary widely
For input might number example simulation waveform AC electricity wire others might require terabyte information weather climate model
Input source also vary widely Lastly time data available varies Because variety diverse simulation system many common element large number specialized simulation language
The may sometimes called year proposed
There
Systems accept data external source must careful knowing receiving
While easy computer read value text binary file much harder knowing compared value
Often expressed error bar minimum maximum deviation value range within true value expected lie
Because digital computer mathematics perfect rounding truncation error multiply error useful perform error analysis confirm value output simulation still usefully accurate
Even small error original data accumulate substantial error later simulation
While computer analysis subject GIGO restriction especially true digital simulation
Indeed observation inherent cumulative error digital system main catalyst development
Computer model classified according several independent pair attribute including Another way categorizing model look underlying data structure
For simulation two main class Equations define relationship element modeled system attempt find state system equilibrium
Such model often used simulating physical system simpler modeling case dynamic simulation attempted
Formerly output data computer simulation sometimes presented table matrix showing data affected numerous change simulation
The use matrix format related traditional use matrix concept
However psychologist others noted human could quickly perceive trend looking graph even generated data displayed CGI animation
Although observer could necessarily read number quote math formula observing moving weather chart might able predict event see rain headed way much faster scanning table
Such intense graphical display transcended world number formula sometimes also led output lacked coordinate grid omitted timestamps straying far numeric data display
Today model tend balance view moving cloud map us numeric coordinate numeric timestamps event
Similarly CGI computer simulation simulate might shrink change extended period medical treatment presenting passage time spinning view visible human head tumor change
Other application CGI computer simulation developed graphically display large amount data motion change occur simulation run
Generic example type computer simulation science derived underlying mathematical description Specific example computer simulation follow Notable sometimes controversial computer simulation used science include used Thomas Ray
In social science computer simulation integral component five angle analysis fostered data percolation methodology also includes qualitative quantitative method review literature including scholarly interview expert form extension data triangulation
design simulation developed
Special care taken handle event situation simulation equation valid changed
The open project started develop reusable library simulation together complete graphical environment generates code based library
Computer simulation used wide variety practical context The reliability trust people put computer simulation depends simulation therefore crucial importance development computer simulation
Another important aspect computer simulation reproducibility result meaning simulation model provide different answer execution
Although might seem obvious special point attention random number actually number
An exception reproducibility simulation flight simulation
Here human part simulation thus influence outcome way hard impossible reproduce exactly
manufacturer make use computer simulation test safety feature new design
By building copy car physic simulation environment save hundred thousand dollar would otherwise required build test unique prototype
Engineers step simulation millisecond time determine exact stress put upon section prototype
used display result computer simulation
used experience simulation
In case animation may also useful faster even slower mode
For example faster animation useful visualizing buildup queue simulation human evacuating building
Furthermore simulation result often aggregated static image using various way
In debugging simulating program execution test rather executing natively detect far error hardware detect time log useful debugging information instruction trace memory alteration instruction count
This technique also detect similar hard detect error well produce performance information data
Although sometimes ignored computer simulation important perform ensure accuracy result properly understood
For example probabilistic risk analysis factor determining success oilfield exploration program involves combining sample variety statistical distribution using
If instance one key parameter net ratio stratum known one significant figure result simulation might precise one significant figure although might misleadingly presented four significant figure
The following three step used produce accurate simulation model calibration verification validation
Computer simulation good portraying comparing theoretical scenario order accurately model actual case study match actually happening today
A base model created calibrated match area studied
The calibrated model verified ensure model operating expected based input
Once model verified final step validate model comparing output historical data study area
This done using statistical technique ensuring adequate value
Unless technique employed simulation model created produce inaccurate result useful prediction tool
Model calibration achieved adjusting available parameter order adjust model operates simulates process
For example traffic simulation typical parameter include distance sensitivity discharge headway lost time
These parameter influence driver behavior long take driver change lane much distance driver leaf car car front quickly driver start accelerate intersection
Adjusting parameter direct effect amount traffic volume traverse modeled roadway network making driver le aggressive
These example calibration parameter match characteristic observed field study location
Most traffic model typical default value may need adjusted better match driver behavior specific location studied
Model verification achieved obtaining output data model comparing expected input data
For example traffic simulation traffic volume verified ensure actual volume throughput model reasonably close traffic volume input model
Ten percent typical threshold used traffic simulation determine output volume reasonably close input volume
Simulation model handle model input different way traffic enters network example may may reach desired destination
Additionally traffic want enter network may able congestion exists
This model verification important part modeling process
The final step validate model comparing result expected based historical data study area
Ideally model produce similar result happened historically
This typically verified nothing quoting statistic fit
This statistic measure fraction variability accounted model
A high value necessarily mean model fit data well
Another tool used validate model graphical residual analysis
If model output value drastically differ historical value probably mean error model
Before using model base produce additional model important verify different scenario ensure one accurate
If output reasonably match historic value validation process model reviewed updated produce result line expectation
It iterative process help produce realistic model
Validating traffic simulation model requires comparing traffic estimated model observed traffic roadway transit system
Initial comparison trip interchange quadrant sector large area interest
The next step compare traffic estimated model traffic count including transit ridership crossing contrived barrier study area
These typically called screenlines cutlines cordon line may imaginary actual physical barrier
Cordon line surround particular area city central business district major activity center
Transit ridership estimate commonly validated comparing actual patronage crossing cordon line around central business district
Three source error cause weak correlation calibration input error model error parameter error
In general input error parameter error adjusted easily user
Model error however caused methodology used model may easy fix
Simulation model typically built using several different modeling theory produce conflicting result
Some model generalized others detailed
If model error occurs result may necessary adjust model methodology make result consistent
In order produce good model used produce realistic result necessary step need taken order ensure simulation model functioning properly
Simulation model used tool verify engineering theory valid calibrated properly
Once satisfactory estimate parameter model obtained model must checked assure adequately perform intended function
The validation process establishes credibility model demonstrating ability replicate actual traffic pattern
The importance model validation underscore need careful planning thoroughness accuracy input data collection program purpose
Efforts made ensure collected data consistent expected value
For example traffic analysis typical traffic engineer perform site visit verify traffic count become familiar traffic pattern area
The resulting model forecast better data used model estimation validation

Models central importance many scientific context
The centrality model billiard ball model gas Bohr model atom MIT bag model nucleon model polymer Lorenz model atmosphere model interaction double helix model DNA evolutionary model social science general equilibrium model market respective domain case point
Scientists spend great deal time building testing comparing revising model much journal space dedicated introducing applying interpreting valuable tool
In short model one principal instrument modern science
Philosophers acknowledging importance model increasing attention probing assorted role model play scientific practice
The result incredible proliferation philosophical literature
Probing model phenomenological model computational model developmental model explanatory model impoverished model testing model idealized model theoretical model scale model heuristic model caricature model didactic model fantasy model toy model imaginary model mathematical model substitute model iconic model formal model analogue model instrumental model notion used categorize model
While first glance abundance overwhelming quickly brought control recognizing notion pertain different problem arise connection model
For example model raise question semantics representational function model perform
ontology kind thing model
epistemology learn model
course general philosophy science model relate theory
implication model based approach science debate scientific realism reductionism explanation law nature
Models perform two fundamentally different representational function
On one hand model representation selected part world target system
Depending nature target model either model phenomenon model data
On hand model represent theory sense interprets law axiom theory
These two notion mutually exclusive scientific model representation sens time
Many scientific model represent phenomenon phenomenon used umbrella term covering relatively stable general feature world interesting scientific point view
Empiricists like van Fraassen allow observables qualify realist like Bogen Woodward impose restriction
The billiard ball model gas Bohr model atom double helix model DNA scale model bridge model open economy Lorenz model atmosphere example model kind
A first step towards discussion issue scientific representation realize thing problem scientific representation
Rather different related problem
It yet clear specific set question theory representation come term whatever list question one might put agenda theory scientific representation two problem occupy center stage discussion Frigg
The first problem explain virtue model representation something else
To appreciate thrust question anticipate position regard ontology model discus next section
It common construe model entity rather description
This approach consequence
If understand model description question would reduced problem language relates reality would problem already discussed philosophy language
However understand model entity faced new question object word sentence scientifically represent phenomenon
Somewhat surprisingly recently question attracted much attention twentieth century philosophy science despite fact corresponding problem philosophy mind aesthetic discussed extensively decade substantial body literature dealing question mean mental state represent certain state affair question configuration flat mark canvas depict something beyond canvas puzzled aesthetician long time
However recent publication address closely related problem Contessa Elgin Frigg Knuuttila Morrison Giere Suárez Suárez Solé Toon van Fraassen others dismiss Callender Cohen Teller
The second problem concerned representational style
It commonplace one represent subject matter different way
This pluralism seem prerogative fine art representation used science one kind either
Weizsäcker liquid drop model represents nucleus atom manner different shell model scale model wing air plane represents wing way different mathematical model shape
What representational style science
Although question explicitly addressed literature semantic view theory answer seem emerge understanding model
One version semantic view one build mathematical notion model see Sec
posit model target isomorphic van Fraassen Suppes partially isomorphic Da Costa French
Formal requirement weaker discussed Mundy Swoyer
Another version semantic view drop formal requirement favor similarity Giere Teller
This approach enjoys advantage isomorphism view le restrictive also account case inexact simplifying model
However Giere point account remains empty long relevant respect degree similarity specified
The specification respect degree depends problem hand larger scientific context made basis purely philosophical consideration Teller
Further notion understood addressing issue representational style introduced literature model
Among scale model idealized model analogical model phenomenological model play important role
These category mutually exclusive instance scale model would also qualify idealized model clear exactly draw line idealized analogue model

Some model basically enlarged copy target system Black
Typical example wooden car model bridge
The leading intuition scale model naturalistic replica truthful mirror image target reason scale model sometimes also referred true model Achinstein Ch

However thing perfectly faithful scale model faithfulness always restricted respect
The wooden model car instance provides faithful portrayal car shape material
Scale model seem special case broader category representation Peirce dubbed icon representation stand something else closely resemble Peirce Vol
Para

This raise question criterion model satisfy order qualify icon
Although seem strong intuition answer question particular case theory iconicity model formulated yet

An idealization deliberate simplification something complicated objective making tractable
Frictionless plane point mass infinite velocity isolated system omniscient agent market perfect equilibrium example
Philosophical debate idealization focused two general kind idealization Aristotelian Galilean idealization
Aristotelian idealization amount stripping away imagination property concrete object believe relevant problem hand
This allows u focus limited set property isolation
An example classical mechanic model planetary system describing planet object shape mass disregarding property
Other label kind idealization include abstraction Cartwright Ch
negligibility assumption Musgrave method isolation Mäki
Galilean idealization one involve deliberate distortion
Physicists build model consisting point mass moving frictionless plane economist assume agent omniscient biologist study isolated population
It characteristic Galileo approach science use simplification sort whenever situation complicated tackle
For reason common refer sort idealization Galilean idealization McMullin another common label distorted model
Galilean idealization beset riddle
What model involving distortion kind tell u reality
How test accuracy
In reply question Laymon put forward theory understands idealization ideal limit imagine series experimental refinement actual situation approach postulated limit require closer property system come ideal limit closer behavior come behavior ideal limit monotonicity
But condition need always hold clear understand situation ideal limit exists
We least principle produce series table top ever slippery possibly produce series system Planck constant approach zero
This raise question whether one always make idealized model realistic
We come back issue section
Galilean Aristotelian idealization mutually exclusive
On contrary often come together
Consider mechanical model planetary system model take account narrow set property distorts instance describing planet ideal sphere mass distribution
Models involve substantial Galilean well Aristotelian idealization sometimes referred caricature Gibbard Varian
Caricature model isolate small number salient characteristic system distort extreme case
A classical example Ackerlof model car market explains difference price new used car solely term asymmetric information thereby disregarding factor may influence price car
However controversial whether highly idealized model still regarded informative representation target system discussion caricature model particular economics see Reiss
At point would like mention notion seems closely related idealization namely approximation
Although term sometimes used interchangeably seems clear difference two
Approximations introduced mathematical context
One mathematical item approximation another one close relevant sense
What item may vary
Sometimes want approximate one curve another one
This happens expand function power series keep first two three term
In situation approximate equation another one letting control parameter tend towards zero Redhead
The salient point issue physical interpretation need arise
Unlike Galilean idealization involves distortion real system approximation purely formal matter
This course imply interesting relation approximation idealization
For instance approximation justified pointing mathematical pendant acceptable idealization
neglect dissipative term equation make idealizing assumption system frictionless

Standard example analogical model include hydraulic model economic system billiard ball model gas computer model mind liquid drop model nucleus
At basic level two thing analogous certain relevant similarity
Hesse distinguishes different type analogy according kind similarity relation two object enter
A simple type analogy one based shared property
There analogy earth moon based fact large solid opaque spherical body receiving heat light sun revolving around ax gravitating towards body
But sameness property necessary condition
An analogy two object also based relevant similarity property
In liberal sense say analogy sound light echo similar reflection loudness brightness pitch color detectability ear detectability eye
Analogies also based sameness resemblance relation part two system rather monadic property
It sense politician assert relation father child analogous relation state citizen
The analogy mentioned far Hesse call material analogy
We obtain formal notion analogy abstract concrete feature system posse focus formal
What analogue model share target set feature pattern abstract relationship
structure structure understood formal sense
This notion analogy closely related Hesse call formal analogy
Two item related formal analogy interpretation formal calculus
For instance formal analogy swinging pendulum oscillating electric circuit described mathematical equation
A distinction due Hesse one positive negative neutral analogy
The positive analogy two item consists property relation share gas molecule billiard ball mass negative analogy one share billiard ball colored gas molecule
The neutral analogy comprises property known yet whether belong positive negative analogy
Neutral analogy play important role scientific research give rise question suggest new hypothesis
In vein various author emphasized heuristic role analogy play theory construction creative thought Hesse Holyoak Thagard Kroes Psillos essay collected Hellman

Phenomenological model defined different though related way
A traditional definition take model represent observable property target refrain postulating hidden mechanism like
Another approach due McMullin defines phenomenological model model independent theory
This however seems strong
Many phenomenological model failing derivable theory incorporate principle law associated theory
The liquid drop model atomic nucleus instance portrays nucleus liquid drop describes several property surface tension charge among others originating different theory hydrodynamics electrodynamics respectively
Certain aspect usually complete used determine static dynamical property nucleus

Each notion still somewhat vague suffers internal problem much work need done tighten
But pressing issue question different notion relate
Are analogy fundamentally different idealization occupy different area continuous scale
How icon differ idealization analogy
At present know answer question
What need systematic account different way model relate reality way compare
Another kind representational model model data Suppes
A model data corrected rectified regimented many instance idealized version data gain immediate observation raw data
Characteristically one first eliminates error
remove point record due faulty observation present data neat way instance drawing smooth curve set point
These two step commonly referred data reduction curve fitting
When investigate trajectory certain planet instance first eliminate point fallacious observation record fit smooth curve remaining one
Models data play crucial role confirming theory model data often messy complex raw data compare theoretical prediction
The construction data model extremely complicated
It requires sophisticated statistical technique raise serious methodological well philosophical question
How decide point record need removed
And given clean set data curve fit
The first question dealt mainly within context philosophy experiment see instance Galison Staley
At heart latter question lie curve fitting problem data indicate form fitted curve take
Traditional discussion theory choice suggest issue settled background theory consideration simplicity prior probability combination
Forster Sober point formulation curve fitting problem slight overstatement theorem statistic due Akaike show given certain assumption data underwrite though determine inference concerning curve shape assume fitted curve chosen strike balance simplicity goodness fit way maximizes predictive accuracy
Further discussion data model found Chin Brewer Harris Laymon Mayo
In modern logic model structure make sentence theory true theory taken usually deductively closed set sentence formal language see Bell Machover Hodges detail
The structure model sense theory represents
As simple example consider Euclidean geometry consists
two point joined straight line theorem derived axiom
Any structure statement true model Euclidean geometry
A structure composite entity consisting set individual called domain universe ii indexed set
ordered list operation may empty iii indexed set relation
It important note nothing object matter definition mere dummy
Similarly operation function specified purely extensionally relation defined class function taking argument defined class
If sentence theory true symbol interpreted referring either object relation function structure model theory
Many model science carry logic idea interpretation abstract calculus
This particularly pertinent physic general Newton equation heart theory
These law applied particular
choosing special force function making assumption mass distribution pendulum etc
The resulting model interpretation realization general law
There variety thing commonly referred model physical object fictional object structure description equation combination
However category neither mutually exclusive jointly exhaustive
Where one draw line say fictional object structure may well depend one metaphysical conviction model may fall yet another class thing
What model course interesting question right briefly indicated last section also important implication semantics see epistemology
Some model straightforward physical object
These commonly referred material model
The class material model comprises anything physical entity serf scientific representation something else
Among member class find stock example like wooden model bridge plane ship Watson Crick metal model DNA Schaffner Phillips hydraulic model economy Morgan Boumans
More cutting edge case material model model organism organism used life science organism Ankeny Ankeny Leonelli Leonelli
Material model give rise ontological difficulty quibble connection object metaphysicians deal
nature property identity object part whole
Many model material model
The Bohr model atom frictionless pendulum isolated population instance scientist mind rather laboratory physically realized experimented upon perform representational function
It seems natural view fictional entity
This position traced back German Vaihinger emphasized importance fiction scientific reasoning
Giere recently advocated view model abstract entity
It entirely clear Giere mean abstract entity discussion mechanical model seems suggest us term designate fictional entity
This view square well scientific practice scientist often talk model object well philosophical view see manipulation model essential part process scientific investigation Morgan
It natural assume one manipulate something exists
Furthermore model often property explicitly attribute construct interesting vehicle research
A view regard model object easily explain without ado introduce model use identifying description object exhaustively characterized description
Research simply amount finding object thus identified
The drawback suggestion fictional entity notoriously beset ontological riddle
This led many philosopher argue thing fictional entity apparent ontological commitment must renounced
The influential deflationary account go back Quine
Building Russell discussion definite description Quine argues illusion refer fictional entity talk
Instead dispose alleged object turning term refer predicate analyse sentence like Pegasus exist nothing pegasizes
By eliminating troublesome term eschew ontological commitment seem carry
This resulted lack interest fictional entity particular among philosopher science
In programmatic essay Fine draw attention neglect submits Quinean skepticism notwithstanding fiction play important role scientific reasoning
However Fine offer systematic account fiction put use science
The issue understand fiction science subject matter recent debate philosophy modeling
Barberousse Ludwig Contessa Frigg Leng Toon develop view see model fiction kind
Giere denies earlier work understood way argues viewing model fiction
Magnani Pincock Teller second Giere argue model regarded fiction
Weisberg argues middle position see model playing heuristic role denies form part scientific model
An influential point view take model structure
This position traced back Suppes slight variant held proponent semantic view theory
Needless say difference different version semantic view van Fraassen instance emphasizes model structure survey different position found Suppe Ch

However account model structure one sort another Da Costa French
As model kind often closely tied mathematized science sometimes also referred mathematical model
For discussion model biology see Lloyd
This view model criticized different ground
One pervasive criticism many type model play important role science structure accommodated within structuralist view model neither account model constructed work context investigation Cartwright Downes Morrison
Another charge held approach possible explain structure represent target system form part physical world without making assumption go beyond approach afford Frigg
A position scientist display scientific paper textbook present model le stylized description relevant target system Achinstein Black
This view subject explicit criticism
However criticism marshaled syntactic view theory equally threaten linguistic understanding model
First commonplace describe thing different way
But identify model description new description yield new model seems counterintuitive
One translate description language formal natural one would say one hereby obtains different model
Second model different property description
On one hand say model solar system consists sphere orbiting around big mass population model isolated environment seem make sense say description
On hand description property model
A description written English consist word printed red ink
None make sense said model
The descriptivist face challenge either make case argument mistaken show get around difficulty
Another group thing habitually referred model particular economics equation also termed mathematical model
The model stock market model open economy case point
The problem suggestion equation syntactic item face objection similar one put forward description
First one describe situation using different result obtain different equation seem obtain different model
Second model property different equation
An oscillator equation describing motion
Equally equation may inhomogeneous system describes
The proposal discussed far tacitly assumed model belongs one particular class object
But assumption necessary
It might case model mixture element belonging different ontological category
In vein Morgan suggests model involve structural well narrative element story call
Models vehicle learning world
Significant part scientific investigation carried model rather reality studying model discover feature ascertain fact system model stand brief model allow surrogative reasoning Swoyer
For instance study nature hydrogen atom dynamic population behavior polymer studying respective model
This cognitive function model widely acknowledged literature even suggest model give rise new style reasoning model based reasoning Magnani Nersessian Magnani Nersessian Thagard
This leaf u question learning model possible
Hughes provides general framework discussing question
According DDI account learning take place three stage denotation demonstration interpretation
We begin establishing representation relation denotation model target
Then investigate feature model order demonstrate certain theoretical claim internal constitution mechanism
learn model demonstration
Finally finding converted claim target system Hughes refers step interpretation
It latter two notion stake
Learning model happens two place construction manipulation model Morgan
There fixed rule recipe model building activity figuring fit together affords opportunity learn model
Once model built learn property looking use manipulate model order elicit secret
Depending kind model dealing building manipulating model amount different activity demanding different methodology
Material model seem unproblematic used common experimental context
put model car wind tunnel measure air resistance
Hence far learning model concerned material model give raise question go beyond question experimentation generally
Not fictional model
What constraint construction fictional model manipulate
The natural response seems answer question performing thought experiment
Different author
Brown Gendler Norton Reiss Sorensen explored line argument reached different often conflicting conclusion thought experiment performed status outcome detail see entry thought experiment
An important class model mathematical nature
In case possible derive result solve equation analytically
But quite often case
It point invention computer great impact allows u solve equation otherwise intractable making computer simulation
Many part current research natural social science rely computer simulation
The formation development star galaxy detailed dynamic heavy ion reaction aspect intricate process evolution life well outbreak war progression economy decision procedure organization moral behavior explored computer simulation mention example Hegselmann et al
Skyrms
What simulation
Simulations characteristically used connection dynamic model
model involve time
The aim simulation solve equation motion model designed represent target system
So one say simulation imitates usually real process another process Hartmann Humphreys
It claimed computer simulation constitute genuinely new methodology science even new scientific paradigm moreover also raise new host philosophical issue Humphreys Rohrlich Winsberg various contribution Sismondo Gissis
Hence claim simulation call question philosophical understanding many aspect science
However enthusiasm shared universally argue simulation far demanding new philosophy science raise new philosophical problem Frigg Reiss
Whether one see computer simulation raising fundamentally new philosophical issue doubt practical significance
When standard method fail computer simulation often way learn something dynamical model help u extend Humphreys
An important question arises context justification simulation result trust output computer simulation
An influential strand attempt come grip question exploit similarity traditional experiment computer simulation raise vexing question relation computer simulation experiment Barberousse Franceschelli Imbert Morgan Morrison Parker Winsberg
This question trustworthiness broken equation model represent target system accurately enough purpose hand b computer provide accurate enough solution equation
Practicioners refer respectively problem validation problem verification
In practice often face version Duhem problem one evaluate net outcome simulation possible address two issue one one
This led scientist develop various method test whether outcome simulation target discussion see Winsberg
Computer simulation also heuristically important
They may suggest new theory model hypothesis example based systematic exploration model parameter space Hartmann
But computer simulation also bear methodological peril
They may provide misleading result due discrete nature calculation carried digital computer allow exploration part full parameter space subspace may reveal certain important feature model
The severity problem somehow mitigated increasing power modern computer
But availability computational power also may adverse effect
It may encourage scientist swiftly come increasingly complex conceptually premature model involving poorly understood assumption mechanism many additional adjustable parameter discussion related problem context individual actor model social science see Schnell
This may lead increase empirical may welcome come example forecasting necessarily better understanding underlying mechanism
As result use computer simulation may change weight assign various goal science
Finally availability computer power may seduce scientist making calculation degree trustworthiness one would expect
This happens instance computer used propagate probability distribution forward time taken decision relevant probability even though turn upon closer examination see Frigg

So important carried away mean new powerful computer offer thereby place sight actual goal research
Once knowledge model knowledge translated knowledge target system
It point representational function model becomes important
Models instruct u nature reality assume least model aspect counterpart world
But learning tied representation different kind representation analogy idealization etc
also different kind learning
If instance model take realistic depiction transfer knowledge model target accomplished different manner deal analogue model involves idealizing assumption
What different way learning
Although numerous case study made certain specific model work seem general account transfer knowledge model target achieved possible exception theory analogical reasoning see reference
This difficult question one deserves attention gotten far
One perplexing question connection model relate theory
The separation model theory hazy one jargon many scientist often difficult impossible draw line
So question distinction model theory relate one another
In common parlance term model theory sometimes used express attitude towards particular piece science
The phrase model indicates hypothesis stake asserted tentatively even known false something awarded label theory acquired degree general acceptance
However way drawing line model theory use systematic understanding model
The syntactic view theory integral part logical positivist picture science construes theory set sentence axiomatized system first order logic
Within approach term model used wider narrower sense
In wider sense model system semantic rule interpret abstract calculus study model amount scrutinizing semantics scientific language
In narrower sense model alternative interpretation certain calculus Braithwaite Campbell Nagel Spector
If instance take mathematics used kinetic theory gas reinterpret term calculus way make refer billiard ball billiard ball model kinetic theory gas
Proponents syntactic view believe model irrelevant science
Models hold superfluous addition best pedagogical aesthetical psychological value Carnap Hempel see also
The semantic view theory see
van Fraassen Giere Suppe Suppes revers standpoint declares dispense formal calculus altogether view theory family model
Although different version semantic view assume different notion model see agree model central unit scientific theorizing
One perspicuous criticism semantic view mislocates place model scientific edifice
Models relatively independent theory rather constitutive use Morrison slogan autonomous agent
This independence two aspect construction functioning Morgan Morrison
A look model constructed actual science show neither derived entirely data theory

Model building art mechanical procedure
The London model superconductivity affords u good example relationship
The model principal equation theoretical justification sense could derived electromagnetic fundamental theory motivated solely basis phenomenological consideration Cartwright et al

Or put another way model constructed bottom top therefore enjoys great deal independence theory
The second aspect independence model perform function could perform part strongly dependent theory

A theory may incompletely specified sense imposes certain general constraint remains silent detail concrete situation provided model Redhead
A special case situation qualitative theory known model introduces quantitative measure Apostel
example theory underdetermined way axiomatic quantum field theory imposes certain general constraint quantum field provide account particular field
While Redhead others seem think case sort somehow special Cartwright argued rule rather exception
On view fundamental theory classical mechanic quantum mechanic represent anything describe real world situation
Laws theory schema need concretized filled detail specific situation task accomplished model

Theories may complicated handle
In case simplified model may employed allows solution Apostel Redhead
Quantum chromodynamics instance easily used study hadron structure nucleus although fundamental theory problem
To get around difficulty physicist construct tractable phenomenological model
MIT bag model effectively describes relevant degree freedom system consideration Hartmann
The advantage model yield result theory remain silent
Their drawback often clear understand relationship theory model two strictly speaking contradictory
A extreme case use model theory available
We encounter situation domain particularly rampant biology economics overarching theory often

The notion model substitute theory closely related notion developmental model
This term coined Leplin pointed useful model development early quantum theory used umbrella notion covering case model sort preliminary exercise theory
A closely related notion one probing model also study model toy model
These model perform representational function expected instruct u anything beyond model

As Wimsatt point false model genetics perform many useful function among following false model help answer question realistic model provide arena answering question property complex model factor phenomenon would otherwise seen serve limiting case general model two false model may define extreme continuum case real case supposed lie lead identification relevant variable estimation value
The debate scientific model important repercussion debate philosophy science
The reason traditionally debate scientific realism reductionism explanation law nature couched term theory theory acknowledged carrier scientific knowledge
So question whether discussion matter change shift focus theory model
Up comprehensive account issue developed model leave trace discussion topic
It claimed practice model building favor antirealism realism
Antirealists point truth main goal scientific modeling
Cartwright instance present several case study illustrating good model often false supposedly true theory might help much come understanding say working laser
Realists deny falsity model render realist approach science impossible pointing good model thought literally true usually least approximately true
Laymon argues prediction model typically become better relax idealization
model take support realism see also McMullin Nowak Brzezinski Nowak
Apart usual complaint elusiveness notion approximate truth antirealists taken issue reply two related reason
First Cartwright point reason assume one always improve model adding correction
Second seems outlined procedure accordance scientific practice
It unusual scientist invest work repeatedly existing model
Rather shift completely different modeling framework adjustment made get involved Hartmann
The various model atomic nucleus case point
Once realized shell effect important understand various phenomenon collective liquid drop model put aside shell model developed account finding
A difficulty idealization controlled
It example clear way one could Model eventually arrive quantum chromodynamics supposedly correct underlying theory
A antirealist argument incompatible model argument take starting point observation scientist often successfully use several incompatible model target system predictive purpose Morrison
These model seemingly contradict ascribe different property target system
In nuclear physic instance liquid drop model explores analogy atomic nucleus charged fluid drop shell model describes nuclear property term property proton neutron constituent atomic nucleus
This practice appears cause problem scientific realism
Realists typically hold close connection predictive success theory least approximately true
But several theory system predictively successful theory mutually inconsistent true even approximately
Realists react argument various way
First challenge claim model question indeed predictively successful
If model good predictor argument blocked
Second defend version perspectival realism Giere Rueger according model reveals one aspect phenomenon question taken together full fuller account emerges
Third realist deny problem first place scientific model always idealized one way another therefore strictly speaking false wrong vehicle make point realism
The problem mentioned last section raise question different model related
Evidently multiple model target system generally stand deductive relation often contradict
Given model seem indispensable practice science simple picture organization science along line model reduction Oppenheim Putnam pyramid picture seem plausible
Some suggested Cartwright Hacking picture science according systematic relation hold different model
Some model tied together represent target system imply enter relationship deductive otherwise
We confronted patchwork model hold specific domain applicability see also paper collected Falkenburg Muschik
Some argue picture least partially incorrect various interesting relation hold different model theory
These relation range controlled approximation singular limit relation Batterman structural relation Gähde rather loose relation called story Hartmann see also Bokulich
These suggestion made basis case study instance effective quantum field theory see Hartmann remains seen whether general account relation given whether deeper justification provided instance Bayesian framework first step towards Bayesian understanding reduction found

It widely held science aim discovering law nature
Philosophers turn faced challenge explicating law nature
According two currently dominant account best system approach universal approach law nature understood universal scope meaning apply everything world
This take law seem square view see model center scientific theorizing
What role general law play science model represent happening world model law related
One possible response argue law nature govern entity process model rather world
Fundamental law approach state fact world hold true entity process model
Different variant view advocated Cartwright Giere van Fraassen
Surprisingly realist law seem responded challenge remains open question whether realistic understanding law approach science made compatible
Laws nature play important role many account explanation prominently model unification approach
Unfortunately account inherit problem beset relationship model law
This leaf u two option
Either one argue law dispensed explanation idea employed van Fraassen pragmatic theory explanation approach causal explanation Woodward
According latter model tool find causal relation hold certain fact process relation explanatory job
Or one shift explanatory burden model
A positive suggestion along line simulacrum account explanation suggests explain phenomenon constructing model fit phenomenon basic framework grand theory Ch

On account model explanation seek
This square well basic scientific intuition leaf u question notion explanation work see also Elgin Sober
Bokulich pursues similar line reasoning see explanatory power model closely related fictional nature
Models play important role science
But despite fact generated considerable interest among philosopher remain significant lacuna understanding model work

The model basic element scientific method
Everything done science done model
A model simplification substitute actually studying trying predict
Models used convenient substitute way recipe convenient aid cooking
This section book dedicated explaining model used
Models common
The ingredient list bottle ketchup model content margarine model butter
A box score baseball game model actual event
A trial automobile accident model actual accident
A history exam model designed test knowledge history
A model substitute also similar represents
Thus ingredient list fairly accurate guide content ketchup bottle
Margarine look spread like butter substitute many recipe
The box score contains critical information baseball game winner final score pitcher
Similarly trial history exam contain essence event model
In fact model common ubiquitous
Nearly everything encounter model
To drive home point list Table several object idea model
Table Everyday Models Cake recipe Process making cake Wedding picture The wedding Chapter title Chapter content News article Chicago Cubs latest loss The game Home video police arresting motorist Police conduct general Road map Madison Wisconsin Paths transit Madison Household budget Household expense income Political candidate campaign promise Candidate performance elected statistical average something close expected Scientific model fundamentally model outside science introduced
Many people think mistakenly scientific model always complicated impenetrable mathematical equation
But truth many scientific model understandable model found outside science
The USDA food pyramid recommends proportion different kind food healthy diet model thousand scientific study undertaken relation among cancer heart disease diet
The figure summarizes study picture recommends healthy diet
Thus figure substitute many scientific study diet also substitute actual diet
As second example scientist use rat determine whether food additive cause cancer rat become model human
Rats convenient relatively easy raise lab least compared human one perform experiment relatively quickly matter month rather year
Moreover people find ethical experiment rat rather human
We heard hypothesis theory especially physic chemistry
Theories usually comprise idea scientist nature work totally sure
Hypotheses theory merely particular kind model refer abstract model
Even rudimentary science course contains grand model scientist discovered
The periodic table element model chemist use predicting property element
Physicists use Newton law predict object interact planet spaceship
In geology continental drift model predicts past position continent
But three model atypical immensely successful
Most model used nowhere near powerful widely useful
But scientist use one anyway
Models used every turn scientific study
Samples model
Ideas model
Methods model
Every attempt scientific study involves countless model many small interest small group scientist
The primary activity hundred thousand scientist produce new model resulting ten thousand scientific paper published per year
Trying enumerate model found business industry society simply impossible
Models pervade white collar job
Table show model field diverse advertising architecture finance manufacturing
In table chosen give single model number field
However could easily picked one job say retail sale listed model associated
Table Models Business Government Advertising Response advertisement tested single city model national response ad
Architecture The plan new building model actual building
Business Past dealing client model trustworthiness promptness expect next deal
Education A student performance history exam model everything learned history since last exam
Finance The rating Federal The federal budget based economic model predicts next revenue expenditure
Franchising A company us existing store model likely success store considering building
Law A criminal trial provides model actual crime
Manufacturing Profit projection based model material labor cost well sale price
Medicine Your doctor diagnosis cause back pain model actual cause
Prisons A model based age crime family status used predict prisoner good candidate parole
Retail Sales The December sale model December sale expected coming year
The ability recognize construct improve model give advantage many walk life
A salesperson recognizes sale pitch model take step improve
Other model obvious complicated year effort go learning build house computer automobile model trade architect engineer
Sometimes critical skill finding building model knowing improve existing model budget airline design
Models important outside science success professional endeavor involves accurately predicting manipulating future need model
Correctly predicting stock market would net person fame fortune
The path success sale slightly le direct
If salesperson accurately predict particular client respond particular pitch pitch modified maximum effectiveness thereby increasing probability sale abandoning wasting much time
Similarly budget predict financial consequence taking various action allowing company cut loss increase profit
The art action movie like Lethal Weapon III abstract painting Picasso historical novel Michener poetry model designed evoke emotion present unusual event viewpoint
Because scene Hollywood movie appears plausible representation real world make frightened stunt man hanging window sad dead heroine anxious oncoming train
The protagonist historical novel substitute someone actually lived
There thing one model something anything use model necessarily useful one kind model
A wedding many different model remind u day picture memory wedding present newspaper account model one event
At time one wedding present toaster model wedding also model toaster company made toaster product may eventually become model electronic appliance one kid parent take apart fix see work
It neither profound particularly useful learn everything model
If could say model would call focus heavily
The model discussed thus far chosen show already familiar model
In remainder chapter describe model subtle explain understanding model may important people outside science
Different kind model used different purpose
Table list three major type used class abstract physical sampling model
Not model fit neatly category
Moreover wo bother classify many model course
However three class accommodate many model focus discus convenient group fashion
Table
Classes model Abstract prediction theory hypothesis many mathematical computer model Newton law physic plan recipe statement taking anabolic steroid increase one strength smoking cause lung cancer
Physical organism property replica structure demonstration globe physical model earth u model human physical structure used chemistry class model molecule Sampling random choice personal preference sampling model refers way subject chosen study divided among different group sampling model subject section Data
You end chapter understanding model crucial element scientific method
A model way substitute studied
They widely used many type
At point book able begin using information taught
For example reading news article topic relevant scientific study able identify model used study able identify belonging class Table

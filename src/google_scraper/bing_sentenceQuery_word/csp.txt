In describing
It member family mathematical theory concurrency known process algebra based via
CSP highly influential design programming language also influenced design programming language
CSP first described paper since evolved substantially
CSP practically applied industry tool concurrent aspect variety different system well secure ecommerce system
The theory CSP also still subject active research including work increase range practical applicability increasing scale system tractably analyzed
The version CSP presented Hoare original paper essentially concurrent programming language rather
It substantially different later version CSP posse mathematically defined semantics unable represent
Programs original CSP written parallel composition fixed number sequential process communicating strictly synchronous
In contrast later version CSP process assigned explicit name source destination message defined specifying name intended sending receiving process
For example process repeatedly receives character process named sends character process named
The parallel composition assigns name process process process executes three process concurrently
Following publication original version CSP Hoare Stephen Brookes developed refined CSP modern process algebraic form
The approach taken developing CSP process algebra influenced work CCS vice versa
The theoretical version CSP initially presented article Brookes Hoare Roscoe later Hoare book published
In September book still reference time according albeit unreliable source due nature sampling
The theory CSP undergone minor change since publication Hoare book
Most change motivated advent automated tool CSP process analysis verification
Roscoe describes newer version CSP
An early important application CSP use specification verification element INMOS complex superscalar pipelined processor designed support multiprocessing
CSP employed verifying correctness processor pipeline Virtual Channel Processor managed communication processor
Industrial application CSP software design usually focused dependable system
For example Bremen Institute Safe Systems modeled fault management system avionics interface consisting line code intended use International Space Station CSP analyzed model confirm design free deadlock livelock
The modeling analysis process able uncover number error would difficult detect using testing alone
Similarly applied CSP modeling analysis development software approximately line code secure Certification Authority verify design secure free deadlock
Praxis claim system much lower defect rate comparable system
Since CSP modeling analyzing system incorporate complex message exchange also applied verification communication security protocol
A prominent example sort application Lowe use CSP discover previously unknown attack develop corrected protocol able defeat attack
As name suggests CSP allows description system term component process operate independently interact solely communication
However part CSP name something misnomer since modern CSP allows component process defined sequential process parallel composition primitive process
The relationship different process way process communicates environment described using various operator
Using algebraic approach quite complex process description easily constructed primitive element
CSP provides two class primitive process algebra CSP wide range algebraic operator
The principal one One archetypal CSP example abstract representation chocolate vending machine interaction person wishing buy chocolate
This vending machine might able carry two different event coin choc represent insertion payment delivery chocolate respectively
A machine demand payment offering chocolate written A person might choose use coin card make payment could modelled These two process put parallel interact
The behaviour composite process depends event two component process must synchronise
Thus whereas synchronization required coin would obtain If abstract latter composite process hiding coin card event
get nondeterministic process This process either offer choc event stop stop
In word treat abstraction external view system someone see decision reached person introduced
The syntax CSP defines legal way process event may combined
Let event set event
Then basic CSP defined Note interest brevity syntax presented omits process represents well various operator alphabetized parallel piping indexed choice
CSP imbued several different define syntactically correct CSP expression
The theory CSP includes mutually consistent
The three major denotational model CSP model model model
Semantic mapping process expression three model provide denotational semantics CSP
The defines meaning process expression set sequence event trace process observed perform
For example More formally meaning process trace model defined set possible finite sequence event
The extends trace model refusal set set event process refuse perform
A pair consisting trace refusal set identifies event process may refuse executed trace
The observed behavior process stable failure model described pair
For example The extends failure model handle
The semantics process model pair defined set trace lead divergent behavior
Over year number tool analyzing understanding system described using CSP produced
Early tool implementation used variety syntax CSP making input file written different tool incompatible
However CSP tool standardized dialect CSP devised Bryan Scattergood sometimes referred CSP
The CSP dialect CSP posse formally defined includes embedded
The CSP tool probably commercial product developed Formal Systems Europe often described technically checker convert two CSP process expression LTSs determines whether one process refinement within specified semantic model trace failure
applies various compression algorithm process LTSs order reduce size must explored refinement check
succeeded completely version incorporating amongst thing parallel execution integrated type checker
It released University Oxford also released period
The CSP refinement checker developed Formal Modelling Verification Group
ARC differs internally represents CSP process OBDDs alleviates state explosion problem explicit LTS representation without requiring use compression algorithm used
The project hosted Institut für Informatik Düsseldorf originally created support analysis specification constructed
However also includes support analysis CSP process refinement checking
ProB also used verify property combined CSP B specification
A ProBE CSP Animator integrated
The PAT CSP analysis tool developed School Computing
PAT able perform refinement checking LTL simulation CSP Timed CSP process
The PAT process language extends CSP support mutable shared variable asynchronous message passing variety fairness quantitative time related process construct
The underlying design principle PAT process language combine specification language procedural program
event PAT may sequential program even external C library call greater expressiveness
Mutable shared variable asynchronous channel provide convenient process modelling pattern used standard CSP
The PAT syntax similar identical CSP
The principal difference PAT syntax standard CSP use semicolon terminate process expression inclusion syntactic sugar variable assignment use slightly different syntax internal choice parallel composition
produce animated visualisation CSP system specification support timed CSP
lazy simulator
It model check CSP useful exploring large potentially infinite system
CSP refinement checker interactive modeling analyzing environment
It graphical diagram editor
The user model behavior process CSP expression also diagram
The result checking also reported graphically analyzed interactively peripheral inspecting tool
In addition refinement check It perform deadlock check livelock check
CSP parallel refinement checker
The checking performance linearly scale physical core
Several specification language formalism derived inspired classic untimed CSP including In much concerned concurrent process exchange message broadly similar CSP
However two model make fundamentally different choice regard primitive provide

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

reproduce behavior system using
Computer simulation become useful tool mathematical modeling many natural system human system
Simulation system represented running system model
It used explore gain new insight new estimate performance system complex
Computer simulation either small running almost instantly small device program run hour day group computer
The scale event simulated computer simulation far exceeded anything possible perhaps even imaginable using traditional mathematical modeling
Over year ago simulation one force invading another involved modeling tank truck vehicle simulated terrain around using multiple supercomputer High Performance Computer Modernization Program
Other example include model material deformation model complex organelle living organism complete simulation life cycle project Switzerland begun May create first computer simulation entire human brain right molecular level
Because computational cost simulation used perform inference
A algorithm equation used capture behavior system modeled
By contrast computer simulation actual running program contains equation algorithm
Simulation therefore process running model
Thus one would build simulation instead one would build model either run model equivalently run simulation
Computer simulation developed rapid growth computer following first deployment model process
It simulation using
Computer simulation often used adjunct substitute modeling system simple possible
There many type computer simulation common feature attempt generate sample representative scenario model complete enumeration possible state model would prohibitive impossible
The external data requirement simulation model vary widely
For input might number example simulation waveform AC electricity wire others might require terabyte information weather climate model
Input source also vary widely Lastly time data available varies Because variety diverse simulation system many common element large number specialized simulation language
The may sometimes called year proposed
There
Systems accept data external source must careful knowing receiving
While easy computer read value text binary file much harder knowing compared value
Often expressed error bar minimum maximum deviation value range within true value expected lie
Because digital computer mathematics perfect rounding truncation error multiply error useful perform error analysis confirm value output simulation still usefully accurate
Even small error original data accumulate substantial error later simulation
While computer analysis subject GIGO restriction especially true digital simulation
Indeed observation inherent cumulative error digital system main catalyst development
Computer model classified according several independent pair attribute including Another way categorizing model look underlying data structure
For simulation two main class Equations define relationship element modeled system attempt find state system equilibrium
Such model often used simulating physical system simpler modeling case dynamic simulation attempted
Formerly output data computer simulation sometimes presented table matrix showing data affected numerous change simulation
The use matrix format related traditional use matrix concept
However psychologist others noted human could quickly perceive trend looking graph even generated data displayed CGI animation
Although observer could necessarily read number quote math formula observing moving weather chart might able predict event see rain headed way much faster scanning table
Such intense graphical display transcended world number formula sometimes also led output lacked coordinate grid omitted timestamps straying far numeric data display
Today model tend balance view moving cloud map us numeric coordinate numeric timestamps event
Similarly CGI computer simulation simulate might shrink change extended period medical treatment presenting passage time spinning view visible human head tumor change
Other application CGI computer simulation developed graphically display large amount data motion change occur simulation run
Generic example type computer simulation science derived underlying mathematical description Specific example computer simulation follow Notable sometimes controversial computer simulation used science include used Thomas Ray
In social science computer simulation integral component five angle analysis fostered data percolation methodology also includes qualitative quantitative method review literature including scholarly interview expert form extension data triangulation
design simulation developed
Special care taken handle event situation simulation equation valid changed
The open project started develop reusable library simulation together complete graphical environment generates code based library
Computer simulation used wide variety practical context The reliability trust people put computer simulation depends simulation therefore crucial importance development computer simulation
Another important aspect computer simulation reproducibility result meaning simulation model provide different answer execution
Although might seem obvious special point attention random number actually number
An exception reproducibility simulation flight simulation
Here human part simulation thus influence outcome way hard impossible reproduce exactly
manufacturer make use computer simulation test safety feature new design
By building copy car physic simulation environment save hundred thousand dollar would otherwise required build test unique prototype
Engineers step simulation millisecond time determine exact stress put upon section prototype
used display result computer simulation
used experience simulation
In case animation may also useful faster even slower mode
For example faster animation useful visualizing buildup queue simulation human evacuating building
Furthermore simulation result often aggregated static image using various way
In debugging simulating program execution test rather executing natively detect far error hardware detect time log useful debugging information instruction trace memory alteration instruction count
This technique also detect similar hard detect error well produce performance information data
Although sometimes ignored computer simulation important perform ensure accuracy result properly understood
For example probabilistic risk analysis factor determining success oilfield exploration program involves combining sample variety statistical distribution using
If instance one key parameter net ratio stratum known one significant figure result simulation might precise one significant figure although might misleadingly presented four significant figure
The following three step used produce accurate simulation model calibration verification validation
Computer simulation good portraying comparing theoretical scenario order accurately model actual case study match actually happening today
A base model created calibrated match area studied
The calibrated model verified ensure model operating expected based input
Once model verified final step validate model comparing output historical data study area
This done using statistical technique ensuring adequate value
Unless technique employed simulation model created produce inaccurate result useful prediction tool
Model calibration achieved adjusting available parameter order adjust model operates simulates process
For example traffic simulation typical parameter include distance sensitivity discharge headway lost time
These parameter influence driver behavior long take driver change lane much distance driver leaf car car front quickly driver start accelerate intersection
Adjusting parameter direct effect amount traffic volume traverse modeled roadway network making driver le aggressive
These example calibration parameter match characteristic observed field study location
Most traffic model typical default value may need adjusted better match driver behavior specific location studied
Model verification achieved obtaining output data model comparing expected input data
For example traffic simulation traffic volume verified ensure actual volume throughput model reasonably close traffic volume input model
Ten percent typical threshold used traffic simulation determine output volume reasonably close input volume
Simulation model handle model input different way traffic enters network example may may reach desired destination
Additionally traffic want enter network may able congestion exists
This model verification important part modeling process
The final step validate model comparing result expected based historical data study area
Ideally model produce similar result happened historically
This typically verified nothing quoting statistic fit
This statistic measure fraction variability accounted model
A high value necessarily mean model fit data well
Another tool used validate model graphical residual analysis
If model output value drastically differ historical value probably mean error model
Before using model base produce additional model important verify different scenario ensure one accurate
If output reasonably match historic value validation process model reviewed updated produce result line expectation
It iterative process help produce realistic model
Validating traffic simulation model requires comparing traffic estimated model observed traffic roadway transit system
Initial comparison trip interchange quadrant sector large area interest
The next step compare traffic estimated model traffic count including transit ridership crossing contrived barrier study area
These typically called screenlines cutlines cordon line may imaginary actual physical barrier
Cordon line surround particular area city central business district major activity center
Transit ridership estimate commonly validated comparing actual patronage crossing cordon line around central business district
Three source error cause weak correlation calibration input error model error parameter error
In general input error parameter error adjusted easily user
Model error however caused methodology used model may easy fix
Simulation model typically built using several different modeling theory produce conflicting result
Some model generalized others detailed
If model error occurs result may necessary adjust model methodology make result consistent
In order produce good model used produce realistic result necessary step need taken order ensure simulation model functioning properly
Simulation model used tool verify engineering theory valid calibrated properly
Once satisfactory estimate parameter model obtained model must checked assure adequately perform intended function
The validation process establishes credibility model demonstrating ability replicate actual traffic pattern
The importance model validation underscore need careful planning thoroughness accuracy input data collection program purpose
Efforts made ensure collected data consistent expected value
For example traffic analysis typical traffic engineer perform site visit verify traffic count become familiar traffic pattern area
The resulting model forecast better data used model estimation validation

The term used various context
For example enterprise process model often referred
Process model nature classified together model
Thus process model description process type level
Since process model type level process instantiation
The process model used repeatedly development many application thus many instantiation
One possible use process model prescribe thing done contrast process really happens
A process model roughly anticipation process look like
What process shall determined actual system development
The goal process model From theoretical point view explains key concept needed describe happens development process happens
From operational point view modeling aimed providing guidance method engineer application developer
The activity process usually predicate need change process identify issue corrected
This transformation may may require IT involvement although common driver need model business process
programme desired put process practice
With advance technology larger platform vendor vision business process model BPM becoming fully executable capable engineering coming closer reality every day
Supporting technology include UML
Process modeling address process aspect enterprise leading encompassing
The relationship business process context rest enterprise system data organizational structure strategy etc
create greater capability analyzing planning change
One example corporate understanding process company detail allowing management identify redundancy resulting smoother merger
Process modeling always key aspect continuous improvement approach seen
There five type coverage term process model defined differently Processes different kind
These definition correspond various way process modelled
refers level detail process model affect kind guidance explanation trace provided
Coarse granularity restricts rather limited level detail whereas fine granularity provides detailed capability
The nature granularity needed dependent situation hand
Project manager customer representative general middle management require rather process description want gain overview time budget resource planning decision
In contrast software engineer user tester analyst software system architect prefer process model detail model provide instruction important execution dependency dependency people
While notation model exist traditional process model description
Process model ideally provide wide range granularity
Process Weaver
It found process model prescriptive actual practice departure prescription occur
Thus framework adopting method evolved system development method match specific organizational situation thereby improve usefulness
The development framework also called situational
Method construction approach organized flexibility spectrum ranging
Lying end spectrum rigid method whereas end modular method construction
Rigid method completely leave little scope adapting situation hand
On hand modular method modified augmented fit given situation
Selecting rigid method allows project choose method panel rigid method whereas selecting path within method consists choosing appropriate path situation hand
Finally selecting tuning method allows project select method different approach tune project need
As quality process model discussed paper need elaborate quality modeling technique important essence quality process model
In existing framework created understanding quality line quality modeling technique quality model result application technique clearly drawn
This report concentrate quality process modeling technique quality process model clearly differentiate two
Various framework developed help understanding quality process modeling technique one example Quality based modeling evaluation framework known framework argued provide set well defined quality property procedure make objective assessment property possible
This framework also advantage providing uniform formal description model element within one different model type using one modeling technique In short make assessment product quality process quality modeling technique regard set property defined
Quality property relate technique discussed To ass quality framework used illustrate quality dynamic essential modeling organisation DEMO business modeling technique
It stated evaluation framework DEMO modeling technique revealed shortcoming
One particular include quantifiable metric express quality business modeling technique make hard compare quality different technique overall rating
There also systematic approach quality measurement modeling technique known complexity metric suggested Rossi et al

Techniques Meta model used basis computation complexity metric
In comparison quality framework proposed quality measurement focus technical level instead individual model level
Authors Cardoso Mendling Neuman Reijers used complexity metric measure simplicity understandability design
This supported later research done Mendling argued without using quality metric help question quality property model simple process modeled complex unsuitable way
This turn lead lower understandability higher maintenance cost perhaps inefficient execution process question
The quality modeling technique important creating model quality contribute correctness usefulness model
Earliest process model reflected dynamic process practical process obtained instantiation term relevant concept available technology specific implementation environment process constraint
Enormous number research done quality model le focus shifted towards quality process model
Quality issue process model evaluated exhaustively however four main guideline framework practice
These quality framework metric related quality aspect empirical survey related modeling technique pragmatic guideline
Hommes quoted Wang main characteristic quality model grouped group namely correctness usefulness model correctness range model correspondence phenomenon modeled correspondence syntactical rule modeling also independent purpose model used
Whereas usefulness seen model helpful specific purpose hand model constructed first place
Hommes also make distinction internal correctness empirical syntactical semantic quality external correctness validity
A common starting point defining quality conceptual model look linguistic property modeling language syntax semantics often applied
Also broader approach based semiotics rather linguistic done Krogstie using quality framework known SEQUAL
It defines several quality aspect based relationship model knowledge Externalisation domain modeling language activity learning taking action modeling
The framework however provide way determine various degree quality used extensively business process modeling empirical test carried According previous research done Moody use conceptual model quality framework proposed Lindland evaluate quality process model three level quality identified From research noticed quality framework found easy use useful evaluating quality process model however limitation regard reliability difficult identify defect
These limitation led refinement framework subsequent research done
This framework called SEQUEL framework Krogstie Refined Krogstie Jørgensen included three quality aspect
Dimensions Conceptual Quality framework Modeling Domain set statement relevant correct describing problem domain Language Extension set statement possible given grammar vocabulary modeling language used
Model Externalization conceptual representation problem domain
It defined set statement problem domain actually made
Social Actor Interpretation Technical Actor Interpretation set statement actor human model user tool interact model respectively conceptual representation problem domain contains
Finally Participant Knowledge set statement human actor involved modeling process believe made represent problem domain
These quality dimension later divided two group deal physical social aspect model
In later work Krogstie et al
stated extension SEQUAL framework fixed limitation initial framework however limitation remain
In particular framework static view upon semantic quality mainly considering model modeling activity comparing model static domain rather seeing model facilitator changing domain
Also framework definition pragmatic quality quite narrow focusing understanding line semiotics Morris newer research linguistics semiotics focused beyond mere understanding model used affect interpreter
The need dynamic view semiotic quality framework particularly evident considering process model often prescribe even enact action problem domain hence change model may also change problem domain directly
This paper discus quality framework relation active process model suggests revised framework based
Further work Krogstie revise SEQUAL framework appropriate active process model redefining physical quality narrow interpretation previous research
The framework use Guidelines Modeling GoM based general accounting principle include six principle Correctness Clarity deal comprehensibility explicitness System description model system
Comprehensibility relates graphical arrangement information object therefore support understand ability model
Relevance relates model situation presented
Comparability involves ability compare model semantic comparison two model Economic efficiency produced cost design process need least covered proposed use cost cutting revenue increase
Since purpose organization case maximization profit principle defines borderline modeling process
The last principle Systematic design defines accepted differentiation diverse view within modeling
Correctness relevance economic efficiency prerequisite quality model must fulfilled remaining guideline optional necessary
The two framework SEQUAL GOM limitation use used people competent modeling
They provide major quality metric easily applicable
The use metric related quality aspect process model trying bridge gap use two framework modeling mostly theoretical empirical test carried support use
Most experiment carried relate relationship metric quality aspect work done individually different author Canfora et al
study connection mainly count metric example number task split maintainability software process model Cardoso validates correlation control flow complexity perceived complexity Mendling et al
use metric predict control flow error deadlock process model
The result reveal increase size model appears reduce quality comprehensibility
Further work Mendling et al
investigates connection metric understanding While metric confirmed regarding effect also personal factor modeler like competence revealed important understanding model
Several empirical survey carried still give clear guideline way evaluating quality process model necessary clear set guideline guide modeler task
Pragmatic guideline proposed different practitioner even though difficult provide exhaustive account guideline practice
In tip process modeling summarized many technical definition rule provided teach create process model effective primary mission maximizing shared understanding process
Most guideline easily put practice label activity rule suggested practitioner analyzed empirically
From research
value process model dependent choice graphical construct also annotation textual label need analyzed
It found result better model term understanding alternative labelling style
From earlier research way evaluate process model quality seen process model size structure expertise modeler modularity affect overall comprehensibility
Based set guideline presented Process Modeling Guidelines
This guideline us style well guideline number element model application structured modeling decomposition process model
The guideline follows still though limitation use Validity problem relate content process model way content organized represented
It suggest way organizing different structure process model content kept intact pragmatic issue must included model still left
The second limitation relates prioritizing guideline derived ranking small empirical basis relies involvement process modeler
This could seen one hand need wider involvement process modeler experience also rise question alternative approach may available arrive prioritizing guideline

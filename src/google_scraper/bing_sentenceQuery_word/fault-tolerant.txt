system designed compensate multiple failure
Such system automatically detect failure subsystem memory card power supply network component
The failure point identified component procedure immediately take place loss service
To ensure fault tolerance enterprise need purchase inventory formatted computer equipment secondary device
The goal prevent key system network focusing issue related
Fault tolerance provided embedded combination two
In software implementation operating system provides allows programmer critical data predetermined point within transaction
In hardware implementation example Stratus Virtual Operating System programmer need aware capability machine
At hardware level fault tolerance achieved hardware component
mirrored
Multiple processor lockstepped together output compared correctness
When anomaly occurs faulty component determined taken service machine continues function usual
Fault tolerance closely associated maintaining via computer system network
environment defined restore service instantaneously following service outage whereas environment strives operational service
In set independent server coupled loosely together guarantee sharing critical data resource
The cluster monitor health provide fault recovery ensure application remain available
Conversely cluster consists multiple physical system share single copy computer OS
Software command issued one system also executed system
The tradeoff fault tolerance high availability cost
Systems integrated fault tolerance incur higher cost due inclusion additional hardware
Fault tolerance often used synonymously although latter aligned holistic discipline aim detect isolate resolve problem
A system swap backup componentry maintain high level system availability performance
Graceful degradation allows system continue operation albeit reduced state performance
Fault tolerance hinge
Namely information redundantly protected via data
For physical redundancy extra hardware equipment remains standby operational system
Data backup frequently combined redundancy
Both strategy intended safeguard data loss although backup tends focus including granular data
Redundant system engineered specifically application tolerate little downtime
When implementing fault tolerance enterprise match requirement appropriate level data protection redundant array independent disk
The RAID technique ensures data written multiple balance operation boost overall system performance
Organizations prioritize fault tolerance speed performance would best served disk mirroring combine disk mirroring
If fault tolerance system performance equally important enterprise may find worthwhile spend little extra money combining RAID tolerates loss two disk failure data lost
Aside higher cost drawback data writes occur slowly RAID set
Aside hardware architecture coordinated regularly scheduled backup critical data perhaps including mirrored copy secondary alternate location

property enables continue operating properly event failure one fault within component
If operating quality decrease decrease proportional severity failure compared naively designed system even small failure cause total breakdown
Fault tolerance particularly sought
The ability maintaining functionality portion system break referred
A enables system continue intended operation possibly reduced level rather failing completely part system
The term commonly used describe designed continue le fully operational perhaps reduction increase event partial failure
That system whole stopped due problem either
An example another field motor vehicle designed continue drivable one tire punctured structure able retain integrity presence damage due cause manufacturing flaw impact
Within scope system fault tolerance achieved anticipating exceptional condition building system cope general aiming system converges towards state
However consequence system failure catastrophic cost making sufficiently reliable high better solution may use form duplication
In case consequence system failure catastrophic system must able use reversion fall back safe mode
This similar recovery human action human present loop
A highly system might continue level performance even though one component failed
For example building backup electrical generator provide voltage wall outlet even grid power fails
A system designed whether function reduced level fails completely way protects people property data injury damage intrusion disclosure
In computer program might executing opposed uncontrolled crash order prevent data corruption experiencing error
A similar distinction made failing well
opposite strategy used weapon system designed kill injure target even part system damaged destroyed
A system designed experience used computing similar fail safe operates reduced level performance component failure
For example building may operate lighting reduced level elevator reduced speed grid power fails rather either trapping people dark completely continuing operate full power
In computing example graceful degradation insufficient network bandwidth available stream online video version might streamed place version
example computing web page available basic functional format older web browser enhanced version browser capable handling additional technology larger display available
In program considered designed continue operation despite error exception invalid input instead crashing completely
opposite robustness
continue transmit data despite failure link node likewise expected prevent complete failure situation like earthquake flood collision
A system high alert user component failure occurred even continues operate full performance failure repaired imminent complete failure anticipated
Likewise component designed report first point failure rather allow downstream component fail generate report
This allows easier diagnosis underlying problem may prevent improper operation broken state
Redundancy provision functional capability would unnecessary environment
This consist backup component automatically kick one component fail
For example large cargo truck lose tire without major consequence
They many tire one tire critical exception front tire used steer generally carry le load total four le likely fail
The idea incorporating redundancy order improve reliability system pioneered
Two kind redundancy possible space redundancy time redundancy
Space redundancy provides additional component function data item unnecessary operation
Space redundancy classified hardware software information redundancy depending type redundant resource added system
In time redundancy computation data transmission repeated result compared stored copy previous result
The current terminology kind testing referred Service Fault Tolerance Testing ISFTT short
Providing design every component normally option
Associated redundancy brings number penalty increase weight size power consumption cost well time design verify test
Therefore number choice examined determine component fault tolerant An example component pass test car occupant restraint system
While normally think occupant restraint system
If vehicle roll undergoes severe primary method occupant restraint may fail
Restraining occupant accident absolutely critical safety pas first test
Accidents causing occupant ejection quite common pas second test
The cost redundant restraint method like seat belt quite low economically term weight space pas third test
Therefore adding seat belt vehicle excellent idea
Other supplemental restraint system expensive pas test smaller margin
Another excellent example principle put practice braking system whilst actual brake mechanism critical particularly prone sudden rather progressive failure case necessarily duplicated allow even balanced application brake force wheel
It would also prohibitively costly main component would add considerable weight
However similarly critical system actuating brake driver control inherently le robust generally using cable rust stretch jam snap hydraulic fluid leak boil develop bubble absorb water thus lose effectiveness
Thus modern car footbrake hydraulic brake circuit diagonally divided give two smaller point failure loss either reducing brake power causing much dangerous brakeforce imbalance straight split hydraulic circuit fail completely relatively rare occurrence failsafe form parking brake operates otherwise relatively weak rear brake still bring vehicle safe halt conjunction braking long demand line normal traffic flow
The culmulatively unlikely combination total footbrake failure need harsh braking emergency likely result collision still one lower speed would otherwise case
In comparison footpedal activated service brake parking brake le critical item unless used backup footbrake cause immediate danger found nonfunctional moment application
Therefore redundancy built per se typically us cheaper lighter le hardwearing cable actuation system suffice happens hill use footbrake momentarily hold vehicle still driving find flat piece road stop
Alternatively shallow gradient transmission shifted Park Reverse First gear transmission lock engine compression used hold stationary need include sophistication first bring halt
On motorcycle similar level provided simpler method firstly front rear brake system entirely separate regardless method activation cable rod hydraulic allowing one fail entirely whilst leaving unaffected
Secondly rear brake relatively strong compared automotive cousin even powerful disc sport model even though usual intent front system provide vast majority braking force overall vehicle weight central rear tyre generally larger grippier rider lean back put weight therefore allowing brake force applied wheel lock
On cheaper slower machine even front wheel use hydraulic disc extra brake force easier packaging rear usually primitive somewhat inefficient exceptionally robust drum thanks ease connecting footpedal wheel way importantly near impossibility catastrophic failure even rest machine like lot bike first year use point collapse neglected maintenance
The basic characteristic fault tolerance require In addition system characterized term planned service outage unplanned service outage
These usually measured application level hardware level
The figure merit called expressed percentage
For example system would statistically provide availability
system typically based concept redundancy
Spare component address first fundamental characteristic fault tolerance three way All implementation except RAID example us
A machine us replicated element operating parallel
At time replication element state
The input provided output expected
The output replication compared using voting circuit
A machine two replication element termed DMR
The voting circuit detect mismatch recovery relies method
A machine three replication element termed TMR
The voting circuit determine replication error vote observed
In case voting circuit output correct result discard erroneous version
After internal state erroneous replication assumed different two voting circuit switch DMR mode
This model applied larger number replication
machine easily made fully gate replication making state transition edge clock clock replication exactly phase
However possible build lockstep system without requirement
Bringing replication synchrony requires making internal stored state
They started fixed initial state reset state
Alternatively internal state one replica copied another replica
One variant DMR
Two replicated element operate lockstep pair voting circuit detects mismatch operation output signal indicating error
Another pair operates exactly way
A final circuit selects output pair proclaim error
requires four replica rather three TMR used commercially
design advantage obvious many disadvantage Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires broken part taken replaced new part system still operational computing known
Such system implemented single backup known represents vast majority system
In system long enough operator time fix broken device backup also fails
It help time failure long possible specifically required system
Fault tolerance notably successful computer application
built entire business machine used tolerance create system measured year
architecture may encompass also computer software example process
Data format may also designed degrade gracefully
example designed allowing new HTML entity ignored understand without causing document unusable
There difference fault tolerance system rarely problem
For instance system failure rate two hour per forty year therefore highly
But fault occur still stopped operating completely therefore

system designed around concept
In essence must able continue working level satisfaction presence fault
Fault tolerance property individual machine may also characterise rule interact
For example TCP designed allow reliable communication even presence communication link imperfect overloaded
It requiring endpoint communication packet loss duplication reordering corruption condition damage data integrity reduce throughput proportional amount
Recovery error system characterised either
When system detects made error recovery take system state time corrects able move forward
recovery reverts system state back earlier correct version example using move forward
recovery requires operation checkpoint detected erroneous state made
Some system make use recovery different error different part one error
Most designed handle several possible failure including fault failure failure temporary permanent failure error interface error hardware software including failure operator error erroneous keystroke bad command sequence installing unexpected software physical damage flaw introduced system outside source
Hardware common application system designed prevent failure due hardware component
Most basically provided particularly
Typically component multiple backup separated smaller segment act contain fault extra redundancy built physical connector power supply fan etc
There special software instrumentation package designed detect failure fault masking way ignore fault seamlessly preparing backup component execute something soon instruction sent using sort voting protocol main backup give result flawed output ignored
Software based around nullifying programming error using redundancy static emergency subprogram fill program crash
There many way conduct depending application available hardware
The first known computer built
Its basic design connected via relay voting method detection
Several machine developed along line mostly military use
Eventually separated three distinct category machine would last long time without maintenance one used computer dependable required constant monitoring used monitor control experiment finally computer high amount runtime would heavy use many supercomputer used monitoring
Most development LLNM Long Life No Maintenance computing done NASA preparation research aspect
NASA first machine went second attempt JSTAR computer used
This computer backup memory array use memory recovery method thus called JPL computer
It could detect error fix bring redundant module needed
The computer still working today
computer pioneered mostly manufacturer company USA
These needed computer massive amount uptime would enough fault allow continued operation relying fact computer output would constantly monitored human detect fault
Again IBM developed first computer kind NASA guidance rocket later built
The redundancy
In general early effort design focused mainly internal diagnosis fault would indicate something failing worker could replace
SAPO instance method faulty memory drum would emit noise failure
Later effort showed fully effective system diagnosing isolating fault implementing redundant backup alerting need repair
This known redundancy fault cause automatic fail safe warning operator still common form level one design use today
Voting another initial method discussed multiple redundant backup operating constantly checking result outcome example four component reported answer one component reported answer four would vote fifth component faulty taken service
This called M N majority voting
Historically motion always move M N due fact complexity system difficulty ensuring transitive state disrupt operation
among first company specializing design computer system
The important requirement design computer system making sure actually meet requirement reliability
This done using various failure model simulate various failure analyzing well system reacts
These complex involving probability curve specific fault rate curve error rate like
The commonly used model HARP SAVE SHARPE USA SURF LASS Europe
Research kind tolerance needed critical system involves large amount interdisciplinary work
The complex system carefully possible interaction considered prepared
Considering importance system transport military field topic touch research wide include obvious subject reliability arcane element model formal exclusionary logic remote
technique enables continue executing despite
The technique handle attempt read invalid memory returning manufactured value program turn make use manufactured value ignores former value tried access
This great contrast inform program error abort program
In computing attempt made inform program error occurred
The approach performance cost technique rewrite code insert dynamic check address validity execution time increase
Recovery shepherding lightweight technique enable software program recover otherwise fatal error null pointer dereference divide zero
Comparing failure oblivious computing technique recovery shepherding work compiled program binary directly need recompile program
It us framework
It attache application process error occurs repair execution track repair effect execution continues contains repair effect within application process detaches process repair effect flushed process state
It interfere normal execution program therefore incurs negligible overhead
For systematically collected real world error prototype implementation enables application continue execute provide acceptable output service user input

Fault tolerance way operating system OS responds hardware software failure
The term essentially refers system ability allow failure malfunction ability may provided software hardware combination
To handle fault gracefully computer system two duplicate system
Fault tolerance software may part OS interface allowing programmer check critical data specific point transaction
Fault tolerance include In general fault tolerance never achieved due cost constraint

Remember old Federal Express slogan When absolutely positively overnight
That lot like demand today computer system except need overnight delivery nonstop operation regardless problem individual hardware software component power failure kind disaster
The term concept fault tolerance built software come part hardware provided combination two
financial service airline used configuration protect vital core application several year
But globalization increasingly driving demand continuous level service availability across distributed environment well
Vendors market include Stratus Computer Systems Maynard Mass
Compaq Computer NonStop Himalaya system IBM SP system Boxborough Marathon Technologies vendor configuration Windows NT system
It important distinguish fault tolerance high term often confused analyst say
Both configuration designed maximize application system availability
Both use backup mirrored server fundamental approach recovering failure
But goal configuration help firm recover quickly crash good enough fault continuous availability seek eliminate recovery time completely
The emphasis application takeover merely new server
There qualitative quantitative difference two say Jean Bozman analyst International Data Framingham Mass
With fault tolerance talking five minute le downtime year
With high availability time vary quite bit depending configuration according Bozman
Fault tolerance true redundancy physical level component fail nobody know even second say Gary Collins manager computer operation Toys Pittsfield Mass
As result system configuration feature high degree hardware redundancy serviceability remote management capability
All main hardware CPUs memory duplicated
All redundant component execute process lockstep
Replicated component perform instruction time even one fail application would keep running without change
As result administrator add capacity run routine maintenance remove failed component without taking whole system
You talking two system running load time
In case one fails lose anything Bozman say
Compaq NonStop Himalaya server provide one example
The system composed cluster memory copy operating tandem completely independent one another
The server use concept called process pair consists primary process backup process run separate processor
The backup process mirror information primary process able instantly take case primary processor failure
Hardened operating system onboard diagnostic tool sophisticated software complement redundancy
Among thing software designed prevent loss data failure manage task forced switchovers failed system
The goal detect hardware problem shut system quickly redistribute workload system
Stratus software instance monitor use CPU memory disk resource constantly compare threshold
The system capable alerting administrator vendor directly case impending failure
Such capability critical Direct Services say Mischa Weisz president CEO Etobicoke company
As provider processing authorization service retailer financial institution Weisz explains need platform without question
The company environment largely based Stratus technology delivers near system availability annually according Weisz
To fault tolerance mean something happens one place hardware supporting software capable seamlessly transporting application another place continuous service Weisz say
This architecture used Marathon Technologies ensure fault tolerance Windows NT network Jaikumar Vijayan freelance technology writer specializing computer security privacy topic

Fault tolerance cloud computing largely conceptually private hosted environment
Meaning simply mean ability infrastructure continue providing service underlying application even failure one component piece layer
In cloud computing autoscaling datacenter across geographic zone
You still need configure facility infrastructure use continue function failure maintenance
Your build orchestration engine example may monitor number user connection session seeing exceed available resource whether resource exceeded sheer volume OR failure one previously healthy component spin additional resource locally remotely continue servicing load
Fault tolerance ability provide service acceptable level event failure
In cloud computing definition stay
However based service using Infrastructure Service Platform Service Container Services Software Service role handling fault tolerance change
After entering question Google search textbox I found The dynamic environment cloud result various unexpected fault failure

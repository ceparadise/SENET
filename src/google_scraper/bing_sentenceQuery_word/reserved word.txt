In also known word used name variable function reserved use
This definition reserved word may meaning
A closely related often conflated notion word special meaning particular context
This definition
By contrast name built language considered reserved word keywords
The term reserved word keyword often used interchangeably one may say reserved word reserved use keyword formal use varies language language article distinguish
In general reserved word keywords need coincide modern language keywords subset reserved word make parsing easier since keywords confused identifier
In language like C Python reserved word keywords coincide language like Java keywords reserved word reserved word keywords reserved future use
In yet language older language keywords reserved word keywords distinguished identifier mean
This make parsing difficult parser necessary
The set reserved word keywords language often coincide almost equal distinction subtle term often used interchangeably
However careful usage distinguished
Making keywords reserved word make easier string character unambiguously either keyword identifier without depending context thus keywords usually subset reserved word
However reserved word need keywords example Java reserved word meaning appear production rule grammar
This usually done reserved word may become keyword future version without breaking existing program
Conversely keywords need reserved word role understood context may distinguished another manner
For example phrase unambiguous grammar since control statement clause start thus allowed language
Alternatively keywords must stropped marked way distinguished strict language listing bold thus reserved word
Thus strict language following expression legal bold keyword conflict ordinary identifier However ALGOL also stropping regime keywords reserved word example distinct concept often coincide followed many modern language
A reserved word one look like normal word allowed used normal word
Formally mean satisfies usual syntax word identifier example sequence letter used identifier used
For example word commonly reserved word generally valid assignment
Keywords varied us primarily fall class part phrase grammar specifically various meaning often used word procedural language indicates take clause nonterminal symbol name primitive type language support primitive value Boolean true sometimes special command like
Other us keywords phrase
The distinct definition clear language analyzed combination lexer parser syntax language generated word phrase
This common analyzing modern language case keywords subset reserved word must distinguished identifier word level hence reserved word syntactically analyzed differently phrase level keywords
In case reserved word defined part lexical grammar tokenized separate type distinct identifier
In conventional notation reserved word example tokenized type respectively tokenized type
Keywords contrast syntactically appear phrase grammar
For example production rule conditional expression may
In case terminal symbol meaning token type respectively due lexical grammar mean string original source
As example primitive constant value may keyword representing boolean value true case appear grammar possible expansion production instance
Beyond reserving specific list word language reserve entire range word use private space future language version different dialect compiler extension internal use compiler notably
This often done using prefix often one
C notable respect reserve identifier start two underscore underscore followed uppercase letter reserve identifier start single underscore ordinary tag space use reserve identifier contain double underscore anywhere allows use double underscore separator connect user identifier instance
The frequent use double underscore internal identifier Python gave rise abbreviation coined independently Tim Hochberg within minute reply question
The list reserved word keywords language defined language developed form part language formal specification
Generally one wish minimize number reserved word avoid restricting valid identifier name
Further introducing new reserved word break existing program use word backwards compatible avoided
To prevent provide sometimes word reserved without current use reserved word keyword allows word used future without breaking existing program
Alternatively new language feature implemented predefineds overridden thus breaking existing program
Reasons flexibility include allowing compiler vendor extend specification including feature different standard dialect language extend future version language include additional feature
For example procedural language may anticipate adding capability future version dialect point one might add keywords like
To accommodate possibility current specification may make reserved word even currently used
A notable example reserved word meaning Java also used identifier
By reserving term implemented future version Java desired without breaking older Java source code
For example proposal add language possible using word since reserved currently unused however proposal rejected notably even though adding feature would break existing program using standard library notably collection break compatibility
also contains number reserved word without special functionality exact list varies version mode
Languages differ significantly frequently introduce new reserved word keywords name language conservative introducing new keywords rarely never avoid breaking existing program language introduce new keywords freely requiring existing program change existing identifier conflict
A case study given new keywords compared recall C identifier begin underscore followed uppercase letter reserved The C committee prefers create new keywords user name space generally expected revision C avoid breaking older C program
By comparison committee prefers make new keywords old keywords
For example defines new keyword designate static storage local one thread
defines new keyword In new header macro definition provide name That introduced keyword within existing set reserved word certain prefix used separate facility macro processing allow use new keyword without prefixing introduce keyword despite existing reserved word breaking program used without requiring macro processing
A related notion reserved word predefined function method subroutine variable particularly standard library
These similar part basic language may used similar purpose
However differ name predefined function method subroutine typically categorized identifier instead reserved word treated specially syntactic analysis
Further reserved word may redefined programmer predefineds often overridden capacity
Languages vary provided keyword predefined
Some language instance provide keywords operation whereas others library routine
In version earlier many dialect keyword
In contrast C Lisp Python equivalent function standard library
Similarly Python prior predefined variable reserved word Python made reserved word
Some use term keyword reserved word interchangeably others distinguish usage say using keyword mean word special certain context reserved word mean special word used name
The meaning keywords indeed meaning notion differs widely language language
Concretely ALGOL keywords stropped strict language written bold reserved word unstropped word used ordinary identifier
The Specification us term keyword
The ISO standard us term keyword
In many language similar environment like reserved word identifies syntactic form
Words used construct keywords
In language keywords also used name variable function
In language keywords written verbatim must
This mean keywords must marked somehow

quoting prefixing special character
As consequence keywords reserved word thus word used normal identifier
However one stropping regime strope keywords instead simply reserved word
Some language extremely liberal approach allowing core keywords redefined specific purpose
In term keyword keyword symbol used special sort identifier
Unlike symbol usually stand variable function keywords package
Keywords usually used label named argument function represent symbolic value
The symbol name function variable special form macro package named basically reserved word
The effect redefining undefined ANSI Common Lisp
Binding possible
For instance expression possible local variable
The leftmost refers operator remaining symbol interpreted variable name
Since separate namespace function variable could local variable
In Common Lisp however two special symbol keyword package symbol
When evaluated expression evaluate
They used name function variable de facto reserved
expression operator permit usage
Typically programmer attempt use keyword variable function name compilation error triggered
In modern editor keywords automatically set particular text colour remind inform programmer keywords
In language control flow construct implemented macro function
In language without expressive feature generally keywords
Not language number reserved word
For example Java derivative rather sparse complement reserved whereas approximately
At end spectrum pure none
The number reserved word language little powerful language
COBOL designed business language made using structural element verb clause sentence section division
C hand written terse syntactically get text screen
For example compare equivalent block code C COBOL calculate weekly earnings Pure Prolog logic expressed term relation execution triggered running query relation
Constructs loop implemented using recursive relationship
All three language solve type problem even though differing number reserved word
This power relates belonging set language
Definition reserved word language raise problem
The language may difficult new user learn long list reserved word memorize ca used identifier
It may difficult extend language addition reserved word new feature might invalidate existing program conversely overloading existing reserved word new meaning confusing
Porting program problematic word reserved one might reserved another
Microsoft specification allows code written different programming language combined together final product
Because word collision occur code implemented one language try execute code written another language
For example library may contain definition If compiled distributed part toolbox programmer wishing define variable type would encounter problem reserved word C
Thus following compile C A similar issue arises accessing member overriding virtual method identifying namespaces
This resolved
In order work around issue specification allows programmer C place identifier force considered identifier rather reserved word compiler For consistency usage also permitted setting local variable parameter name private member

A may refer following Often found programming language macro term phrase appropriated special use may utilized creation name
For example print reserved word function many language show text screen
used operating system method identifying device file service
Below listing Microsoft reserved word Windows operating system
When attempting use reserved word name file command may encounter unusual response
For example attempting save file CON may generate reserved file name access denied error say file already exists

What difference
For example one read following statement special meaning language part syntax
word used identifier variable function etc
reserved language
In practice keywords reserved word vice versa
But two different thing may happen keyword reserved word
keyword meaning special context therefore used identifier reserved word keyword
reserved future use
Update Some example given others illustrate distinction Just show distinction meaningful Not language keywords reserved word
In Fortran possible In case keywords reserved depending context interpreted compiler variable
A good example distinction goto Java
It language keyword
valid Java reserved word
It seems java designer telling u We going use neither
Wiki say A keyword word special certain context reserved word special word used name
I guess keyword word used keyword like switch etc reserved word something use variable name might become keyword future version language
Really depend lot context
For example ISO Standard say thing like int etc
actually use term except footnote something else probably meant The standard doe specify example name begin underscore uppercase letter reserved name
Keywords Keywords special functionality compiler
So keywords used identifier coding
Reserved word Reserve word word reserved future use
In java const goto reserved word used currently may brought back java future
If check Java Language Keywords It say java latest I guess keywords including goto const
So goto const keywords reserved
Reserved word keywords mostly meaning us used purpose Basic
Keywords used variable name
Some keywords Basic word special meaning particular
It definition
word used variable function name
It definition
Java keywords reserved word
Probably reverse
goto reserved word used function
In older language like FORTRAN keywords reserved word
However keyword reserved word used interchangeably

In natural unit data used particular design
A word handled unit hardware processor
The number word important characteristic specific processor design
The size word reflected many aspect computer structure operation majority processor usually word sized largest piece data transferred single operation word many architecture
The largest possible size used designate location memory typically hardware word hardware word mean natural word processor opposed definition used
Modern processor including usually word size modern general purpose computer usually use bit
Special purpose digital processor instance may use size many size used historically including bit
The example system earlier word size
Several earliest computer modern well used rather plain typically word size decimal digit early fixed word length
The size word sometimes differ expected due earlier computer
If multiple compatible variation family processor share common architecture instruction set differ word size documentation software may become notationally complex accommodate difference see
Depending computer organized unit may used When computer architecture designed choice word size substantial importance
There design consideration encourage particular size particular us
address consideration point different size different us
However consideration economy design strongly push one size size related multiple fraction submultiples primary size
That preferred size becomes word size architecture
size past one influence unit address resolution choice word size
Before character often stored six bit allowed character alphabet limited upper case
Since efficient time space word size multiple character size word size period usually multiple bit binary machine
A common choice also good size numeric property floating point format
After introduction design used character supported letter standard size character accurately became eight bit
Word size thereafter naturally multiple eight bit bit commonly used
Early machine design included used often termed
In type organization numeric operand fixed length rather end detected character special marking often called encountered
Such machine often used number
This class machine included
Most machine work one unit memory time since instruction datum several unit long instruction take several cycle access memory
These machine often quite slow
For example instruction fetch take cycle read digit instruction reduced cycle cycle instruction need address field
Instruction execution took completely variable number cycle depending size operand
The memory model architecture strongly influenced word size
In particular resolution memory address smallest unit designated address often chosen word
In approach address value differ one designate adjacent memory word
This natural machine deal almost always word unit advantage allowing instruction use minimally sized field contain address permit smaller instruction size larger variety instruction
When byte processing significant part workload usually advantageous use rather word unit address resolution
This allows arbitrary character within character string addressed straightforwardly
A word still addressed address used requires bit alternative
The word size need integer multiple character size organization
This addressing approach used IBM common approach machine designed since
Individual byte accessed machine one two way
Bytes manipulated combination shift mask operation register
Moving single byte one arbitrary location another may require equivalent following Alternatively many machine implement byte operation instruction using special register memory
For example byte pointer contained size byte bit allowing byte accessed bit position byte within word word address data
Instructions could automatically adjust pointer next byte example load deposit store operation
Different amount memory used store data value different degree precision
The commonly used size usually multiple unit address resolution byte word
Converting index item array address item requires operation rather multiplication
In case relationship also avoid use division operation
As result modern computer design word size operand size power two time size byte
As computer design grown complex central importance single word size architecture decreased
Although capable hardware use wider variety size data market force exert pressure maintain extending processor capability
As result might central word size fresh design coexist alternative size original word size backward compatible design
The original word size remains available future design forming basis size family
In designed successor
They used quantity referred quantity
This contrast earlier machine natural unit addressing memory would called quantity one half word would called
In fitting scheme VAX bit
Another example family processor three different word length later released
As software routinely one next documentation define refer older thus shorter full word length CPU software may compiled
Also similar byte used small number many program shorter word bit may used context range wider word needed especially save considerable stack space cache memory space
For example Microsoft maintains definition bit despite fact API may used processor standard word size would bit respectively
Data structure containing different sized word refer byte byte byte respectively
A similar phenomenon developed support various size backward compatibility instruction set instruction mnemonic carry q identifier denoting term architecture original word size
In general new processor must use data word length virtual address width older processor older processor
Often carefully written source code written mind recompiled run variety processor even one different data word length different address width

A transforms computer code written one source language another programming language target language
Compilers type support digital device primarily computer
The name primarily used program translate create program
However many different type compiler
If compiled program run computer whose different one compiler run compiler
A written language compiled
A program translates higher level one
A program translates language usually called transpiler
A language usually program translates form expression without change language
The term refers tool used create parser perform syntax analysis
A compiler likely perform many following operation conversion input program
Compilers implement operation phase promote efficient design correct transformation source input target output
Program fault caused incorrect compiler behavior difficult track work around therefore compiler implementers invest significant effort ensure
Compilers translator used transform source program
An computer software transforms executes indicated operation
The translation process influence design computer language lead preference compilation interpretation
In practice interpreter implemented compiled language compiler implemented interpreted language
Theoretical computing concept developed scientist mathematician engineer formed basis digital computing development World War II
Primitive binary language evolved digital device understand one zero circuit pattern underlying machine architecture
In late forty assembly language created offer workable abstraction computer architecture
Limited capacity early computer led substantial technical challenge first compiler designed
Therefore compilation process needed divided several small program
The front end program produce analysis product used back end program generate target code
As computer technology provided resource compiler design could align better compilation process
The human mind design better solution language move machine higher level
So development language follows naturally capability offered digital computer
language strictly defined syntax semantics form language architecture
Elements formal language include The sentence language may defined set rule called grammar
BNF describes syntax sentence language used syntax Algol
The idea derive concept linguist
BNF extension become standard tool describing syntax programming notation many case part compiler generated automatically BNF description
In designed algorithmic programming language called Plan Calculus
While actual implementation occurred presented concept later seen designed Ken Iverson late
APL language mathematical computation
language design formative year digital computing provided useful programming tool variety application Compiler technology evolved need strictly defined transformation source program target target program digital computer
The compiler could viewed front end deal analysis source code back end synthesize analysis target code
Optimization front end back end could produce efficient target code
Some early milestone development compiler technology Early operating system system software written assembly language
In early language system programming still controversial due resource limitation
Still several research industry effort began shift toward system programming language example
Basic Combined Programming Language designed University Cambridge originally developed compiler writing tool
Several compiler implemented Richards book provides insight language compiler
BCPL influential system programming language still used research also provided basis design B C language
Basic Language Implementation System Software developed Digital Equipment Corporation DEC computer
Wulf Carnegie Mellon University CMU research team
The CMU team went develop compiler one year later
Multiplexed Information Computing Service operating system project involved later led MIT
Multics written language developed IBM IBM User Group
IBM goal satisfy business scientific system programming requirement
There language could considered offered complete solution even though implemented
For first year Mulitics project subset language could compiled assembly language Early EPL compiler Doug McIlory Bob Morris Bell Labs
EPL supported project compiler full could developed
Bell Labs left Multics project Over time hope replaced frustration group effort initially failed produce economically useful system
Continued participation would drive project support cost
So researcher turned development effort
A system programming language based BCPL concept written
Ritchie created compiler B wrote Uniplexed Information Computing Service operating system Unics eventually became spelled Unix
Bell Labs started development expansion based B BCPL
The BCPL compiler transported Multics Bell Labs BCPL preferred language Bell Labs
Initially program Bell Labs B compiler used C compiler developed
In new provided resource define extension B rewrite compiler
By design C language essentially complete Unix kernel rewritten Steve Johnson started development Portable C Compiler PCC support retargeting C compiler new machine
OOP offered interesting possibility application development maintenance
OOP concept go back part language science
At Bell Labs development became interested OOP
first used system programming
The initial design leveraged C language system programming capability Simula concept
facility added
The Cfront program implemented language compiler
In subsequent year several compiler developed popularity grew
In many application domain idea using language quickly caught
Because expanding functionality supported newer increasing complexity computer architecture compiler became complex
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency sponsored compiler project Wulf CMU research team
The Production Quality design would produce Production Quality Compiler PQC formal definition source language target
PQCC tried extend term beyond traditional meaning parser generator without much success
PQCC might properly referred compiler generator
PQCC research code generation process sought build truly automatic system
The effort discovered designed phase structure PQC
The compiler provided initial structure
The phase included analysis front end intermediate translation virtual machine middle end translation target back end
TCOL developed PQCC research handle language specific construct intermediate representation

Early Windows design offered simple batch programming capability
The conventional transformation language used interpreter
While widely used Bash Batch compiler written
More recently sophisticated interpreted language became part developer tool kit
Modern scripting language include PHP Python Ruby Lua
Lua widely used game development
All interpreter compiler support
When field compiling began late focus limited translation language program machine code
The compiler field increasingly intertwined discipline including computer architecture programming language formal method software engineering computer security
The Compiler Research The Next Years article noted importance language Java
Security parallel computing cited among future research target
A compiler implement formal transformation source program target program
Compiler design define end end solution tackle defined subset interface compilation tool
preprocessors assembler linkers
Design requirement include rigorously defined interface internally compiler component externally supporting toolsets
In early day approach taken compiler design directly affected complexity computer language processed experience person designing resource available
Resource limitation led need pas source code
A compiler relatively simple language written one person might single monolithic piece software
However source language grows complexity design may split number interdependent phase
Separate phase provide design improvement focus development function compilation process
Classifying compiler number pass background hardware resource limitation computer
Compiling involves performing lot work early computer enough memory contain one program work
So compiler split smaller program made pas source representation performing required analysis translation
The ability compile classically seen benefit simplifies job writing compiler compiler generally perform compilation faster
Thus partly driven resource limitation early system many early language specifically designed could compiled single pas
In case design language feature may require compiler perform one pas source
For instance consider declaration appearing line source affect translation statement appearing line
In case first pas need gather information declaration appearing statement affect actual translation happening subsequent pas
The disadvantage compiling single pas possible perform many sophisticated needed generate high quality code
It difficult count exactly many pass optimizing compiler make
For instance different phase optimization may analyse one expression many time analyse another expression
Splitting compiler small program technique used researcher interested producing provably correct compiler
Proving correctness set small program often requires le effort proving correctness larger single equivalent program
Regardless exact number phase compiler design phase assigned one three stage
The stage include front end middle end back end
This approach make possible combine front end different language back end different sharing optimization middle end
Practical example approach multiple shared optimization multiple
The front end analyzes source code build internal representation program called IR
It also manages data structure mapping symbol source code associated information location type scope
While frontend single monolithic function program commonly implemented analyzed several phase may execute sequentially concurrently
This method favored due modularity
Most commonly today frontend broken three phase also known lexing also known scanning parsing
Lexing parsing comprise syntactic analysis word syntax phrase syntax respectively simple case module lexer parser automatically generated grammar language though complex case require manual modification
The lexical grammar phrase grammar usually simplifies analysis significantly handled semantic analysis phase
The semantic analysis phase generally complex written hand partially fully automated using
These phase broken lexing scanning evaluating parsing building CST parse tree transforming AST syntax tree
In case additional phase used notably rare
The main phase front end include following The middle end performs optimization intermediate representation order improve performance quality produced machine code
The middle end contains optimization independent CPU architecture targeted
The main phase middle end include following Compiler analysis prerequisite compiler optimization tightly work together
For example crucial
The scope compiler analysis optimization vary greatly small level even whole program
Obviously compiler potentially better job using broader view
But broad view free large scope analysis optimization costly term compilation time memory space especially true interprocedural analysis optimization
Interprocedural analysis optimization common modern commercial compiler
The open source criticized long time lacking powerful interprocedural optimization changing respect
Another open source compiler full analysis optimization infrastructure used many organization research commercial purpose
Due extra time space needed compiler analysis optimization compiler skip default
Users use compilation option explicitly tell compiler optimization enabled
The back end responsible CPU architecture specific optimization The main phase back end include following branch software engineering deal trying show compiler behaves according
Techniques include developing compiler using using rigorous testing often called compiler validation existing compiler
programming language usually appear type mind either designed
However practice rarely anything language exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted although possible design language rely run time
The categorization usually reflects popular widespread implementation language instance sometimes called interpreted language C compiled one despite existence BASIC compiler C interpreter
Interpretation replace compilation completely
It hide user make gradual
Even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack see
Further compiler contain interpreter optimization reason
For example expression executed compilation result inserted output program prevents recalculated time program run greatly speed final program
Modern trend toward time blur traditional categorization compiler interpreter even
Some language specification spell implementation include compilation facility example
However nothing inherent definition Common Lisp stop interpreted
Other language feature easy implement interpreter make writing compiler much harder example many scripting language allow program construct arbitrary source code runtime regular string operation execute code passing special
To implement feature compiled language program must usually shipped includes version compiler
One classification compiler generated code executes
This known A compiler one output intended directly run type computer operating system compiler run
The output designed run different platform
Cross compiler often used developing software intended support software development environment
The output compiler produce code VM may may executed platform compiler produced
For reason compiler usually classified native cross compiler
The lower level language target compiler may
C often viewed sort portable assembler also target language compiler

original compiler used C target language
The C created compiler usually intended read maintained human
So pretty C intermediate code irrelevant
Some feature C turn good target language

C code directive generated support original source
While common compiler type output machine code many type Compiler construction taught university school part curriculum
Such course usually supplemented implementation compiler
A example compiler Wirth used teach compiler construction
In spite simplicity compiler introduced several influential concept field including us programming language mature time lead need Standardization
The American National Standards Institute ANSI International Organization Standardization ISO manage standard various programming language FORTRAN COBOL C
Universities conjunction industry government provide active research development programming language associated language tool compiler integrated development environment formal validation suite
Professional organization representation across research education industry government

In creates form formal description
The input may text file containing written defines whose generated output parser programming language although definition exist
Usually resulting source code extended upon complete compiler emerges
A typical parser generator associate executable code rule grammar executed rule applied parser
These piece code sometimes referred semantic action routine since define semantics syntactic structure analyzed parser
Depending upon type parser generated routine may construct generate executable code directly
One earliest surprisingly powerful version accepted grammar rule able compile language
Some experimental take input formal description programming language semantics typically using
This approach often called compiling pioneered Semantic Implementation System SIS
However generated compiler code produced inefficient time space

Learn basic essay writing guide Extracts document Introduction Compilers Interpreters There two type translator converting language Pascal machine code compiler interpreter
These relieve programmer tedium complexity programming hence make programming considerably easier le error prone
Compiler This type translator take whole source code compiles object code
The object code sometimes called machine code run
Pascal example programming language us compilation
Interpreter This type translator take source code translates first line program executes
It second line third line get end code
BASIC LISP Prolog APL example programming language us interpretation
Compilers plus Interpreters
Some program written language JAVA compiled interpreted
A program firstly compiled code
It distributed user use wide range computer Mac PCs
These computer run convert compiled code code use
Languages JAVA said program written language run machine
These type language ideal use Internet know anything machine running code
Compilation interpretation compared Compilation much faster interpretation
Once compilation process completed object code run much faster interpreted code
Middle The lexical analyser add Item Name Run Time Value
The common way organising symbol table use hash table
The identifier hashed memory location
Semantic Analysis It concerned meaning interpretation word context used
For example A B may correct PASCAL statement possible assign B A A integer variable B character variable
Semantic analysis check statement correct meaning
Examples Are parameter argument type subprogram compatible
b Do number parameter argument match
c In assignment statement type LHS RHS compatible
In natual language example English sentence may also syntactically correct sematically meaningless
For example man eats apple meaning obeys rule language whereas apple eats man obeys rule language syntax semantics
Syntactic correctness imply semantic correctness
Code Generation Source code first passed lexical analysis program syntax analysis program
It given code generation program actually produce object code
A high level language first LEXICALLY analysed
Then SYNTAX analysed
During syntax analysis SEMANTICS code checked see make sense
If error found stage REPORT GENERATOR program spring action display helpful helpful Conclusion A library file contains collection object file
The linkage editor manage file link program necessary
In order link object file file copied memory
It also necessary copy executable file memory executed
When program code copied memory said code loaded memory
The program performs task called loader
The loader usually integral part linkage editor
Loader A program loaded memory library program known loader
There two type loader Absolute loader It load program single fixed area memory
All address reference program fixed translation time program assembled compiled work properly loaded one specific position main memory
b Relocating loader It load program anywhere main memory program translated way address relative start program
The start address program held special register called base register
There two basic form relocatable object program prepared
For first form static relocation object program loaded main memory relocatability lost process moved
For second form dynamic relocation relocatability retained process may moved different memory execution essential program constantly swapped memory

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I reading Dragon Book
The following start Section
When one lexeme match pattern lexical analyzer must provide subsequent compiler phase additional information particular lexeme matched
For example pattern token match extremely important code generator know lexeme found source program
Thus many case lexical analyzer return parser token name attribute value describes lexeme represented token token name influence parsing decision attribute value influence translation token parse
From I understand symbol table store variable name detail like type scope etc
So character found lexical analyzer match pattern number us token name token becomes
As per snippet I cited I understand data stored symbol table number
Is value number stored symbol table
Typical lexers return sequence pair pair consists token type optional value
For token token type something like number value
If lexer emitted information numeric constant input following phase parser would way know number obviously important
I understand started talking symbol table end question I think may confused
The quotation gave say nothing symbol table usually belongs later phase compilation
A symbol table map symbol name value
The quotation question token symbol
Tokens usually stored symbol table reason store number symbol table
Typically parser stack push whole token onto stack pop needed
What compiler store symbol table whatever need job code generation
The value number certainly must
Other data might include stuff like small number might shorter representation included inline instruction
No symbol table could keep identifier number

first integer met possible id could
The number number stored either memory Abstract Syntax Tree AST
If number appear initialization
int array C initialize array allocated memory
If appear expression leaf AST

What JIT compiler specifically opposed compiler
Can someone give succinct easy understand description
A JIT compiler run program started compiles code usually bytecode kind VM instruction fly called form usually faster typically host CPU native instruction set
A JIT access dynamic runtime information whereas standard compiler make better optimization like inlining function used frequently
This contrast traditional compiler compiles code machine language program first run
To paraphrase conventional compiler build whole program EXE file BEFORE first time run
For newer style program assembly generated pseudocode
Only AFTER execute program OS icon JIT compiler kick generate machine code processor whatever understand
In beginning compiler responsible turning language defined higher level assembler object code machine instruction would linked linker executable
At one point evolution language compiler would compile language would interpreted interpreter run program
This eliminated object code executables allowed language portable multiple operating system hardware platform
Pascal compiled one first Java C recent example
Eventually term replaced bytecode since byte long
A JIT compiler feature interpreter instead interpreting bytecode every time method invoked compile bytecode machine code instruction running machine invoke object code instead
Ideally efficiency running object code overcome inefficiency recompiling program every time run
time word say needed demand The source code completely converted machine code The source code converted assembly language like structure ex IL intermediate language C ByteCode java
The intermediate code converted machine language application need required code converted machine code
In JIT code converted machine code first part code necessary converted machine code method functionality called machine turned machine code reduces burden CPU
As machine code generated run time JIT compiler produce machine code optimised running machine CPU architecture
As mentioned Just add point discussion JVM maintains count many time function executed
If count exceeds predefined limit JIT compiles code machine language directly executed processor unlike normal case javac compile code bytecode java interpreter interprets bytecode line line convert machine code executes
Also next time function calculated compiled code executed unlike normal interpretation code interpreted line line
This make execution faster
JIT stand mean code get compiled needed runtime
This beneficial compiler generate code optimised particular machine
A static compiler like average C compiler compile code executable code developer machine
Hence compiler perform optimisation based assumption
It compile slowly optimisation slowing execution program user
After byte code architecture neutral generated Java compiler execution handled JVM Java
The byte code loaded JVM loader byte instruction interpreted
When need call method multiple time need interpret code many time may take time needed
So JIT compiler
When byte loaded JVM run time whole code compiled rather interpreted thus saving time
JIT compiler work run time binary output
It compiles java bytecodes machine instruction specific CPU
For example loop statement java code The loop code run time value
It necessary compile bytecode time instruction going execute time
In case necessary compile code value changed required number time
So Just In Time JIT Compiler keep track statement method said compiles piece byte code machine code better performance
Another similar example search pattern using Regular Expression list
JIT Compiler compile code machine code
It compiles code similar pattern run time
See read
I know old thread runtime optimization another important part JIT compilation seemed discussed
Basically JIT compiler monitor program run determine way improve execution
Then make change fly runtime
Google JIT optimization javaworld pretty You code compliled IL intermediate language
When run program computer understand code
It understands native code
So JIT compiler compiles IL native code fly
It method level
Jit stand time compiler jit program turn java byte code instruction sent directly processor
Using java time compiler really second compiler particular system platform complies bytecode particular system code code jit complier usually run quickly computer
The compiler come virtual machine used optionally
It compiles bytecode executable code immediately executed
A compiler take source code transforms machine specific byte code compile time
A JIT compiler take machine agnostic byte code generated compile time transforms machine specific byte code run time
The JIT compiler Java us allows single binary run multitude platform without modification
The following code example show JIT optimizes Java code
Code Before Optimization Code After Optimization Originally code contained two call method
After optimization two method call optimized single operation optimized code need perform method call acquire field value class B
byte code used time
The JIT compiler get stats optimizes byte code run faster adding inline method removal unused lock etc also creating bytecode specific machine
I quoting article I found handy
JIT refers execution engine JVM implementation one faster requires memory compiler
In scheme bytecodes method compiled native machine code first time method invoked
The native machine code method cached next time method invoked
JVM actually performs compilation step runtime performance reason
This mean Java clean separation
It first called static compilation Java source code bytecode
Then bytecode passed JVM execution
But executing bytecode slow JVM measure often bytecode run detects hotspot code run frequently performs dynamic compilation bytecode machinecode hotspot code hotspot profiler
So effectively today Java program run machinecode execution

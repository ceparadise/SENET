Lesser math confidence stronger preference artistic field dissuade woman majoring computer science smaller degree today past analysis student interest computer science show
Efforts shrink gender gap computer science would benefit better understanding pursues computer science
That basis paper Anatomy Enduring Gender Gap The Evolution Women Participation Computer Science analyzed student interest computer science period
The paper presented Monday American Educational Research Association annual meeting
The author found wide fluctuation student interest computer science steady underrepresentation woman
To help combat paper recommends focusing way computer science lead career creative positive effect community woman artistic social activist leaning perceived computer science complementary interest
One paper key finding shrinking salience math confidence predictor majoring computer science
The finding based response student institution Cooperative Institutional Research Program Freshman Survey run Higher Education Research Institute University California Los Angeles
The survey asks student intended major information paper whether student actually went complete degree computer science
The data also include community college author write important steppingstone science technology engineering mathematics field woman
Interest computer science spiked men woman early falling decade later
When interest bounced back late mainly among men
In percent male student surveyed computer science major compared percent female student
The share computer science major woman also near constant decline since early woman representing percent computer science major
Unfortunately mean woman involvement computer science dropped demand experience career opportunity field grown author write
Math confidence still predominant explanation gender gap dropped accounting nearly percent gap percent
That positive trend since woman always rated math skill low relative men even among men woman score top percent math portion SAT said Linda Sax professor Graduate School Education Information Studies UCLA lead author paper
Another positive finding woman see creative artistic le likely deterred computer science past
On hand interest social activism negative predictor gender interest computer science
That important gender gap woman general tend place higher priority pursuing field help others Sax said
She also said discouraging family aspiration among gender increasingly tied decreased interest computer science
The author write administrator policy maker focus effort helping woman understand range creative opportunity stem computer science degree rather trying recruit woman share trait men traditionally pursued field
Sax also suggested faculty member involved recruiting student writing curriculum emphasize social factor related computer science course title syllabus
The field brand way make student aware possibility said adding several department across country already started
One example gave launched Harvey Mudd College Anita Borg Institute increase diversity computer science university
This research part drive Sax get researcher public stop talking STEM field aggregate especially term gender gap
While gap especially pronounced computer science engineering woman actually outnumber men biological science said
Every field different said
Every field attracts different constellation student changed different In addition Sax paper produced Kathleen Lehman Allison Kanny Gloria Lim Laura Paulson Hilary Zimmerman UCLA Jerry Jacobs University Pennsylvania

There clear disconnect computer science industry message girl receive ability succeed tech organization
This guide examines history behind disparity educator parent employer computer scientist reverse trend
Before advent home computer early substantially woman undertook computer science degree
According academic year woman accounted nearly computer science undergraduate student
This number steadily dropped widespread use home computer became common
A everyday usage personal computer within home found men far likely use computer use hour per week woman
Only men reported using computer weekly basis compared female surveyed
As woman made computer science student
Much attention devoted studying reason drop female computer science major
The central conclusion first personal computer essentially early gaming system firmly catered male
While early word processing tool also available told story new device met need men
As male began purchasing computer personal use nerdy programmer classification began take hold professional world computer science
By percentage woman studying computer science postsecondary level
Though woman represent workforce compared engineer female
Furthermore percentage woman working computer profession steadily declined since dropping last year
According number possible step towards reversing trend encouraging female student undertake computer science
By fostering interest scientific topic early age working remove negative connotation barrier educator parent work together help girl maintain confidence curiosity STEM subject
For professional already field woman offer role model mentor men take stand sexist prejudiced behavior workplace
Due marketing strategy last three decade many woman developed misconception computer science
While notion geek coder alive well many young woman may unaware myriad job available opportunity make palpable difference
The University California Berkeley experienced revolution introductory computer science class changing marketed course
What used known Introduction Symbolic Programming called The Beauty Joy Computing
The
For first time woman class outnumbered men
A recent Deloitte found woman choice account buying decision nationwide
In addition impactful career offered computer science one field woman opportunity earn salary male counterpart
According discrepancy overall pay rate remained stalled last decade
Even woman make cent dollar compared men position however incongruity far le pronounced perhaps even within field computer science
As Smithsonian Magazine survey conducted AAUW recent graduate found one year graduation male female programmer earning salary
The absence gender shift within pay scale also held true traditionally industry including math physical science occupation
A recent Deloitte found woman choice account buying decision nationwide
Furthermore diversity opinion integral innovation
Though still commonplace find board project team without sole female member integration woman field naturally lead holistic understanding consumer marketplace
In addition reason mentioned many tech computer science company forefront progressive workplace policy
Some innovative tech company benefit include In report researcher found woman working tech company particularly much likely healthy balance
Many tech company supportive professional procedure working home employing videoconferencing technology
Furthermore many company also flexible hour allowing employee work best suit provided project completed time
While average length maternity leave America salaried employee six week many technology company recognize key component keeping female employee providing substantial fair policy new mother
Some parental leave policy include Whether new father mother adoptive parent Facebook employee receive four month paid leave addition baby cash assist unexpected cost
Furthermore company set breastfeeding room office
Expectant mother given total week work including four week delivery
Fathers adoptive parent provided six week paid leave
Additionally Apple Facebook offer assistance adoption fertility treatment including freezing egg
This massive tech company offer variety provision
All biological mother receive week paid leave number extending complication arise
All new parent receive week paid leave primary caregiver eligible seven week
Aside generous time company also offer assistance program help new parent find childcare discount agency place nanny towards supply new child special room mother breastfeed

In addition generous paid leave program company offer variety benefit child growing
A subsidized onsite child care center mean parent visit kid throughout day company cafeteria includes special menu appealing younger crowd think hot dog
The company also instills spirit trust employee allowing step away office whenever necessary long work completed time
Now historical reasoning misconception overturned time think taking step toward involving woman industry
Keep reading learn fostering passion computer science young girl
With number female studying computer science near low clear action need taken
Understanding root problem start early age essential rectifying
According recent coverage child indicate interest science however enter middle school percentage interested girl fall dramatically
By high school many girl previously took advanced scientific course drop study
child indicate interest science however enter middle school percentage interested girl fall dramatically
The summary offered corroborated extended conducted researcher Florida Gulf Coast University The University Colorado cite numerous reason drop female interest education progress
In secondary school le emphasis placed developing girl computer science skill compared boy
Even go study topic college often report feeling lag behind male counterpart due dearth attention high school level
Furthermore female student lack relatable role model inspiration given many leader field men
Lastly historic marketing perception scientific field catered largely male student
While characterization permeated last decade still belief profession often narrow impersonal unsuited wish make difference human level
Beginning number woman studying computer science similar field fell steep decline
In recent year number leveled establishing baseline assessing success newly implemented educational initiative
Some innovative way educator parent work increase girl interest computer science subject include While boy tend verbal class educator engage female student bring learning initiative discussion
This increase likelihood girl engaging subject matter better prepare plan study one topic collegiate level
Girls entering field computer science likely face resistance subject area heavily populated female
Adults bolster resolve providing example strong successful female thriving career
Whether creating mentorship program secondary postsecondary level bringing speaker using female leader case study educator parent instill sense confidence girl interested pursuing historically male dominated field giving role model
As discussed previous section number woman computer science related degree dropped sharply response message home computer mostly men
In interim year woman shifted subject typically referred humanity liberal art evidenced A June report featured Harvey Mudd College effort counter trend
Rather pure programming introductory computer science course reworked focus solving wealth opportunity within field
The school also lessened intimidation factor splitting course two section based incoming student prior programming experience
The result
Within four year college went woman electing major subject
As push encourage girl interest computer science gain momentum number program created help foster interest
Some innovative include Whether operating middle school high school collegiate level group pivotal encouraging sustaining girl pursuit topic
Outside organization mentioned number initiative engage girl computer science
Whether competition summer camp science fair MOOC governmental program resource help parent educator think outside box come encouraging girl scientific pursuit
This organization host computer science technology competition middle school girl develop project solve social problem

By In classroom Georgia Tech among laptop notebook line code senior computer science major Marguerite Murrell like play game dubbed Count Girls
If I keep two hand I win Murrell said
There certainly girl probably computer science program nation
But lot guy
Women earn computer science bachelor degree United States
And leader Apple CEO Tim Cook US tech industry solve gender imbalance issue America lose lead tech
But recent year number top college made effort draw woman field revamped introductory course make technology le intimidating enter college without prior programming effort
Many school boast gender parity basic course incoming freshman class
But student men continue dominate technical course robotics machine learning security Count Girls still yield poor result class
A confluence factor prevent woman pursuing persisting computer science major according Wendy DuBow director evaluation senior research scientist National Center Women Information Technology
A lack exposure computer science engineering concept middle school high school teacher parent steering girl away class general lack awareness potential career tech field contribute
Recent sexual harassment case tech firm Uber also make field appear attractive place woman build career DuBow said matter lucrative
Carnegie Mellon University Massachusetts Institute Technology MIT Harvard University Stanford University University Georgia Institute Technology made concerted effort attract female student computer science program
Academic institution commit parity really start see result use practice like scaffolding intro course making sure faculty use inclusive pedagogy classroom DuBow said
However challenge isolation stereotyping confidence still remain
What follows look beyond glossy college catalogue female computer science major actually experience campus changing introductory course enough build pipeline woman needed fill tech job
Many college recognize way computer science program structured discouraged woman entering said Elizabeth Ames senior vice president marketing alliance program Anita Borg Institute
For example course often assumed student background programming already
And woman tech little community campus
The success story changing approach found Harvey Mudd College Claremont CA percentage female computer science major grew le largely thanks president Maria Klawe
Carnegie Mellon University seen similar result Women made incoming freshman computer science major far cry even
Many change spurred Lenore Blum professor computer science joined faculty
Her guiding philosophy
The minority community access critical academic professional opportunity advantage majority critical success Blum said
For example male computer science major easy access role model look like professor people workforce likely roommate people living dorm also studying computer science help homework
If woman one small number connection teacher look like Blum said
You nobody ask naturally night work homework
It would probably pretty awkward call guy say I problem homework midnight
Want come
Not easy
Blum launched program supported faculty funded school meant connect female student major mentor advisor woman working tech activity could leader
We helped change culture explicitly offering important professional advantage Blum said
We change curriculum
We changed culture
It rocket science common sense
At time dean Raj Reddy changed admission policy accept student strong math science experience also broader interest
This opened door admission office look closely talented woman could really program even programming since three year old Blum said
At collaborative space campus Carnegie Mellon student meet brainstorm
Despite positive change gender parity seen freshman class yet come senior level Blum said
And male tend transfer major often female leading disparity course
In computer science bachelor degree awarded woman Carnegie Mellon
Rachel Holladay graduated degree computer science robotics Carnegie Mellon said incoming class female
I rarely one computer science class Holladay said
But computer science class robotics class fewer woman
While felt accepted peer professor You experience individual situation feel though slightly disrespected someone listening Holladay said
I tell experience another woman technical field immediately understand I talking
It subtle hard really see line
Larger issue including culture report sexual harassment many tech giant likely continue keep young woman field Holladay said
A friend told tech startup free beer tampon pad bathroom cost Holladay said
Those little thing hit every single day everywhere go need fix smaller society thing make people comfortable work environment nobody want fight small battle every day
You get tired
Research show male female student enter computer science course level male think skilled female think le skilled said Barb Ericson director computing outreach College Computing Georgia Tech
A study Harvard found woman eight year programming experience report level confidence men zero one year programming experience
A lot woman tend leave major even though better grade guy stay confident ability Ericson said
The confidence factor also impact take computer science introductory course opts
At Harvard intro course designed major woman school year
It taken persona college said Priscilla Guo senior technology policy society concentrator Harvard
It sensationalized one course
Every single lecture almost like one showcase tech conference lot interaction engagement audience
It like show
The course goal make programming relatable student offered lot support including several teaching assistant office hour
However get second intro course number woman drop Guo said
And Harvard computer science bachelor degree awarded woman
The problem
So many men woman come college programming experience skip said Michelle Danoff graduated Harvard degree computer science work associate product manager Google
If look student progress department decrease woman course large part many men going directly
Further woman past programming experience often still choose take men comparable experience choose skip playing confidence dynamic Danoff said
Male student even sometimes sign teaching assistant course never took feel confident enough take role Guo said
Female student hand likely justify signing saying I never taken class I expertise TA Guo added
At Georgia Tech every student required take one three computer science intro course One engineering major one computer science major one student
In past computer science taught interesting way Ericson said
And getting professor change habit much time proved difficult added
A computer science student Georgia Tech work coding project
Further lot instructor believe born often think woman Ericson said
Women face uphill climb professor friend family like
Why
Intro course interesting creative social offer plenty help especially woman tend come le experience le confidence Ericson said
Murrell teaching assistant one Georgia Tech introductory course
I see lot girl get really excited coding end happening lot girl say know I want switch I know hard
Maybe I get minor said
So really easy see girl get interested harder actually convince switch entire track
Maria Ximena graduated MIT bachelor computer science pursuing master field school
She switch course study math computer science taking intro course freshman year realizing passion coding
That course also split men woman said
But became interested computer system networking course number woman dropped significantly
Stanford intro course also close gender parity said Mehran Sahami professor associate chair education computer science department
I think awareness potential impact someone computer science seen discipline go become programmer way able harness power technology solve problem across many different field Sahami said
However percentage woman computer science class drop
Women often take intro course later even late senior year Sahami said
In Stanford computer science graduate woman
At University revamped introductory computer science course split men woman since
If really great experience kind serve pied piper sort entice folk really great field people unfortunately misperception high school said Dan Garcia professor department electrical engineering computer science Berkeley College Engineering
The course name Introduction Symbolic Programming recast Beauty Joy Computing
In Garcia allows student choose project work pair
There also component social implication computing lab time
But change yet make impact degree level In Berkeley computer science graduate woman
Saloni Shah senior computer science major Berkeley said noticed woman class increased difficulty
You start realize many people like lot stereotype feel really place Shah said
For example one discussion section Shah one two woman student
And information session machine learning club Shah said female attendee people
I think topic draw woman away Shah said
But know men guarantee men one support
One particular aspect computer science see equitable number men woman classroom across university examined story User interface UI user experience UX course
These subject tend focused design element computer
What draw female area
Even little given crayon marker draw whereas guy given LEGO block build thing said Lindsay Knapp junior computational medium major Georgia Tech
Knapp said course include far woman subject artificial intelligence security
There also perception part field easier especially people coding since child Murrell said
The majority female student interviewed story said generally feel respected treated equally male professor peer
But everyone experienced exception
Shah participated collegiate hackathons usually woman attendance
Sometimes get accepted one guy friend like well obviously got girl need girl present
We make actually try
That kind silly like accepted end day still like guy said
An engineering student Georgia Tech work hardware project
I project
I definitely shown I Shah added
I think actually believe woman belong computer science
But happens often mean justifying get something
Shah also interned Google past two summer said talk much
When past male peer made comment like got needed diversity
I rather get I mention said
Murrell said instance felt defeated woman field
I job teaching assistant really great network female friend class said
If I thing would probably little tougher little lonelier
Still Murrell first technical interview internship said found male interviewer bit standoffish gave easy coding question
I learned stuff two year ago Murrell said
Part like wonder I looked like like quintessential coder would expected
MIT said found computer science community school far welcoming native country Colombia
I found extremely supportive community try really hard treat woman men said
But nothing perfect
After helping create group MIT said heard upsetting story classmate
Some woman group said heard sexist comment lab partner thing like wrong today period
said
Or professor le expectation woman made comment like need get married soon
A lack representation among computer science professor may also keep woman continuing major computer science faculty member North America woman
This another pipeline issue according Blum Carnegie Mellon
Many woman student going graduate school said offered job top tech firm right college
If woman go graduate school get PhDs going role model faculty level concern
After survey MIT computer science engineering student found woman tend doubt ability men feel negative bias recommended school provide role model multiple level including teaching assistant faculty
But easier said done
The best thing continue best attract retain promote woman field said Ian Waitz dean school engineering MIT
It hard
When hire faculty computer science may applicant woman
We still way go
It start undergrad coming fact undergrad getting diverse move forward timeline long
The pipeline get smaller smaller undergraduate level said Garcia Berkeley
The percentage woman graduate student population much lower undergraduate population Garcia said
At Berkeley spring computer science master PhD student woman
The higher go totem poll lower percentage female faculty
This also true minority Garcia said
A lack female representation among faculty teaching assistant impact student
Holladay Carnegie Mellon graduate pursuing PhD field MIT aim becoming research professor
I one computer science class female professor
And computer science taught male professor Holladay said
It bothered honest
I think female faculty would also encourage retention pipeline
At Harvard majority Danoff professor also male said
There nothing powerful term feeling like something seeing someone like Danoff said
I think incredibly important female faculty
Despite gender disparity persist modern computer science classroom fact remains top college graduating woman level national average taking positive step right many smaller school may lack resource
Our challenge sometimes le engineering school whole true lot competitive university Waitz MIT said
We opportunity pick exceptionally large applicant pool small number student
What want class made individually excellent people collectively excellent need broadly diverse class different gender background country
We opportunity large number applicant
Students Carnegie Mellon glued laptop prepare latest assignment
But school alter introductory course create woman group mentorship program persistent searching promoting female faculty member
Even college without lot resource faculty chair dean commit wanting diverse student body take kind step DuBow said
Colleges also recruiting effort among undecided student STEM major typically limited number seat available nursing
The professional technology world also long way go better attract retain woman Ames said starting advancing woman already working
Research show company woman senior executive technical role better attract woman technical role added
Tech leader stop saying pipeline problem essentially cop Ames said
They need focus organization improve ecosystem overall
The microculture organization college greatly impact woman participation computer science Blum said
It whole world change added
We change culture right

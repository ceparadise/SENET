Scope
Sure
There two way go
Most present day CSE student go way
This involve job company like TCS Wipro Infosys Whatever ave studied year would use case require undergo training process join company
Although work redundant paid reasonable amount money lead luxurious life
I would recommend way get bored mundane work leave eventually
Now coming interesting way
It difficult precisely define way life full challenge achievement way
I still studying I think way give immense job satisfaction
You think
You learn
You apply
However I talking thing learn classroom
Most thing learn use
They lay foundation stone
Whatever extra work gon na stay
With said exciting field Computer Science pursue
How Google AI defeated Flee Sedol game
And many many many field work
Each WoW factor
So answer question Yes friend
Computer Science wide scope
Firstly never think present try learn something
You think Computer science engineering great give chance people electronics background computer science background learn develop application never existed
The computer theory till electronics engineer came along build one
The branch tremendous potential aggressive research
It provides good platform hardware geek try develop new hardware new software seamlessly work hardware
I think future smart processor smarter arduinos rasberry pi
So scope Computer engineering great today tomorrow world Still question

The machine simple complex minute enormous
Some like sewing machine specific application like electric drill used variety purpose
Some machine designed specific purpose component many different machine
Another fundamental aspect twentieth century life vast amount variety information surrounding man
The computer perhaps useful tool yet development
It first commercial available computer market
Today using computer ever increasing number way never imagined year ago
Computers integral part information need many society
They used wide solve variety information financial health tax credit insurance forth
The modern society virtually embraced use computer fact commerce industry
A computer automatic device performs calculation solve problem also capable storing information
It four basic part input unit storage unit central processing unit output unit
Though series application lead accomplishment specific task
Computer capable manipulating large value data accurately incredibly speed
Tasks would require human effort several day performed computer within split second thus use computer become quite valuable commerce industry
Computer used organization process data provide accurate timely information use management
This go long way facilitating realization set goal objective resource manager hence level performance since access accurate timely information
The mentioned fact motivate THE NEED FOR THE DESIGN AND COMPUTERIZATION STUDENTS RESULTS AND GRADING FOR A FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC NEKEDE As part effort towards ensuring adequate regular record student result grading federal polytechnic nekede
Students result grading activity implies indebt examination evaluation set financial statement underlying result grading document form objective opinion expressed form audit report truth fairness view expressed financial statement personnel federal polytechnic nekede
Before advent computer system auditing done manually
But due expansion increase organization person business become highly difficult cumbersome accelerate auditing progressively
Roles document containing information personnel auditing increase day thereby making hard keep information personnel accurately
Auditors suffer tremendously result
This project will undoubtedly development existing system
System
Students result grading involves use ledger proof sheet balance book etc One biggest difficulty faced manual student result grading problem error traceable human mistake shortcoming Handling result grading beset problem
The record kept well retrieval difficult b Loss result grading always common manual auditing computerized way storing information contained result grading c Calculation sometime wrong
In case oft many account name resulted suspense account opened could closed unless charge credit profit le account
This research prompted problem basis problem facing manual student result grading promoted research auditing system prompted researcher look subject curbing controlling student result grading manually
The purpose research study analysis existing student result grading computer science department federal polytechnic nekede Ascertain whether existing system adequate
ii Highlight inadequacy existing system computer application ca minimize computer used effectively organization eliminate inefficiency

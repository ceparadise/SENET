If high school student parent one thinking study college computer science obviously solid choice
continues go little sign either trend changing anytime soon
But college CS degree give get biggest bang tuition buck
Based new data PayScale apply state university
PayScale recently
They gathered data cost hundred college university earnings alumnus
Using data school PayScale calculated net ROI total amount graduate expect earn next year would otherwise earn without college degree minus cost education
PayScale also calculates annual ROI next year compare return college investment would stock way invest money
The PayScale data also break thing major
published got ahold raw data dig little
They found looking ROI net cost college cost taking account financial aid top highest ROI major computer science Stanford computer science grad leading way million net ROI year
The degree crack top economics degree Stanford million
The rest top included school probably expect MIT Harvard Carnegie Mellon
So already knew computer science major really pay particularly go big name private school
However since everybody get Stanford Harvard MIT afford even financial aid I wanted look different way
I used query tool PayScale site look school computer science graduate got best return investment based annual ROI
Here We see annual ROI CS degree public university student dominate annual return private school
top computer science program ranked annual ROI state school student University Virginia topping list annual ROI two private school Harvard Stanford make top
In fact look state school program Columbia University Park University MIT join Harvard Stanford private school top
The message
If thinking college financial investment studying computer science one state public university way go
Of course purely based raw financial number take account important thing affect one college experience like location choice extracurricular activity quality dining hall food
You child math
Based expected annual return computer science degree state university pay IDG Communications Inc

By continuing use site agreeing new
Harvey Mudd College private college Claremont offer student biggest bang buck according report website track pay data
During first year getting degree graduate expect come million ahead peer skipped college went straight work high school
But return investment depends lot student major
For computer science major Stanford University offer best deal return million first year career
Education major hand may make much computer scientist graduation get money Montclair State University New Jersey
Education alum expect return investment first year earning degree
We need people teacher social worker said Katie Bardaro economist PayScale
But want go field need understand income potential make right choice taking loan go school
Majors liberal art program also enjoy much better income potential pick right school
Political science major Texas A M University example earn return almost average
At Columbia University art graduate expect earn return investment
In general student get best bang buck major science technology engineering math STEM attend school program help job placement
When come earnings yes STEM said Bardaro
PayScale study looked much college grad earned first year career minus cost tuition room board book taking financial aid account
PayScale compared number pay high school grad worked year

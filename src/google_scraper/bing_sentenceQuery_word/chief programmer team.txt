A people develop maintain
They may organised numerous way team two common structure typically used
The egoless programming team contain group ten fewer programmer
Code exchanged goal set amongst group member
Leadership rotated within group according need ability required specific time
The lack structure egoless team result weakness efficiency effectiveness error detection project
Egoless programming team work best task complex
Individuals part decentralized programming team report higher job satisfaction
The chief programmer team usually contain team
Consisting chief programmer senior level programmer program librarian additional programmer analyst added team necessary
The weakness structure include lack communication across team member task cooperation complex task completion
The chief programmer team work best task simple straightforward since flow information team limited
Individuals work team structure typically report lower work morale
The main determinant choosing programming team structure typically include difficulty size duration modularity reliability time sociability

Many unaware phenomenon Agile Software Development paradigm began Chief Programmer Teams maturing evolving complete methodology late
Today paradigm often reduced lowest common denominator
This reduces Agile Methodology process quick dirty hacking little quality assurance factored
Version Control Controlled fully tested build Delivery Services implementation paradigm loosely controlled controlled
In essence Configuration Management Principles ignored thinly threaded result unpredictable poor performing maintenance nightmare
The refined formalized Agile Methodology defined software development incorporating group based requirement solution evolve collaboration
It promotes adaptive planning evolutionary development delivery encourages rapid flexible response change
It conceptual framework promotes foreseen interaction throughout development cycle
The introduced term Agile Methodology root fine pedigree development methodology began formulated growing formal methodology
This methodology augmented Capability Maturity Model
The registered CMU development model created study data collected organization contracted funded research
This model became foundation CMU created SEI
The term maturity relates degree formality optimization process practice formally defined step managed result metric active optimization In use computer grew widespread flexible le costly
Organizations began adopt computerized information system demand grew significantly
Many process software development infancy standard best practice approach defined
As result growth accompanied growing pain project failure common field still early year ambition project scale complexity exceeded market capability deliver adequate product within planned budget
Individuals began publish article book research result attempt professionalize process
Tom DeMarco authored Christopher Chris Gane Trish Sarson wrote published
Both publication major contribution known SSADM
Harlan Mills author Chief Programmer Teams Principles Procedures IBM Federal Systems Division Report Gaithersburg Md
I believe published around
As IBM research fellow Professor Mills adapted existing idea engineering computer science software development
These included structured programming theory Edsger Dijkstra Robert Floyd awarded Turing Award well others
His Cleanroom software development process emphasized design formal specification
Frederick Phillips Brooks software engineer computer scientist best known managing development IBM family computer software support package later writing candidly process landmark book The Mythical
He wrote paper No Silver Bullet Essence Accidents Software Engineering

Brooks received many award including National Medal Technology Turing Award spent several year studying work IBM Fellow Harlan Mills Edsger Dijkstra Robert W Bob Floyd
Data flow diagram proposed Larry Constantine original developer structured design based Martin Estrin data flow graph model computation
He started working career Technical Laboratory Nuclear Science
From Staff Consultant C E I R From President Information Systems Institute Inc
In also became program instructor Wharton School Business University Pennsylvania
From faculty member Systems Research Institute
Larry Constantine left SRI began development manuscript Fundamentals Program Design A Structured Approach
In resumed work manuscript American Edward Nash Yourdon software engineer computer consultant author lecturer pioneer software engineering methodology reviewed Constantine manuscript urging complete
With combined effort Larry Constantine Edward Yourdon work manuscript continued
As part structured design Larry Constantine developed concept cohesion degree internal content module related coupling degree module depends upon module
These two concept influential development software engineering stand alone Design significant contribution right
They proved foundation area ranging software design software metric become part vernacular discipline
Larry Constantine Edward Yourdon known clear influence methodology creation efficient reliable software publication definitive work Edward Constantine copyright published Yourdon Press
The publication considered valuable even sell brand new copy yes still print USD
If shop around may still find new copy USD
Used copy good good condition may range USD shipping cost USD shipped continental United States
In Constantine received Product Excellence best book publication entitled
In received Platinum Award Excellence Design Competition Siemens AG Lite
In recognized Distinguished Engineer made Fellow ACM
He recipient He also received
Professor Constantine professional Member member Active Member
Professor Constantine currently faculty Mathematics Engineering Department considered one pioneer computing
He professor since headed Laboratory Software Engineering research center dedicated study human aspect modern software engineering
In become Institute Fellow participating joint program CMU University Madeira
Recently collaboration Lucy Lockwood Professor Constantine established consulting firm

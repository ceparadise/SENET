In domain CPU problem CPU next instruction execute following clock cycle potentially lead incorrect computation result
Three common type hazard data hazard structural hazard control flow hazard branching hazard
There several method used deal hazard including bubbling case method
pipelined processor performed several stage given time several instruction processed various stage pipeline fetch execute
There many different instruction pipeline instruction may
A hazard occurs two simultaneous possibly order instruction conflict
Data hazard occur instruction exhibit modify data different stage pipeline
Ignoring potential data hazard result also termed race hazard
There three situation data hazard occur Consider two instruction occurring program order
try read source writes A read write RAW data hazard refers situation instruction refers result yet calculated retrieved
This occur even though instruction executed prior instruction prior instruction processed partly pipeline
For example The first instruction calculating value saved register second going use value compute result register
However operand fetched operation result first yet saved hence data dependency occurs
A data dependency occurs instruction dependent completion instruction
try write destination read A write read WAR data hazard represents problem concurrent execution
For example In situation chance may finish concurrent execution must ensured result register stored chance fetch operand
try write operand written A write write WAW data hazard may occur environment
For example The write back WB must delayed finish executing
A structural hazard occurs part processor hardware needed two instruction time
A canonical example single memory unit accessed fetch stage instruction retrieved memory memory stage data written read memory
They often resolved separating component unit separate cache
Branching hazard also termed control hazard occur
On many instruction pipeline microarchitectures processor know outcome branch need insert new instruction pipeline normally stage
also termed method preclude data structural branch hazard
As instruction fetched control logic determines whether hazard occur
If true control logic insert pipeline
Thus next instruction would cause hazard executes prior one sufficient time finish prevent hazard
If number equal number stage pipeline processor cleared instruction proceed free hazard
All form stalling introduce delay processor resume execution
occurs branch instruction jump new memory location invalidating prior stage pipeline
These prior stage cleared allowing pipeline continue new instruction indicated branch
There several main solution algorithm used resolve data hazard In case algorithm used The task removing data dependency delegated compiler fill appropriate number instruction dependent instruction ensure correct operation instruction possible
For example write value register already contains add register store result register
Following execution register contain value
However Instruction write register fully exit pipeline Instruction start executing mean Register contain value Instruction performs addition
In event Instruction add old value register register contains instead
This error occurs Instruction read Register Instruction result write operation Register
So Instruction reading content Register register still contains
Forwarding described help correct error depending fact output Instruction used subsequent instruction value committed Register
Forwarding applied example mean The effect Instruction us correct recent value Register made immediately pipelined
With forwarding enabled stage pipeline two input value read register specified example value Register new value Register example value sent next stage
Added control logic used determine input use
To avoid control hazard microarchitectures In event branch cause pipeline bubble incorrect instruction entered pipeline care must taken prevent instruction effect processor state excluding energy wasted processing discovered loaded incorrectly
Memory latency another factor designer must attend delay could reduce performance
Different type memory different accessing time memory
Thus choosing suitable type memory designer improve performance pipelined data path

We know running research lab challenge say least
In hustle loading autosampler pipetting pouring mixing research experiment worker health safety overlooked inadvertently pushed aside dire consequence
Understanding required OSHA program recognizing hazard help identify minimize many common safety health hazard associated running research laboratory
This Safety Guys column assist navigation health safety maze
We present overview common hazard encountered typical research lab
Our hope one topic might strike nerve motivate dig deeper ensure safe work environment
OSHA tell employer must provide workplace free recognized There many specific OSHA standard may apply research laboratory
Most notable Occupational Exposure Hazardous Chemicals Laboratories also known OSHA Lab Other standard include hazard communication respiratory protection electrical fire safety
In addition general duty clause Section cover recognized hazard specific standard may exist ergonomics exposure anesthetic gas experimental drug
An important first step protecting worker health safety recognizing workplace hazard
Most hazard encountered fall three main category chemical biological physical
Cleaning agent disinfectant drug anesthetic gas solvent paint compressed gas example chemical hazard
Potential exposure chemical hazard occur use poor storage
Biological hazard include potential exposure allergen infectious zoonotics animal disease transmissible human experimental agent viral vector
Allergens ubiquitous animal research facility one important health hazard yet frequently overlooked
The final category contains associated research facility
The obvious slip fall working wet location ergonomic hazard lifting pushing pulling repetitive task
Other physical hazard often unnoticed electrical mechanical acoustic thermal nature
Ignoring potentially serious consequence
The use chemical research laboratory inevitable potential harm injury could significant misused mishandled
OSHA developed two important standard help mitigate potential problem
The first Hazard Communication standard deal requirement employer inform train employee use This would apply thing lab pump oil Chromerge liquid nitrogen used dewar
Although chemical found lab use meet criterion laboratory use
The second already mentioned
Known OSHA Lab Standard requires laboratory identify hazard determine employee exposure develop CHP including standard operating procedure
The lab standard applies laboratory use chemical mandate written Standard Operating Procedures SOPs addressing particular hazard precaution required safe use
This go hand hand experimental design planning
Both standard require providing material safety data sheet employee training
Biological hazard encompass microbe recombinant organism viral vector
They also include biological agent introduced experimental animal
Health safety issue containment ability replication potential biological effect important
When working biological hazard ensure procedure conducted safely
Much work recombinant DNA acute toxin select agent regulated federal agency Department Homeland Security Department Health Human Services including National Institutes Health
If facility conducting research area Institutional Biosafety Committee keep everything order running smoothly
The prevalent biological hazard term frequency occurrence simple allergen associated use care laboratory animal
Health survey people working laboratory animal show percent affected allergy
In survey worker animal facility percent allergic symptom related laboratory animal
These figure include former worker became ill could continue working
Research facility inherently significant physical hazard present
Included electrical safety hazard ergonomic hazard associated manual material handling equipment use handling sharp basic housekeeping issue
Many operation lab result lab worker assuming sustained repetitive awkward posture
Examples eluting column fume hood working extended period biosafety cabinet looking slide microscope extended period
What found acceptable brief occasional use may become problematic performed long duration frequently
Pain good indicator something wrong
Conduct work neutral balanced posture
Magnetic assist programmable pipette reduce frequency hand force required prevent worker injury
Sharps container ubiquitous research lab following safety rule help prevent getting stuck accident report
Use leakproof container clearly labeled
Train employee never remove cover attempt transfer content
Make sure container used sharp get replaced full prevent overfilling
Many injury stem poor housekeeping
Slips trip fall common easily avoided
Start safe organized storage area
Material storage create hazard
Bags container bundle stored tier stacked blocked interlocked limited height stable secure sliding collapse
Keep storage area free accumulation material could cause tripping fire explosion pest harborage
potentially life threatening found much frequently
First equip electrical power outlet wet location circuit interrupter GFCIs prevent accidental electrocution
GFCIs designed trip break circuit small amount current begin flowing ground
Wet location usually include outlet within six foot sink faucet water source outlet located outdoors area get washed routinely
Specific GFCI outlet used individually GFCIs installed electrical panel protect entire circuit
Another common electrical hazard improper use flexible extension cord
Do use substitute permanent wiring
The cord insulation good condition continue plug end
Never repair crack break cut tear tape
Either discard extension cord shorten installing new plug end
Take care run extension cord door window become pinched cut
And always aware potential tripping hazard using
Use grounded equipment tool never remove grounding pin plug end
Also use extension cord get right length cord job
The use hanging pendant electrical outlet widespread research lab facility help keep cord floor way
Check electrical pendant proper strain relief type box used
The box totally closed without hole
If contains knockout hole mounting right type hanging pendant
As final check possible electrical hazard look lighting
Protect light within seven foot floor guard accidental breakage
Slip plastic protective tube florescent bulb prior mounting install screen onto fixture
Research laboratory present many challenge
In bustle conducting research experiment worker health safety easily overlooked
However proper guidance trained eye practice noticing mundane find correct many common mistake prevent illness injury
The Internet provides vast amount valuable information easily researched
Begin OSHA website chance find need

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

fact sheet covering wide range workplace health safety topic hazard disease ergonomics workplace promotion
Download free OSH Answers app fact sheet The meaning word hazard confusing
Often dictionary give specific definition combine term risk
For example one dictionary defines hazard danger risk help explain many people use term interchangeably
There many definition hazard common definition talking workplace health safety A source damage harm adverse health effect something someone
The CSA Standard Occupational health safety Hazard identification elimination risk assessment control us following term physical injury damage health
potential source harm worker
Basically hazard potential harm adverse effect example people health effect organization property equipment loss environment
Sometimes resulting harm referred hazard instead actual source hazard
For example disease tuberculosis TB might called hazard general bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis would considered hazard hazardous biological agent
Workplace hazard come wide range source
General example include substance material process practice etc
ability cause harm adverse health effect person property
See Table
Workplace hazard also include practice condition release uncontrolled energy like chance probability person harmed experience adverse health effect exposed hazard
It may also apply situation property equipment loss harmful effect environment
The CSA Standard Occupational health safety Hazard identification elimination risk assessment control us following term combination likelihood occurrence harm severity harm
chance something happening
In risk assessment terminology word likelihood used refer chance something happening whether defined measured determined objectively subjectively qualitatively quantitatively described using general term mathematically probability frequency given time period
For example risk developing cancer smoking cigarette could expressed Factors influence degree likelihood risk Risk assessment process The OSH Answers document detail conduct assessment establish priority
A general definition adverse health effect change body function structure cell lead disease health problem
Adverse health effect include Not necessarily
To answer question need know The effect acute meaning injury harm occur felt soon person come contact hazardous agent splash acid person eye
Some response may chronic delayed
For example exposure poison ivy may cause red swelling skin two six hour contact plant
On hand longer delay possible mesothelioma kind cancer lining lung cavity develop year exposure asbestos
Once hazard removed eliminated effect may reversible irreversible permanent
For example hazard may cause injury heal completely reversible result untreatable disease irreversible

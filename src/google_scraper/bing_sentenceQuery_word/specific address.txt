Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I understand separate network address
Are DSN submask network broadcast address enough identify network
Networks need specific address support routing
Routers configured send traffic different interface depending network address
They usually care specific host unless router subnet host
For example send traffic PC home router forward ISP next level router
That router likely directly connected destination traffic forwarding another router closer
This based network part address host
Network address also important route summarization allows routing table shorter important hundred thousand route involved

Follow u The previous discussion becomes little clearer understand memory address work computer hardware
If read already would good time read fully understand bit byte word
All computer also known
For example computer might megabyte RAM installed right
RAM hold program computer currently running along data currently manipulating variable data structure
Memory thought simply array byte
In array every memory location address address first byte followed
Memory address act like index normal array
The computer access address memory time hence name random access memory
It also group byte together need form larger variable array structure
For example floating point variable consumes contiguous byte memory
You might make following global declaration program This statement say Declare location named hold one floating point value
When program run computer reserve space variable somewhere memory
That location fixed address memory space like While think variable computer think specific address memory example
Therefore create statement like The compiler might translate Load value memory location
The computer always thinking memory term address value address
There way several interesting side effect way computer treat memory
For example say include following code one program The output see program probably look like Why incorrect
If look carefully code see loop writing one element past end array
In memory array placed adjacent one another shown Therefore try write exist system writes instead ought
When write really writing u
As far computer concerned simply address write
As see however even though computer executes program correct valid
The program corrupts array process running
If execute following statement severe consequence result The location likely outside program memory space
In word writing memory program
On system protected memory space UNIX Windows sort statement cause system terminate execution program
On system Windows Mac however system aware
You end damaging code variable another application
The effect violation range nothing complete system crash
In memory u placed next one another specific address
Therefore write past boundary variable computer say end corrupting another memory location
Because C perform sort range checking access element array essential programmer pay careful attention keep within array appropriate boundary
Unintentionally reading writing outside array boundary always lead faulty program behavior
As another example try following This code tell compiler print address held along address The variable start crazy value
The address generally large value
For example I ran code I received following output mean address
Once statement executed contains address
Try well This code tell compiler print value point
However initialized yet contains address random address
In case error result mean used pointer point invalid area memory
Almost always uninitialized pointer bad pointer address cause segmentation fault
Having said look pointer whole new light
Take program example Here happening The variable consumes byte memory
The pointer p also consumes byte machine use today pointer consumes byte memory
Memory address long today although increasing trend toward addressing
The location specific address case
The pointer p hold address say
The variable therefore equivalent
The pointer literally hold address
When say something like program come actual address variable

Later take closer look understand computer address
How computer get IP address
An IP address either dynamic static
A static address one configure editing computer network setting
This type address rare create network issue use without good understanding
Dynamic address common
They assigned Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP service running network
DHCP typically run network hardware dedicated DHCP server
Dynamic IP address issued using leasing system meaning IP address active limited time
If lease expires computer automatically request new lease
Sometimes mean computer get new IP address especially computer unplugged network lease
This process usually transparent user unless computer warns IP address conflict network two computer IP address
An address conflict rare today technology typically fix problem automatically
Next let take closer look important part IP address special role certain address

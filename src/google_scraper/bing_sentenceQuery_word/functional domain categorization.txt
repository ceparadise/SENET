In style building structure element treat evaluation avoids data
It paradigm mean programming done declaration instead
In functional code output value function depends passed function calling function twice value argument produce result time contrast depending may produce different result different time called argument different program state
Eliminating change state depend function input make much easier understand predict behavior program one key motivation development functional programming
Functional programming origin developed investigate function definition
Many functional viewed elaboration lambda calculus
Another declarative programming paradigm based
In contrast change state command simplest example
Imperative programming mathematical sense
They may change value program state
Functions without therefore make sense
Because lack language expression result different value different time depending state executing program
Functional programming language largely emphasized rather commercial software development
However prominent programming language support functional programming also known used industrial commercial application wide variety organization
one world widely distributed language property untyped functional language addition imperative paradigm
Functional programming also supported like statistic financial analysis
Widespread declarative language like use element functional programming especially eschewing
Programming functional style also accomplished language specifically designed functional programming
For example imperative programming language subject book describing apply functional programming concept
This also true programming language
added construct facilitate functional style
The language also offer functional programming ability
An interesting case frequently written functional style presence side effect mutable state place grey area imperative functional language
provides theoretical framework describing function evaluation
It mathematical abstraction rather programming form basis almost current functional programming language
An equivalent theoretical formulation commonly perceived abstract lambda calculus preceded invention
Combinatory logic lambda calculus originally developed achieve clearer approach
An early language developed late scientific computer MIT
Lisp first introduced many paradigmatic feature functional programming though early Lisps incorporated support numerous programming style new paradigm evolved
Later dialect offshoot sought simplify rationalise Lisp around cleanly functional core designed preserve update paradigmatic feature numerous older dialect replaced
IPL sometimes cited first functional programming language
It manipulating list symbol
It notion amount function accepts function argument since language code data IPL regarded function
However relies heavily mutating list structure similar imperative feature

In previously worked Iverson created used commercially financial industry along descendant
presented lecture Can Programming Be Liberated From Style
A Functional Style Algebra Programs
He defines functional program built hierarchical way mean combining form allow algebra program modern language mean functional program follow
Backus paper popularized research functional programming though emphasized rather style associated functional programming
In created initially developed language later language
Also Edinburgh Burstall Darlington developed functional language
NPL based first introduced work program transformation
Burstall MacQueen Sannella incorporated polymorphic type checking ML produce language
ML eventually developed several dialect common
Meanwhile development simple impurely functional dialect Lisp described influential classic textbook brought awareness power functional programming wider community
In developed also called type theory associated functional program arbitrarily complex mathematical proposition expressed
This led powerful new approach influenced development many subsequent functional programming language
The began consensus form functional programming research implementation release ongoing since
A number concept paradigm specific functional programming generally foreign including
However programming language often hybrid several programming paradigm programmer using mostly imperative language may utilized concept
function either take function argument return result
In calculus example function return function
function closely related function function allow function argument result function
The distinction two subtle describes mathematical concept function operate function computer science term describes programming language entity restriction use thus function appear anywhere program entity like number including argument function return value
function enable technique applies function argument one time application returning new function accepts next argument
This let programmer succinctly express example addition operator partially applied one
expression memory
This mean pure function several useful property many used optimize code While compiler imperative programming language detect pure function perform elimination pure function call always library generally expose information thus preventing optimization involve external function
Some compiler add extra keywords programmer explicitly mark external function pure enable optimization
also let function designated
looping functional language usually accomplished via
invoke letting operation repeated reach
Though recursion requires maintaining stack recognized optimized compiler code used implement iteration imperative language
The language standard requires implementation recognize optimize tail recursion
Tail recursion optimization implemented transforming program compiling among approach
Common pattern recursion factored using higher order function fold unfolds obvious example
Such higher order function play role analogous control structure
Most general purpose functional programming language allow unrestricted recursion make cause unsoundness generally requires introduction logic expressed language
Some special purpose language allow recursion nonterminating computation expressed infinite stream value called
As consequence language fail Turing complete expressing certain function impossible still express wide class interesting computation avoiding problem introduced unrestricted recursion
Functional programming limited recursion constraint called
Functional language categorized whether use evaluation concept refer function argument processed expression evaluated
The technical difference expression containing failing divergent computation
Under strict evaluation evaluation term containing failing subterm fails
For example expression fails strict evaluation division zero third element list
Under lazy evaluation length function return value number item list since evaluating attempt evaluate term making list
In brief strict evaluation always fully evaluates function argument invoking function
Lazy evaluation evaluate function argument unless value required evaluate function call
The usual implementation strategy lazy evaluation functional language
Lazy evaluation used default several pure functional language including
argues lazy evaluation mechanism improving program modularity easing independent implementation producer consumer data stream
Launchbury describes difficulty lazy evaluation introduces particularly analyzing program storage requirement proposes aid analysis
Harper proposes including strict lazy evaluation language using language type system distinguish
Especially since development functional programming language tended use rejecting invalid program compilation time risking opposed accepts valid program compilation time risk used Lisp variant though reject invalid program runtime information enough reject valid program
The use make manipulation complex data structure convenient presence strong type checking make program reliable absence reliability technique like free programmer need manually declare type compiler case
Some functional language based let type depend term
Such type called
These type system decidable type inference difficult understand program
But dependent type express arbitrary proposition
Through program language become mean writing formal compiler generate
While language mainly interest academic research including begun used engineering well
subset written Coq formally verified
A limited form dependent type called GADT implemented way provides benefit dependently typed programming avoiding inconvenience
GADT available since version case class proposed addition language including Java C
Functional program assignment statement value variable functional program never change defined
This eliminates chance side effect variable replaced actual value point execution
So functional program referentially transparent
Consider assignment statement change value assigned variable
Let u say initial value two consecutive evaluation variable yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
In fact assignment statement never referentially transparent
Now consider another function transparent implicitly change input x thus
Functional program exclusively use type function therefore referentially transparent
It possible use functional style programming language traditionally considered functional language
For example explicitly support pure function
inception
Amrit Prem added support Python well closure Python though Python relegated reduce standard library module
function introduced mainstream language
In lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style
In sometimes used simulate however anonymous class always proper replacement limited capability
Java support lambda expression replacement anonymous class
However presence checked exception Java make functional programming inconvenient necessary catch checked exception rethrow problem occur JVM language checked exception Scala
In necessary lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style C
Many expressible functional programming term example simply dictate use function pattern roughly corresponds
Similarly idea immutable data functional programming often included imperative programming language example tuple Python immutable array
Purely functional often represented different way counterpart
For example constant access update time basic component imperative language many imperative based array
Arrays replaced admit purely functional implementation access update time
Therefore purely functional data structure used language may efficient tool especially persistence required
Functional programming different
The significant difference stem fact functional programming avoids used imperative programming implement state
Pure functional programming completely prevents provides
function rarely used older imperative programming
A traditional imperative program might use loop traverse modify list
A functional program hand would probably use map function take function list generating returning new list applying function list item
There task example maintaining bank account balance often seem naturally implemented state
Pure functional programming performs task task accepting user input printing screen different way
The pure functional programming language implement using derived
Monads offer way abstract certain type computational pattern including limited modeling computation mutable state side effect imperative manner without losing purity
While existing monad may easy apply program given appropriate template example many student find difficult understand conceptually asked define new monad sometimes needed certain type library
Another way functional language simulate state passing around represents current state parameter function call
On function call copy data structure created whatever difference result function
This referred
Impure functional language usually include direct method managing mutable state
example us managed reference updated applying pure function current state
This kind approach enables mutability still promoting use pure function preferred way express computation
Alternative method developed track side effect program
Some modern research language use make presence side effect explicit
Functional programming language typically le efficient use memory imperative language
This related fact mutable data structure like array straightforward implementation using present hardware highly evolved Turing machine
Flat array may accessed efficiently deeply pipelined CPUs prefetched efficiently cache complex handled SIMD instruction
It also easy create equally efficient immutable counterpart
For purely functional language slowdown logarithmic number memory cell used mutable memory represented purely functional data structure logarithmic access time balanced tree
However slowdown universal
For program perform intensive numerical computation functional language slightly slower C according
For program handle large multidimensional functional language designed speed optimization
Immutability data many case lead execution efficiency allowing compiler make assumption unsafe imperative language thus increasing opportunity
may also speed program even asymptotically whereas may slow constant factor however may introduce used improperly
Launchbury discus theoretical issue related memory leak lazy evaluation give practical advice analyzing fixing
However general implementation lazy evaluation making extensive use dereferenced code data perform poorly modern processor deep pipeline cache cache miss may cost hundred cycle
Imperative program environment sequence step manipulating environment
Functional program expression successively substituted reach normal form
An example illustrates different solution programming goal calculating
Printing first Fibonacci number using function Printing first Fibonacci number using closure Printing list first Fibonacci number generator Printing first Fibonacci number iterative Printing first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing list first Fibonacci number generator Printing list first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing list first Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style recursive list Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style primitive recursive list Printing Fibonacci number functional expression style primitive recursive list concisely Printing Fibonacci number functional declaration style Printing Fibonacci number functional declaration style using primitive As influenced Haskell others several functional declarative approach problem
For example declaratively build recursive version type constraint optional signature pattern matching An alternative construct lazy iterative sequence appears almost direct illustration sequence functional concurrent programming language
A algorithm implemented Erlang Note This demonstrating Erlang
Use algorithm fast performance functional concurrent programming language run
The Fibonacci function written Elixir follows The Fibonacci function written follows The program called The Fibonacci function written follows The program called Explicitly using infinite sequence Fibonacci number defined recursively
The Fibonacci function written follows The program called The Fibonacci function written follows SequenceL functional concurrent programming language
The Fibonacci function written SequenceL follows The function called To reduce memory consumed call stack computing large Fibonacci term version used
A function implemented SequenceL compiler looping structure The Fibonacci function written recursive function follows The Fibonacci function written bunch way Imperative Java style Recursive style slow Recursive style fast Using Scala stream Functional programming long popular academia industrial application
However recently several prominent functional programming language used commercial industrial system
For example programming language developed company late originally used implement telecommunication system
It since become popular building range application company
The dialect used basis several application early computer recently applied problem training control
introduced seen commercial use area financial analysis verification industrial programming static analysis
though initially intended research language also applied range company area aerospace system hardware design web programming
Other functional programming language seen use industry include hybrid support purely functional imperative programming
Functional programming used method teach problem solving algebra geometric concept
It also used tool teach classical mechanic

Throughout book going using technique called We ca give complete definition term yet chapter introduce building block functional programming Basically mean function thing high school algebra teacher meant except function necessarily relate number
But essential idea like kind function described
In example name function function take called number number
In chapter going use computer explore function going use standard Scheme notation rest book
That chapter want separate idea function complexity programming language notation
For example real Scheme notation let write expression involve one function chapter use one time
To get chapter special computer interface first start running Scheme first chapter type tell Scheme read program using
If trouble loading program look Appendix A information
Then start program type You able carry interaction like following
In text printed type type printing As see different function different number argument
In example added two number took square root one number
However every function give exactly one result time use
To leave program type asks function
Experiment arithmetic function
Try different kind number including integer number decimal fraction
What try divide zero
Throughout chapter going let experiment function rather give long boring list one work
The boring list available reference page
Try These suggestion
Be creative type example
Not Scheme function deal number
A broader category argument including number also including English word like
Even meaningless sequence letter digit considered word
Try function accept word argument
What happens use number argument one
So far function fall one two category arithmetic function require number argument return number result word function accept word argument return word result
The one exception seen
What kind argument accept
What kind value return
The technical term kind data In principle could think almost anything type number contain digit
Such type legitimate sometimes useful also official type Scheme know
Types overlap example number also considered word
The technical term thing function accepts argument function
The name thing function return So domain word range number fact nonnegative integer
This example show range may exactly one standard data type nonnegative integer type Scheme
How talk domain range function
You could say example The function number domain number range
Or informally may also say take number argument return number
For function two argument language little le straightforward
The informal version still work take two integer argument return integer
But ca say The domain two integer domain function possible argument statement characteristic legal argument
By way making certain simplification chapter
For example Scheme function actually accept number argument two
But want go bell whistle start adding two number time
Here example illustrate domain function We going introduce data type function include type domain range
The next type bunch word enclosed parenthesis Do include punctuation character within sentence
Many function accept word domain also accept sentence
There also function accepts word sentence
Try example like sentence
Other important function used ask question
That range function contains two value one meaning true meaning false
Try numeric comparison function work word sentence
The question mark part name function
There also function whose domain range value
The two value true false called named George Boole developed formal tool used value mathematics
What good value
Often program must choose two option If number positive negative
Scheme function make choice based value
For experiment function
Its first argument must true false others anything
So far data type include number word sentence Booleans
Scheme several data type consider one
A used data
Here example The range nonnegative integer
But domain For example try using argument
If used computer programming language may seem strange use part computer data
Most language make sharp distinction program data
soon see ability treat function data help make Scheme programming powerful convenient
Try example Think carefully
You applying function sentence applying function function sentence
Other function used include whose domain integer whose domain everything
If reading book trying thing computer go along get work
Spend time getting used idea thinking
When done read ahead
The idea heart mathematics computer science
For example mathematician want think formally system number use function create integer
They say let suppose one number called zero let suppose given
By applying function repeatedly create
Functions important computer science give u way think simple English way think something happening something changing
A function embodies information taking something know returning something know
That computer They transform information produce new result
A lot mathematics taught school number seen function number
used function word sentence even function function
You imagine function transform information kind function French window function capital California
You done lot thinking function
You add two number make sense add two word number
Some function complicated domain acceptable value one argument depend specific value used one
The function example make sure tried positive negative number fractional well power
Part definition function always get answer whenever call function argument
The value returned function word change regardless anything else may computed meanwhile
One function explored chapter real function according rule one
The rule may seem restrictive indeed often convenient use name function loosely process give different result different circumstance
But see sometimes important stick strict definition refrain using process truly function
We hinted two different way thinking function
The first called Here function rule tell u transform information information
The function rule thing right
The actual thing word number whatever function manipulates
The second way thinking called In view function perfectly good thing
We use function argument another function example
Research college math student show second idea hard people worth effort see function function like make program much easier write
As homey analogy think carrot peeler
If focus attention want peeler represents process
We peeling carrot
We applying function carrot
It carrot count
But also think peeler thing right clean worry whether blade sharp enough
The big idea explored chapter although used lot Chapter function using result one function argument another function
crucial idea write large program defining bunch small function composing produce desired result
We start next chapter return real Scheme notation
In line following table left one piece information
Fill missing detail
What domain function
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
Make sure try lot case
Hint Think name
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
The following exercise ask function meet certain criterion
For convenience function chapter
List function chapter type return value always different type argument
List function chapter type return value sometimes different type argument
Mathematicians sometimes use term operator mean function two argument type return result type
Which function seen chapter satisfy definition
An operator possible argument
For example commutative
Which operator Exercise commutative
An operator possible argument
For example associative
Which operator Exercise associative
Certain punctuation character also used word let defer detail gotten know word function simpler example
Unless version Scheme complex number
Real mathematician say The domain Cartesian cross product integer integer
In order avoid mouthful use informal wording
Yes English word
It astronomy

Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO
ontology considered upper ontology used linguistic tool learning domain ontology

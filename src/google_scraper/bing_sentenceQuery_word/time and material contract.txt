Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê ÿÿÿÿ Contracts The New Policies Overview T contract least preferred contract type may play important role helping Government meet need certain situation namely possible time placing contract estimate accurately extent duration work anticipate cost reasonable degree confidence
To ensure appropriate effective use T contracting overview emphasizes following key point Before using T contract contracting officer CO must establish contract type suitable
A CO may use T contract simply establishing service offered T basis
The CO must affirmatively establish suitable acquire service using contract type considering T contracting arrangement
COs need clearly carefully document finding written determination finding D F
This documentation help establish T contract used properly also provide appropriate insight circumstance vehicle needed
COs must recognize need become known must maximize use contracting form context commercial item acquisition mean economic price adjustment contract
Reliance favored contract type ensure contractor bear risk requirement known
COs familiarize use alternate clause FAR Alternate I term condition designed T contract
The alternate clause developed address payment inspection acceptance access record T environment
I
Restrictions Use T Contracts A
Basic Restrictions All T Contracts
T contract used CO executes D F contract type suitable FAR
A CO may use T contract simply establishing service offered T basis commercially offered rate fair reasonable
The CO must first affirmatively establish suitable acquire service using contract type
For commercial item requirement met establishing suitable acquire service using either contract contract economic price adjustment
The FAR explains demonstration may made establishing possible time placing contract estimate accurately extent duration work anticipate cost reasonable degree confidence FAR c
Example A critical piece power generation hardware failed
No one know happened
It important bring power back quickly possible
It possible time placing contract estimate accurately extent work necessary repair hardware
As result difficult obtain service basis fair reasonable price
Market research show type repair generally done T contract
In case CO may decide use T contract
Example A lawn Government facility must fertilized cut six month
Market research show company generally provide work T M basis
Company price basis fertilize cut lawn generally range per visit
As CO estimate accurately extent duration work anticipate cost reasonable degree confidence
Thus T contract appropriate contract
Commercial T Contracts
The law authorized use T contract commercial item requires awarded using competitive procedure
Any procedure described FAR comply requirement sealed bid competitive proposal order multiple award schedule
Other procedure competitive procedure include procedure FAR Subpart competition FAR Part b
B
Determination Findings D F All T Contracts The CO must execute D F contract type suitable FAR
b The D F must signed base contract awarded option exercised
If T contract option period exceed three year D F base contract must approved Head Contracting Activity HCA FAR
Example A CO enters base contract option
The CO must prepare D F prior entering contract also must prepare D F prior exercising option
However HCA approval D F required contract
Example A CO enters base contract three option
The CO must prepare D F prior entering contract also must prepare D F prior exercising option
In addition HCA must approve D F prior entering base contract base plus option period exceeds three year
Commercial T Contracts contract
If contract authorizes use T order The contract must structured maximize use order minimize use T order c
Each T order must authorized separate D F c
If contract authorizes T order basic contract D F must approved one level CO c
Example A CO enters basic contract commercial item provides T M order
Order Number basis
Order Number entered T M basis
A D F must prepared prior entering Order Number
However D F required Order Number
Example A CO enters basic contract commercial item provides T M order
The CO must prepare D F prior entering basic contract D F must approved one level CO
However D F required order prepared contract
For commercial T M contract D F must also include following FAR b Market research
Describe market research conducted
Duration extent work cost estimated
State possible accurately estimate extent work duration work anticipated cost
Fixed pricing portion work
Describe requirement structured maximize use economic price adjustment contract limiting value length T contract order establishing fixed price portion requirement future acquisition similar requirement
The use arrangement ensure contractor bear risk requirement known
Future related effort use fixed price
Describe action planned maximize use economic price adjustment contract future acquisition requirement
Example The Government need procure substantial amount material need installed different environment
The amount material needed reasonably extent duration time required install material estimated reasonably accuracy
The CO establishes line item purchase material T M line item installation
Example Repairs major piece equipment needed basis
The repair require assessment damage determine extent work required perform repair
However assessment performed historical experience show possible reasonably estimate cost repair
To justify use T assessment CO document use contract type T contract suitable
The CO may enter T line item assessment line item performing actual repair
Ceiling Price
Each T contract must include ceiling price contractor may exceed
For noncommercial contract CO required justify reason amount change ceiling price
For commercial contract CO required execute determination best interest procuring agency change ceiling price b ii C
The noncommercial justification commercial determination must documented contract file
II
Payments On T Contracts
The payment clause commercial T contract Alternate I FAR
The payment clause noncommercial T contract FAR
In addition clause FAR noncommercial T contract must also include Allowable Cost Payment Clause FAR
The Allowable Cost Payment Clause applies material portion T contract
As result FAR included contract contract material
Subcontracts All T Contracts
The following apply commercial noncommercial item contract All labor hour performed prime contract meet requirement labor category category prime contract paid fixed rate set prime contract regardless whether labor hour performed prime contractor subcontractor
The contract may identify separate rate contractor subcontractor
See following paragraph b
Example A contract includes fixed hourly rate installation service electrical engineer
The prime contractor enters subcontract Company A perform installation service using electrical engineer meet qualification electrical engineer specified prime contract
These subcontract labor hour must reimbursed fixed hourly rate specified contract
b Labor hour performed subcontractor reimbursed actual cost
Most subcontractor labor hour defined rather The exception subcontract supply incidental service labor category specified contract
Such supply incidental service included definition reimbursed actual cost
Example A prime contractor enters subcontract transportation service
The contract contain fixed hourly rate transportation service
This subcontract must reimbursed actual cost
Commercial T Contracts Hourly Rates
The contract may include A single rate labor category b Separate rate contractor subcontractor affiliate c Any combination b
Example Contract XYZ includes following rate Engineer Company A Engineer Company B In case prime contractor paid hour worked qualified engineer Company A hour worked qualified engineer Company B
Example Contract PQR includes single blended rate follows Engineer All In case prime contractor paid hour worked qualified engineer regardless whether engineer work prime contractor subcontractor
Noncommercial T Contracts Hourly Rates Contract Not Awarded Competitive Basis
The contract must separate rate contractor subcontractor affiliate
Example In structuring contract sole source acquisition CO deciding whether include single rate Contract KLM engineer per hour regardless whether engineer work prime contractor subcontractor
Such arrangement appropriate
The contract must include separate rate work performed prime engineer separate rate work performed subcontractor
Contract Awarded Competitive Basis FAR Rule
Unless otherwise specified agency procedure contract may include A single rate labor category b Separate rate contractor subcontractor affiliate c Any combination b
The CO mandate use one method authorized agency procedure
DFARS Rule
For competitively awarded noncommercial T contract order awarded behalf DoD DoD procedure require contractor bid separate labor hour rate contractor subcontractor affiliate DFARS
B
Materials
defined FAR commercial item FAR noncommercial item include direct material including supply transferred division subsidiary affiliate common control subcontract supply incidental service labor category specified contract direct cost incidental service labor category specified contract travel computer usage etc
applicable indirect cost
All T Contracts If contractor furnishes material meet definition commercial item price paid material shall exceed established catalog market price
b All material reimbursed based actual cost
Fee profit paid material
Noncommercial T contract
Payment material subject provision FAR Subpart effect date contract
Other Direct Costs ODC All T Contracts
ODC reimbursed based actual cost
Commercial T Contracts Only type ODC specifically listed contract reimbursed contractor
For example travel authorized CO would list paragraph FAR Alternate I ii D Other Direct Costs
Any limitation travel also listed
If reimbursement ODC provided CO insert contract clause
Example The contract includes following list Travel Computer Usage The contractor submits payment invoice includes printing cost
Payment printing cost permitted since printing cost listed specific ODC contract
b For contract CO awarding contract may list element direct cost basic contract may provide order separately list element ODC
Indirect Costs Noncommercial T Contracts
Indirect cost reimbursed actual cost
Commercial T Contracts Indirect cost paid based actual cost
Instead fixed amount indirect cost negotiated contract FAR Alternate I ii D paid basis period contract performance
The CO must insert fixed amount payment schedule contract clause
If reimbursement indirect cost provided CO insert contract clause
b The fixed amount total amount indirect cost paid contract
c The fixed amount determined contract competitive negotiation process
Offerors propose amount offer negotiation process proceed contract include amount result negotiation
For contract CO awarding contract may specify fixed amount indirect cost provide order separately fix amount payment schedule
Example The contract provides reimbursement indirect cost
The contract period month
The expenditure material expected spread evenly contract period
Thus contract state contractor reimbursed per month divided indirect cost contract
In Month contractor submits bill additional indirect cost claiming actual indirect cost applicable contract higher anticipated
Payment additional permitted since indirect cost limited specified contract
Prompt Payment
Prompt Payment Act penalty late payment apply All Commercial T contract Noncommercial T contract service
III
Inspection Correction Defects A
All T Contracts
If contractor provides service material meet requirement contract Government may require contractor replace correct service material anytime six month time listed contract date CO authorized representative approved related voucher
Except provided inspection acceptance clause contract contractor must paid reperformance Government requires correction replacement
The following limit apply payment reperformance Noncommercial T Contracts
The hourly rate labor performed contractor correct defect shall reduced reflect portion rate attributable profit
Commercial T Contracts
The hourly rate labor performed contractor correct defect shall reduced reflect portion rate identified clause FAR Alternate I
The CO negotiate percent used reduce hourly rate contract order executed
If contracting party unable negotiate percentage time contract award labor rate reduced percent
Government Access Records Noncommercial T M Contracts
The Government standard access record clause FAR
B
Commercial T Contracts
The Government access record necessary verify FAR Alternate I paragraph That employee met specification labor category billed The employee worked hour shown invoice Amounts paid actual cost basis reimbursement

Your contractor present either one two type contract sign
One fixed point fixed price contract
The time material contract
Depending scope solar window roofing project time material contract may best option
Understanding go time material contract one important aspect something aware
Here example time material contract great project time fixed point contract would better option
A time material contract used difficult provide accurate estimate project scope expected change often course construction
Keep mind instance rare
The homeowner agrees pay cost labor material used work done
If project clearly example simply upgrading time material contract would make sense either ask fixed point contract look another contract refuse define scope
Since charged time important agree upon hourly rate contractor member team
For example rate include time spent shopping material working project
This spelled contract
The definition material also clearly stated avoid unrelated charge added final bill
Often time homeowner contractor agree set maximum cost maximum price contractor exceed
To help decided whether time material contract right listed common pro con signing time material contract
When time material contract presented seasoned solar HVAC roofing window contractor effective fixed point contract
This course depends upon contractor team scope project
You already know talk contractor reference may good idea ask type contract signed pleased choice
A contractor charge homeowner correct mistake contractor team made
Unless otherwise stated contract nothing protecting homeowner
Fixing mistake extends time portion contract work need added scope fix project also requires material fix mistake
This style contract also cover cost replacing material stolen job site important consider
The homeowner save money project completed earlier expected
In fixed price contract bonus completing project estimated date
While necessarily bonus pay labor longer necessary may feel like one
The contractor may define everything billable hour homeowner disagrees
If agree upon time material contract sure agree upon count billable hour
Also make sure ask bill transportation job site including running hardware store
With time material contract need fill extra paperwork scope project change
This save time contractor see something addressed right away change mind often project
However trying keep eye cost project ask contractor still get approval changing scope

Time material contract frequently used staff augmentation organization need labor type staff order complete project task
Generally contract based imprecise statement work relatively specific deliverable
Cost calculated estimated number hour specified price per hour labor type estimate expense passed along without markup
The schedule usually detailed although almost always end date somewhere
In short vehicle quickly getting contingent worker board rather plan
And project manager whether managing labor supplying thing need consider
Consider three fundamental dimension project scope cost schedule
Of three important
Before start work contract try
In case unmovable date must met every consideration secondary
For example replacing old financial accounting system go operation first day fiscal year
In case minimum viable product contract provide specialty skill required deliver key element required scope
In still case business case
Understand dimension least flexible order understand option two
If contracting someone excavate build form place rebar pour concrete foundation building would extensive specification plan drawing quality standard
There would doubt good enough done looked like
Under T M contract deliverable labor hour rather tangible product
Consequently quality must specified task level
For example request training plan prepare group worker use new process specify want plan reviewed specific change requested
Otherwise specialized labor might end commodity labor editing
Similarly get contract programmer create custom process consider whether every possible condition must automated
It might cost effective corner case event handled manually
In typical staff augmentation contract travel expense part I seen contract travel estimate much labor estimate
But consider possibility work completed
Why incur travel cost order someone sit hall cube huddled laptop forty hour week
We collaboration tool allow u manage project globally distributed team conference call Webex document sharing tool like SharePoint Central Desktop
Also common day specialized knowledge worker several project billing hour week
Why pay work week travel order get work day labor
And vendor lose productivity travel time
Under T M contract customer retains risk
It uncommon contingent labor cost expand point make overall project failure
The sponsor expects project manager understand manage contract source labor well expense
The key understand cost driver contingent labor keep control
Dave Gordon project manager twenty five year experience implementing human capital management payroll system including SaaS solution like Workday ERP solution like PeopleSoft ADP Enterprise
He MS IT concentration project management BS Business
He also hold project management professional PMP designation well professional designation human resource GPHR SPHR benefit administration CEBS
In addition article blog post curate weekly roundup article project management authored contributed several book project management

T M contract may used acquiring supply service
These contract provide payment labor cost basis fixed hourly billing rate specified contract
These hourly billing rate would include wage indirect cost general administrative expense profit
There element T M contract fixed hourly billing rate
But contract also operate contract sense labor hour worked paid flexible
Materials billed cost unless contractor usually sell material type needed contract normal course business
In case payment provision provide payment material basis established catalog list price effect material furnished
These contract also may provide reimbursement material handling cost indirect cost procurement inspection storage payment etc
These indirect cost billed percentage material cost incurred similar billing overhead cost percentage direct labor
Such material handling cost must segregated separate indirect cost pool contractor accounting system must included indirect cost included part fixed hourly billing rate direct labor
It would always prudent obtain audit contractor accounting system determine adequacy system properly segregate material handling cost overhead cost billed fixed hourly rate labor
There full discussion time material contract FTA Best Practices Procurement Manual
The Common Grant Rule governmental recipient permit use time material contract determining contract type suitable contract specifies ceiling price contractor may exceed except risk
This T M contract incentive contractor control cost time money spent profitable contractor
Even contract preferable respect since fix amount fee dollar performance contract cost overrun result profit contactor
If competitive procurement advertised fixed price contract negotiate T M contract without amending solicitation allowing company offer proposal basis
This represents material change procurement could well firm would proposed T M basis offer proposal fixed price basis
If award fixed price contract able change contract type later T M contract expect FTA reimburse added cost
FTA financial interest fixed price contract agency give away FTA interest without prior FTA approval
In word agency later pay something contract specified price unless course agency change contract
The Federal Acquisition Regulations FAR discussion Time Materials contract subpart b say material handling cost include cost clearly excluded labor hour rate
The labor hour rate would include direct labor cost salary overhead charge G A charge
In word material handling cost must segregated separate indirect cost pool overhead G A cost
Material handling cost would typically include function receiving inspection storage distribution material
You correct saying material handling rate usually le material cost
If contractor separate material handling pool negotiate advance agreement contract requiring pool well advance agreement component pool place cap ceiling rate adjustable downward time final cost audit
You use predetermined fixed material handling rate could interpreted impermissible contract
If contactor agree continues insist G A charge produce inequitable cost result agency could also buy material furnish contractor furnished material
This would void markup though would course administrative burden agency
You correct statement fee profit allowed except part fixed billing rate direct labor hour
To fix fee rate contract allow contractor bill actual cost material travel plus rate fee would constitute prohibited contract
A contractor allowed recover overhead cost direct cost material travel contractor accounting system clearly separated overhead cost associated direct cost material handling overhead pool overhead cost included overhead pool applied direct labor cost
In word must duplicate billing material handling overhead cost rate applied labor dollar material dollar
The Contractor must consistently charge contract using methodology
As far overhead cost applied travel would highly unusual Contractor accounting system separate overhead cost associated travel apply separate burden rate cost
We would think would virtually impossible segregate overhead cost travel type travel corporate manager traveling general business purpose trip
But contractor overhead pool consistently billed contract overhead pool audited independent auditor found proper accordance FAR Part principle would see acceptable
It correct Time Material T M CPPC type contract contractor disincentive control cost effort spends profitable job becomes
The CPPC type contract prohibited used Federal fund involved
The T M contract permissible may used grantee determines type contract suitable contract specifies ceiling price contractor shall exceed except risk
If contractual arrangement contractor reimbursed actual dollar cost whether cost labor material travel etc
matter promise apply predetermined add cost overhead profit illegal CPPC situation
For example agree contractor cost plus fixed fee contract pay actual labor cost plus predetermined fixed overhead rate
You must provide ability audit overhead rate fact adjust billing actual rate incurred
Likewise agree pay contractor cost plus fixed rate profit actual cost incurred
Both example unlawful CPPC agreement
You lawfully negotiate fixed fully loaded labor overhead profit hourly billing rate given type labor leave hour billed flexible amount uncertainty performing job warrant
The procurement regulation would tell monitor manage type contract closely sure contractor performing well
In example agreement negotiated front hourly billing rate labor overhead profit fixed T M contract
If however portion billing rate fixed predetermined fixed like overhead profit rate applied fixed portion billing labor cost CPPC contract
If Time Materials T M contract consider overrun condition contractor completed work problem control would advise trying renegotiate billing rate unfinished work delete estimated profit billing rate rather awarding new contract unfinished work
One potential problem changing type contract work originally T M contract question extricating contractor potential loss position T M contract
Someone reviewing file future might well raise question could legitimate issue contractor operating cost projected original contract billing rate negotiated
In T M contract contract price stated hour labor category specified contract
If work assigned differs originally defined thus requires different category hour party must change contract add new category hour agreed upon price particular hour
The contractor free use category charge contractor see fit
The contractor would delivering item different labor called contract
If work originally contracted contractor may charge different category different rate unless contract modification reflects agreement party change
There prohibition T M subcontract prime contract firm fixed price
In case prime contractor assuming risk subcontractor may perform
If prime contract cost reimbursement would prudent agency become involved point requiring consent subcontract since agency would bear risk thus cost overrun subcontractor
In latter case agency would want ensure type subcontract feasible also stringent control place prime manage monitor subcontractor work ensure satisfactory progress
A
A ceiling grantee obligation required Chapter VI c T M type contract
This contract must modified incorporate ceiling price exceeded without grantee written authorization

This present highest risk owner secure way contractor
Time material contract least desirable contract type federal government
When using time material contract following item could negotiated Some federal agency use time material contract although popular among governmental agency
Some agency use T M Contracts Time material contract federal government used contracting officer determines suitable contract issued contract includes exceed condition
The Federal Acquisition Regulations FAR explain demonstration may made establishing possible time placing contract estimate extent duration work accurately anticipate cost reasonable degree confidence
When using T M government must also perform surveillance contractor performance

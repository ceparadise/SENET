What fundamental difference predictive modeling clustering
according literature predictive modeling supervised learning aim construct model predict value target attribute
On hand clustering unsupervised method split data set couple group
In idea
finding target attribute actually trying categorize similar clustering
I know clustering make subgroup available data predictive modeling try find model predict value attribute unseen data based current available data
Could anyone explain difference two concept clearly
Thanks sometimes called learning teacher whereas left completely alone
split data training testing subsample used verifying computed model
Predictive regression model typically assign weight attribute
From compute internal evaluation metric necessarily correlate desired human judgment
Unsupervised learning clustering mostly treat attribute equal without external information one ca say attribute important

Predictive Modeling work constructive feedback principle
You build model
Get feedback metric make improvement continue achieve desirable accuracy
Evaluation metric explain performance model
An important aspect evaluation metric capability discriminate among model result
Many ingenuous analyst even check model accuracy
Once finished building model hurriedly map predicted value unseen data
This incorrect approach
Simply building predictive model motive
But creating selecting model give high accuracy sample data
Hence crucial check accuracy model prior computing predicted value
In industry consider different kind metric evaluate model
The choice metric completely depends type model implementation plan model
After finished building model metric help evaluating model accuracy
Considering rising popularity cross validation I also mentioned principle article
When talk predictive model talking either regression model continuous output classification model nominal binary output
The evaluation metric used model different
In classification problem use two type algorithm dependent kind output creates In regression problem inconsistency output
The output always continuous nature requires treatment
For classification model evaluation metric discussion I used prediction problem BCI challenge Kaggle
The solution problem irrelevant discussion however final prediction training set used article
The prediction made problem probability output converted class output assuming threshold
A confusion matrix N X N matrix N number class predicted
For problem hand hence get X matrix
Here definition need remember confusion matrix The accuracy problem hand come
As see two table Positive predictive Value high negative predictive value quite low
Same hold Senstivity Specificity
This primarily driven threshold value chosen
If decrease threshold value two pair starkly different number come closer
In general concerned one defined metric
For instance pharmaceutical company concerned minimal wrong positive diagnosis
Hence concerned high Specificity
On hand attrition model concerned matrix generally used class output model
Gain Lift chart mainly concerned check rank ordering probability
Here step build chart Step Calculate probability observation Step Rank probability decreasing order
Step Build decile group almost observation
Step Calculate response rate decile Good Responders Bad total
You get following table need plot chart This informative table
Cumulative Gain chart graph Cumulative Right Cummulative Population
For case hand graph This graph tell well model segregating responder
For example first decile however population responder
This mean lift first decile
What maximum lift could reached first decile
From first table article know total number responder
Also first decile contains observation
Hence maximum lift first decile could
Hence quite close perfection model
Let plot lift curve
Lift curve plot total lift population
Note random model always stay flat
Here plot case hand You also plot decile wise lift decile number What graph tell
It tell model well till decile
Post every decile skewed towards
Any model lift decile till minimum decile maximum decile good model
Else might consider sampling first
Lift Gain chart widely used campaign targeting problem
This tell u till decile target customer specific campaign
Also tell much response expect new target base
chart measure performance classification model
More accurately measure degree separation positive negative distribution
The score partition population two separate group one group contains positive negative
On hand If model differentiate positive negative model selects case randomly population
The would
In classification model fall higher value better model separating positive negative case
For case hand following table We also plot Cumulative Good Bad see maximum separation
Following sample plot The metric covered till mostly used classification problem
Till learnt confusion matrix lift gain chart chart
Let proceed learn important metric
This one popular metric used industry
The biggest advantage using ROC curve independent change proportion responder
This statement get clearer following section
Let first try understand ROC curve
If look confusion matrix observe probabilistic model get different value metric
Hence sensitivity get different two vary follows The ROC curve plot sensitivity specificity
specificity also known false positive rate sensitivity also known True Positive rate
Following ROC curve case hand
Let take example threshold refer confusion matrix
Here confusion matrix As see sensitivity threshold
This coordinate becomes point ROC curve
To bring curve single number find area curve AUC
Note area entire square
Hence AUC ratio curve total area
For case hand get AUC ROC
Following thumb rule We see fall excellent band current model
But might simply
In case becomes important validation

For model give class output represented single point ROC plot

Such model compared judgement need taken single metric using multiple metric
For instance model parameter model parameter coming model hence metric directly compared

In case probabilistic model fortunate enough get single number
But still need look entire curve make conclusive decision
It also possible one model performs better region performs better
Why use ROC metric like lift curve
Lift dependent total response rate population
Hence response rate population change model give different lift chart
A solution concern true lift chart finding ratio lift perfect model lift decile
But ratio rarely make sense business
ROC curve hand almost independent response rate
This two axis coming columnar calculation confusion matrix
The numerator denominator x axis change similar scale case response rate shift
Gini coefficient sometimes used classification problem
Gini coefficient straigh away derived AUC ROC number
Gini nothing ratio area ROC curve diagnol line area triangle
Following formula used Gini Gini good model
For case hand get Gini
This one important metric classification prediction problem
To understand let assume student likelihood pas year
Following prediction A B C Now picture
fetch pair two three student many pair
We pair AB BC CA
Now year end saw A C passed year B failed
No choose pair find one responder
How many pair
We two pair AB BC
Now pair concordant pair probability responder higher
Whereas discordant pair hold true
In case probability equal say tie
Let see happens case AB Concordant BC Discordant Hence concordant case example
Concordant ratio considered good model
This metric generally used deciding many customer target etc
It primarily used access model predictive power
For decision like many target taken KS Lift chart
RMSE popular evaluation metric used regression problem
It follows assumption error unbiased follow normal distribution
Here key point consider RMSE RMSE metric given N Total Number Observations
Beyond metric another method check model performance
These method statistically prominent data science
But arrival machine learning blessed robut method model selection

Though cross validation really evaluation metric used openly communicate model accuracy
But result cross validation provides good enough intuitive result generalize performance model
Let understand cross validation detail
Let first understand importance cross validation
Due busy schedule day I get much time participate data science competition
Long time back I participated TFI Competition Kaggle
Without delving competition performance I would like show dissimilarity public private leaderboard score
For TFI competition following three solution score Lesser better You notice third entry worst Public score turned best model Private ranking
There model I still chose final entry really worked well
What caused phenomenon
The dissimilarity public private leaderboard caused
nothing model become highly complex start capturing noise also
This noise add value model inaccuracy
In following section I discus know solution actually know test result
Cross Validation one important concept type data modelling
It simply say try leave sample train model test model sample finalizing model
Above diagram show validate model sample
We simply divide population sample build model one sample
Rest population used validation
Could negative side approach
I believe negative side approach loose good amount data training model
Hence model high bias
And give best estimate coefficient
So next best option
What make split training population train first validate rest
Then train test first
This way train model entire population however one go
This reduces bias sample selection extent give smaller sample train model
This approach known cross validation
Let extrapolate last example cross validation
Now try visualize validation work
This cross validation
Here go behind scene divide entire population equal sample
Now train model sample Green box validate sample grey box
Then second iteration train model different sample held validation
In iteration basically built model sample held validation
This way reduce selection bias reduce variance prediction power
Once model take average error term find model best
cross validation widely used check whether model overfit
If performance metric k time modelling close mean metric highest
In Kaggle competition might rely cross validation score Kaggle public score
This way sure Public score chance
Coding R Python similar
Here code Python This tricky part
We trade choose For small k higher selection bias low variance performance
For large k small selection bias high variance performance
Think extreme case Generally value k recommended purpose
Measuring performance training sample point le
And leaving validation batch aside waste data
give u way use every singe datapoint reduce selection bias good extent
Also cross validation used modelling technique
In addition metric covered article used metric evaluation classification regression problem
Which metric often use classification regression problem
Have used cross validation kind analysis
Did see significant benefit using batch validation
Do let u know thought guide comment section

In also called fraction relevant instance among retrieved instance also known fraction relevant instance retrieved total amount relevant instance
Both precision recall therefore based understanding measure
Suppose computer program recognizing dog photograph identifies eight dog picture containing dog cat
Of eight dog identified five actually dog true positive rest cat false positive
The program precision recall
When return page relevant failing return additional relevant page precision recall
So case precision useful search result recall complete result
In item hypothesis accepted rejected based number selected compared sample size absence corresponds respectively maximum precision false positive maximum recall false negative
The pattern recognition example contained type I error type II error
Precision seen measure exactness whereas recall measure completeness
In simple term high precision mean algorithm returned substantially relevant result irrelevant one high recall mean algorithm returned relevant result
In information retrieval scenario instance document task return set relevant document given search term equivalently assign document one two category relevant relevant
In case relevant document simply belong relevant category
Recall defined retrieved search precision defined retrieved search search
In task precision class
number item correctly labeled belonging positive class
sum true positive item incorrectly labeled belonging class
Recall context defined
sum true positive item labeled belonging positive class
In information retrieval perfect precision score mean every result retrieved search relevant say nothing whether relevant document retrieved whereas perfect recall score mean relevant document retrieved search say nothing many irrelevant document also retrieved
In classification task precision score class C mean every item labeled belonging class C indeed belong class C say nothing number item class C labeled correctly whereas recall mean every item class C labeled belonging class C say nothing many item incorrectly also labeled belonging class C
Often inverse relationship precision recall possible increase one cost reducing
Brain surgery provides illustrative example tradeoff
Consider brain surgeon tasked removing cancerous tumor patient brain
The surgeon need remove tumor cell since remaining cancer cell regenerate tumor
Conversely surgeon must remove healthy brain cell since would leave patient impaired brain function
The surgeon may liberal area brain remove ensure extracted cancer cell
This decision increase recall reduces precision
On hand surgeon may conservative brain remove ensure extract cancer cell
This decision increase precision reduces recall
That say greater recall increase chance removing healthy cell negative outcome increase chance removing cancer cell positive outcome
Greater precision decrease chance removing healthy cell positive outcome also decrease chance removing cancer cell negative outcome
Usually precision recall score discussed isolation
Instead either value one measure compared fixed level measure
combined single measure
Examples measure combination precision recall weighted precision recall variant DeltaP DeltaP
weighted arithmetic mean Precision Inverse Precision weighted Bias well weighted arithmetic mean Recall Inverse Recall weighted Prevalence
Inverse Precision Inverse Recall simply Precision Recall inverse problem positive negative label exchanged real class prediction label
Recall Inverse Recall equivalently true positive rate false positive rate frequently plotted curve provide principled mechanism explore operating point tradeoff
Outside Information Retrieval application Recall Precision argued flawed ignore true negative cell contingency table easily manipulated biasing prediction
The first problem using second problem discounting chance component renormalizing longer affords opportunity explore tradeoff graphically
However renormalizations Recall Precision geometric mean thus act like debiased
In context precision recall defined term set
list document produced query set
list document internet relevant certain topic cf

The measure defined
In field precision fraction retrieved document query For example text search set document precision number correct result divided number returned result
Precision take retrieved document account also evaluated given rank considering topmost result returned system
This measure called
Precision used percent relevant document returned search
The two measure sometimes used together provide single measurement system
Note meaning usage precision field information retrieval differs definition within branch science technology
In information retrieval recall fraction relevant document successfully retrieved
For example text search set document recall number correct result divided number result returned
In binary classification recall called
It viewed probability relevant document retrieved query
It trivial achieve recall returning document response query
Therefore recall alone enough one need measure number document also example also computing precision
For classification task term see definition compare result classifier test trusted external judgment
The term refer classifier prediction sometimes known term refer whether prediction corresponds external judgment sometimes known
Let u define experiment positive instance negative instance condition
The four outcome formulated follows Precision recall defined Recall context also referred true positive rate precision also referred PPV related measure used classification include true negative rate
True negative rate also called
Additionally predicted positive condition rate PPCR identifies percentage total population flagged example search engine returning result retrieved document document PPCR
It possible interpret precision recall ratio probability Note random selection refers uniform distribution appropriate pool document
mean selecting document set retrieved document random fashion
The random selection document set equally likely selected
Note typical classification system probability retrieved document relevant depends document
The interpretation extends scenario also need explanation
Another interpretation precision recall follows
Precision average probability relevant retrieval
Recall average probability complete retrieval
Here average multiple retrieval query
A measure combine precision recall precision recall traditional balanced This measure approximately average two close generally case two number coincides square divided
There several reason criticized particular circumstance due bias evaluation metric
This also known measure recall precision evenly weighted
It special case general measure real value Two commonly used measure measure weight recall higher precision measure put emphasis precision recall
The derived van Rijsbergen measure effectiveness retrieval respect user attache time much importance recall precision
It based van Rijsbergen effectiveness measure second term weighted harmonic mean precision recall weight
Their relationship
There parameter strategy performance metric information retrieval system area curve AUC
For retrieval user objective clear precision recall ca optimized
As summarized Lopresti comfortable powerful paradigm

When testing choosing correct performance measure imperative making sure model work correctly
In literature common use measure always used past without really judging whether best way measure performance current problem
The common problematic measure RMSE regression accuracy classification
The RMSE penalizes larger error smaller error
However problem response variable right skewed error severely affected data point right end tail
Example right skewed distribution
A way handle might use measure predicted true value
Similarly bad measure class highly imbalanced
In binary classification problem class B class A trivial achieve accuracy
That mistake I seen newcomer machine learning
There different measure handle imbalanced class
There recently published book regarding performance metric classification called
I would highly recommend one starting machine learning predictive modelling
Evaluating learning algorithm A classification perspective In case I going much detail individual measure since covered future post
However I cover two simple trick

When regression plot histogram response
If extremely skewed go instead RMSE

When classification check balanced class
If highly imbalanced use
Values close indicate better performance
So next time using RMSE accuracy make sure right thing

The attempt measure scholar
The index based set scientist cited paper number citation received publication
The index also applied productivity impact well group scientist department university country
The index suggested physicist tool determining relative quality sometimes called
The definition index scholar index published paper cited paper least time
Thus reflects number publication number citation per publication
The index designed improve upon simpler measure total number citation publication
The index work properly comparing scientist working field citation convention differ widely among different field
Formally function corresponds number citation publication compute index follows
First order value largest lowest value
Then look last position greater equal position call position
For example researcher publication A B C D E citation respectively index equal publication citation
In contrast publication index fourth paper citation
If function ordered decreasing order largest value lowest one compute index follows The index seen type fuzzy integral
Then common index number citation author seen function
The Hirsch index equivalent earlier metric used evaluating cyclist
The serf alternative traditional journal metric evaluation impact work particular researcher
Because highly cited article contribute determination simpler process
Hirsch demonstrated high predictive value whether scientist honor like membership
The grows citation accumulate thus depends academic age researcher
The manually determined using citation database using automatic tool
database provide automated calculator
Harzing program calculates based entry
From July provided within profile
In addition specific database database automatically calculate researcher working
Each database likely produce different scholar different coverage
A detailed study showed Web Knowledge strong coverage journal publication poor coverage high impact conference
Scopus better coverage conference poor coverage publication prior Google Scholar best coverage conference journal though like Scopus limited coverage publication
The exclusion conference proceeding paper particular problem scholar conference proceeding considered important part literature
Google Scholar criticized producing phantom citation including citation count failing follow rule combining search term
For example Meho Yang study found Google Scholar identified citation Web Knowledge Scopus combined noted additional citation reported Google Scholar journal conference proceeding significantly alter relative ranking individual
It suggested order deal sometimes wide variation single academic measured across possible citation database one assume false negative database problematic false positive take maximum measured academic
Hirsch suggested physicist value might typical advancement tenure associate professor major research university
A value could mean full professorship could mean fellowship higher could mean membership
The team found social scientist United Kingdom relatively low average
The full professor based data ranged law political science sociology geography economics
On average across discipline professor social science twice lecturer senior lecturer though difference smallest geography
Among scientific discipline listed Essential Science Indicators Citation Thresholds physic second citation space science
During period January February physicist receive citation among cited physicist world
The threshold space science highest citation physic followed clinical medicine molecular biology genetics
Most discipline fewer scientist fewer paper fewer citation
Therefore discipline lower citation threshold Essential Science Indicators lowest citation threshold observed social science computer science multidisciplinary science
Little systematic investigation made academic recognition correlate different institution nation field study
However Hirsch estimate year successful scientist outstanding scientist truly unique individual
However point value h vary different field
For highly cited scientist period Hirsch identified top life science order decreasing
Among new inductee National Academy Sciences biological biomedical science median
Hirsch intended address main disadvantage bibliometric indicator total number paper total number citation
Total number paper account quality scientific publication total number citation disproportionately affected participation single publication major influence instance methodological paper proposing successful new technique method approximation generate large number citation many publication citation
The intended measure simultaneously quality quantity scientific output
There number situation may provide misleading information scientist output Most however exclusive
Various proposal modify order emphasize different feature made
As variant proliferated comparative study become possible showing proposal highly correlated original although alternative index may important decide comparable CVs often case evaluation process

For individual tested condition disease attribute Each four fundamental number divided row sum column sum
This give eight basic ratio though come pair sum one
Each specific test result positive negative specific state condition used define ratio ratio Rather focusing data implies given tested individual measure quality test whole
That specific distinctiveness criterion specific assumption two group testing individual satisfy null hypothesis ask chance distinctiveness criterion satisfied

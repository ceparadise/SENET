In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

A metal fabricator produce connecting rod outer diameter inch specification
A machine operator take several sample measurement time determines sample mean outer diameter inch standard deviation inch

Calculate process capability index example

What figure tell process

Process Capability b
Because Cpk
The solution answer question

Have tried explain concept process capability someone look like two head
Try using following analogy explain subject easily
Imagine driving highway undergoing construction
The width vehicle successful Six Sigma practitioner many vehicle available variability process sigma mean normal distribution
The line defining driving lane specification limit
On day driving motorcycle
You greeted one narrow lane modular concrete barrier side
Driving middle lane plenty room either side
You even wander side side still room without getting close barrier
On Tuesday take compact car
This time much room barrier couple foot either side vehicle
This problem bit careful going beyond barrier process capability speak specification
Now fun begin
On Wednesday hop trip
This time hardly room either side vehicle
If stay centered lane run risk causing damage vehicle
Would try go speed limit barrier would slow
In process speak filling tolerance zone process variation even process centered might also good idea slow process
Just feeling better getting Wednesday drive asked drive time towing manufactured home behind
You extremely nervous almost room either side vehicle also must tow something take room entire driving lane
You outside lane specification start drive
It clear accompanied vehicle warning sign light job warn oncoming traffic also help identify potential hazardous situation like barrier
Today find alternate route
Consider warning vehicle company quality department
It looking customer
You take day recover stress week driving
What experienced varying degree capability ranging good capability motorcycle room roam inside lane poor capability towing manufactured home taking room available
Assume modular concrete barrier around foot wide
The vehicle average width All vehicle running straight lane process centered nominal target value
This equivalent typically called process potential calculated width specification vehicle divided variability barrier
Using value previously noted vehicle capability Which vehicle would prefer drive
The one highest capability motorcycle
Now consider variation
In example running vehicle process center thereby getting closer barrier specification limit one side
As approach barrier opportunity success lowered
This process performance distance center vehicle closest barrier divided distance center vehicle edge vehicle closest barrier
The reason use closest side one danger damaged
In situation motorcycle running foot away barrier would capability compact car would capability
You want close may scraping paint side car
In production environment risk sending defective product customer
With wiggle room manufactured home would ruined attempted go barrier intentionally accidentally
If process le even process centered make bad product
That leaf two option Now able explain process capability anyone new concept
And remember center process reduce variation increase process capability
Centered Performance This article originally published
I used similar example teaching process capability
This well written entertaining story style
However I real problem two statement
First get guy judging Cp without looking Cpk also
Take example motorcycle driving lane going opposite direction
The motorcycle I described still Cp motorcycle Monday entirely specification taking driving rule road
Cp give process owner idea potential imply anything actually IN THE PROCESS need look Cpk also graphical representation
Also statement use Cpk get damaged closest side implies get defect side
I sorry look side
You CAN making defect often depending much variation process
I always tell student look histogram spec shown good statistical software like Minitab give Cp Cpk
Good analogy I think use confused specification variability calculation
You wrote All vehicle running straight lane process centered nominal target value
This equivalent typically called Cp process potential calculated width specification vehicle divided variability barrier
Should width specification barrier divided variability vehicle
You correct
The specification barrier foot Vehicle Process foot Cp
I guess example movinf Feet Feet
Please check Cpk come
John I seen variation explanation client Six Sigma material
These explanation illustrate graphically analogously meaning
It explained Centigrade telling formula convert Fahrenheit never told temperature metric
All capability index probability meeting specification
This never said
IMO significant omission
John Evelyn It nice first step I respectfully suggest maybe place leave customer
One consideration certainty fixed width truck probability variance likely I wide
Process Capability mean matter wide time make sometimes perhaps many many try
Good analogy
I voice brook opinion start defining Process Specification What Process capability
Thank Sharing distance center vehicle closest barrier divided distance center vehicle edge vehicle closest barrier
In situation motorcycle running foot away barrier would capability compact car would capability
Please explain calculation

A process almost measurement fall inside specification limit process
This represented pictorially plot There several statistic used measure capability process pk pm
Most capability index estimate valid sample size used large enough
Large enough generally thought independent data value
The pk pm statistic assume population data value normally distributed
Assuming specification mean standard deviation respectively normal data USL LSL upper lower specification limit target value respectively population capability index defined follows
pk USL LSL pm USL LSL T C p USL LSL C pk USL x x LSL C pm USL LSL x T The estimator pk also expressed pk scaled distance midpoint specification range process mean
Denote midpoint specification range USL LSL
The distance process mean optimum LSL
The scaled distance k USL LSL k The absolute sign take care case LSL
To determine estimated value k estimate x
Note x USL
The estimator index adjusted factor C pk C p k
Since k follows C pk C p
This expressed numerically table ppm part per million ppb part per billion
Note reject figure based assumption distribution centered
We discussed situation two spec

This known case
There many case lower upper specification used
Using one spec limit called
The corresponding capability index Estimators pu pl obtained replacing x respectively
The following relationship hold pu pl
This represented pictorially Note also write pk min pl pu
The resulting formula confidence limit given
Confidence Limits C p C p eqnarray eqnarray degree freedom
pu upper C pu C pu denoting percent point function standard normal distribution
If known set
Limits pl obtained replacing C pu C pl
The variance obtained follows
Let But since x
The k factor found k x USL LSL C pk C p k We would like C pk least good process
If possible reduce variability center process
We compute C pu C pl using C pu USL x C pl x LSL
From see C pu smallest index
Note formula C pk C p k algebraic equivalent min C pu C pl definition
C npk min USL median median LSL p p C npm USL LSL p p median T p percentile data p percentile data
The use percentile justified mimic coverage pm standard deviation normal distribution
Note source may use coverage
For example npk statistic may given p percentile data p percentile data

Increasing number company looking build behavioral science team one located center business whole organization benefit
This make sense alternative behavioral insight tried individual specific department knowledge capability likely vary
To build behavioral capacity succeed company get vision scope right honest resource need consider capability requirement consider sourcing model find right home group clear governance
By following step company set behavioral unit whose insight applied throughout company
If interested behavioral economics probably heard one discipline founding father recently awarded Nobel prize economics
You might also sold insight behavioral science make
You may even piloted couple intervention organization asking What next You alone
Increasing number company looking build behavioral science team one located center business whole organization benefit
This make sense alternative behavioral insight tried individual specific department knowledge skill likely vary Someone marketing might use behavioral knowledge develop campaign time someone HR us focus employee engagement
Sales could developing behaviorally informed strategy operation look way cut cost
While initiative may produce success likely lack coordination optimization
Building embedded sustained behavioral science unit expertise resource heart organization increase chance knowledge shared coordination improved rather department trying thing outcome improved
Here six thing consider building behavioral science group organization
This first step exactly groundbreaking make le crucial
All best strategy policy plan start vision clear intend company benefit behavioral science
Getting vision scope right essential require ask pretty detailed question
Here get started At stage also important think behavioral science agenda
Having clear defined scope vision guide choice face building team
Once set clear realistic scope vital honest budget resource require time constraint
Have got fund bring expert
The market behavioral science specialized yet mature consultancy may expertise advise
If plan team initial period long make work couple month couple year
Being clear help direct resource program stand best chance early payback
With vision resource place ready When think behavioral science wonderful example successful collaboration It pool insight across social science including psychology sociology economics anthropology neuroscience
Your behavioral team successful collaboration various skill set function
Depending vision ambition set likely need team specific specialty
In experience good starting point balanced behavioral science unit typically includes Who need hire
Do look partner outside vendor
If posse competency need
What role responsibility
These question front mind thinking sourcing model
Each organization need current level competence different definite answer
The chance need evolve move lifecycle building behavioral science group
During early stage many organization rely external partner established expertise delivering behavioral solution
Be prepared seek partnership established academic specialized consulting group noted practitioner
Also sure academic partner motivated apply work real world consulting group genuinely skilled simply agency jumping behavioral economics bandwagon chosen practitioner show past work rather well read subject
Smart selection right partner greatly improve credibility initiative reduce risk blunder even failure
Ultimately challenge selecting best behavioral scientist option organization question cost competency versus scale reach
Of course serious building internal capability leave everything external partner
We advocate approach pair internal project manager external expert
With right support training internal project manager future behavioral analyst
Be sure ask external partner willingness help build internal competence
As behavioral capability evolves aim reduce dependence external partner replacing capability
But avoid cutting tie completely
Identify external partner share common value negotiate ongoing advisory role
There many place behavioral science group sit organization
An obvious place within existing operational excellence performance department
Transdev large global transport operator set behavioral science capability called CHANGE Transdev part Performance Development department
The arrangement work well many project closely related promoting efficiency increasing productivity well supporting Transdev competitive position
Alternatively human resource might right place
We recommend HR involved anyway view make good advocate demonstrating activity connect part business
But thinking really want embrace behavioral revolution creating chief behavioral officer
This might sound unnecessary company planning large volume strategic intervention certainly consider
The benefit clear fully recognized dedicated team direct connection CEO
The approval process governance put place behavioral science capability depend corporate culture risk appetite
Whatever may strongly recommended two thing Finally look opportunity piggyback established governance
If running enterprise portfolio process find way embedding behavioral science project approval process
Doing ensure organization considers behavioral impact required behavior change project undertakes
You may already considered point
But starting ready take first step recommend begin We certainly going guarantee following advice win Nobel prize anytime soon
But may earn organization different type plaudit reputation organization efficient effective behavioral science capability ethical sustainable delivers competitive advantage

study computer including design architecture us computation system control
The field includes engineering activity design computer hardware make computer system
It also theoretical mathematical activity design performance study system component mean technique like queueing theory estimation reliability availability system probabilistic technique
Since computer system often large complicated allow designer predict failure success without testing experimentation incorporated development cycle
Computer generally considered separate computer engineering although two overlap extensively area design study computer system
The major subdisciplines computer science traditionally architecture including level hardware design well hardware software component form computer system software program set instruction tell computer carry task subdivided software engineering programming language operating system information system database artificial intelligence computer graphic theory includes computational method one hand data structure
Computer science independent discipline date although electronic object study invented two decade earlier
The root computer science lie primarily related field electrical engineering mathematics
provides basic circuit idea electrical impulse input circuit combined produce arbitrary output
The transistor miniaturization circuit along invention electronic magnetic optical medium storage information resulted advance electrical engineering
source one key concept development idea information represented sequence zero one
In number represented sequence binary digit way number familiar decimal system represented using digit
The relative ease two state high low voltage realized electrical electronic device led naturally bit becoming basic unit data storage transmission
The developed century supplied designing circuit binary input value false true respectively terminology logic yield desired combination output
Theoretical work computability began provided needed extension design whole machine milestone specification theoretical device manipulates string British mathematician model computational power
Another breakthrough concept computer usually credited mathematician
This instruction well data stored fast access critical development modern computer
Previous thinking limited calculator approach instruction entered one time
The need user application provided main driving force early day computer science still great extent today
The difficulty writing program led first development allows programmer use instruction ADD symbol variable
Such program translated program known assembler binary encoding used computer
Other piece system software known linking loader combine piece assembled load machine main memory unit ready execution
The concept linking separate piece code important since allowed library program built carry common first step toward increasingly emphasized notion software reuse
Assembly language found sufficiently inconvenient language closer natural language invented easier faster programming along came need compiler program translate language program machine code
As programming language became powerful abstract building efficient compiler create code term execution speed storage became interesting computer science problem
Increasing use computer early provided development consist software automatically handle input output execution job
The historical development operating system summarized topic
Throughout history computer machine utilized two major application computational support scientific engineering discipline data processing business need
The demand better computational technique led resurgence interest numerical method area mathematics traced method devised several century ago physicist hand computation made validate theory
Improved method computation obvious potential revolutionize business conducted pursuit business application new information system developed consisted file record stored
The invention allows rapid access arbitrary record disk led cleverly designed file system also concept development sophisticated database management system commonly use
development optimal algorithm inserting deleting locating data major area theoretical computer science since beginning heavy use structure virtually computer compiler operating system file system
Another goal computer science creation machine capable carrying task typically thought requiring
goal known actually predates first electronic computer although term coined introduced early display data crude image paper plot CRT screen
Expensive hardware limited availability software kept field growing early computer memory required became affordable
A bit map binary representation main memory rectangular array point pixel picture element screen
Because first display used one binary bit per pixel capable displaying one two colour commonly black green black amber
Later computer memory assigned binary bit per pixel obtain colour
together display screen development graphic standard make software le led explosive growth field
Software engineering arose distinct area study late part attempt introduce discipline structure software design development process

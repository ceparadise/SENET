Below see I created list task first column stakeholder across top row
A also known
typically stand
Stakeholders play different role project broken following level accountability esponsible This person responsible completing effort required task
There several people responsible task report one accountable
ccountable This person ultimately accountable coordinating effort complete task

While tell band play type flower chosen input needed success task
In many project see person ultimately accountable task also responsible actually work task
This indicated row accompany
As imagine project Responsibility Accountability Matrix become complex
I simplified example restaurant manager florist following project management best practice create RACI chart project others managing
For project stakeholder task must identified
Then every task assigned varying level responsibility stakeholder
This recorded RAM RACI chart
While countless variation matrix understanding foundation presented help manage project success

If many people hand creation project use Responsibility Matrix keep track
By In large project may many people role completion project deliverable
Sometimes pretty straightforward one person writing document one person approving
In case may many people hand creation others need varying level approval
For complicated scenario involving many people helpful Responsibility Matrix
This help set expectation ensures people know expected
For instance need know whether member Steering Committee need approve Business Requirements document
The matrix lay
On matrix different role appear column deliverable listed row
If know people filling role place actual name matrix
Then use intersecting point describe role person responsibility deliverable
A simple matrix follows
A A C R A A R C R A A R R C A R R C R R The letter interpreted follows In table Project Definition document created project manager reviewed project team approved project sponsor project director steering committee
The Business Requirements created project team reviewed project manager project director approved project sponsor steering committee
The purpose matrix gain clarity agreement define column much detail make sense
For instance example could broken specific people make project team person given column
You could specify actual individual responsible creation Business Requirements
After matrix completed circulated approval everyone understands agrees role responsibility
If done early enough included Project Definition charter
If done little later created standalone project management deliverable

A RAM also known LRC describes participation various completing
It especially useful clarifying role responsibility project process
RACI derived four key responsibility typically used
Very often role task deliverable may also completing indicated matrix task deliverable role role completion
implied
Outside exception generally recommended role project process task receive one participation type
Where one participation type shown generally implies participation yet fully resolved impede value technique clarifying participation role task
There distinction role individually identified people descriptor associated set task may performed many people one person perform many role
For example organization may ten people perform role although traditionally project one project manager one time person able perform role may also able perform role
The matrix typically created vertical axis column task deliverable horizontal axis top row role
Another example maintenance reliability community There number alternative RACI participation type There also number variation meaning RACI participation type

January Even though primary stakeholder confirmed requirement understanding project sponsor happy feature All requirement gathered many different stakeholder one getting ownership giving final sign At last moment development team said one feature technically possible deliver
The architect said developer know We deadline approaching next week still regression test case written reviewed
Tester say informed prior regarding deadline set
Client asked one change denying pay change Project delayed get API time supposed made available client per agreement
Now asking penalty late delivery Client asking use latest version tool architect say work need completely code These common concern Project Manager face every day
And RACI matrix help
First let understand kind situation happens
Each project manager deal many stakeholder managing project
Each project stakeholder brings unique expertise power project
Project consists many activity task different stakeholder participate different level particular role making decision completing activity
To drive project success important communicate regarding role expectation project execution well advance
A typical software development project many stakeholder like Customer Delivery Manager Program Manager Product owner Scrum Master Project Manager Project Team
The project team made one Designers programmer Quality Assurance Executives Engineers Technical Lead Technical Architects
Each people play different role Project
However ensuring everyone know precise responsibility paramount project success
Involving right person right activity right crucial project success
A tool called RACI matrix help project manager clearly document communicate stakeholder role process well advance
RACI matrix describes participation various role completing task deliverable project business process
It especially useful clarifying role responsibility project process
RACI matrix simply role work RACI definition intersection point
It also help provide live feedback particular person root cause analysis take preventive corrective action
It important identify person accountable particular task activity responsible using RACI matrix
It important differentiate person accountable person responsible particular activity
Project Manager also need identify stakeholder need consulted making final decision stakeholder affected particular activity task need informed regarding update decision regarding activity
Let get clarity basic four term namely Responsible Accountable Inform Consult
Here exactly mean
Those work achieve task
There least one role participation type responsible although others delegated assist work required see also RASCI separately identifying participate supporting role
The one ultimately answerable correct thorough completion deliverable task one delegate work responsible
In word accountable must sign approve work responsibly provides
There must one accountable specified task deliverable
Those whose opinion sought typically subject matter expert communication
Those kept progress often completion task deliverable communication
RACI nothing acronym four term Responsible Accountable Consulted Informed
And RACI matrix associate term particular project activity process particular stakeholder
Let understand RACI using one real life example
In typical software development project TechJini say working Dynamic Website Development Project
In project say team member Project Manager X Technical Architect Y QA tester Business Analyst Technical Lead Engineers We stake holder like Delivery Manager BEARD team PMO Client Subject Matter Expert End User Finance Manager In project many activity follow many process mentioned
Writing Product Requirement Document PRD Getting approval PRD Designing Architecture Project Creating Technical Design Document Setup Environments namely Production Development QA Getting required Software license Getting required hardware resource Creating Test Cases Elaborating User Stories Writing creating Documents product feature Scrum Ceremonies Testing activity Code review Change Requests approval Updating status project steering committee client Goal setting project team Resource allocation User Acceptance Testing Change baseline All activity require decision making right need done right people utilizing power expertise
So list role head column activity row table
This create RACI matrix
In case RACI matrix look displayed image
This simple matrix easier understand particular role expected involved particular activity
We used color code particular word matrix namely R A C I
This give better visualization make even easier
Once RACI matrix ready analyzed properly resolve issue conflict role involvement
This way set right expectation team stake holder
You make clear upfront regarding important task person involved various level
Say example matrix clearly identified code review done responsibility team leader
However architect consulted activity need performed technical lead
Similarly requirement gathering primary responsibility Business Analyst per matrix
However Project manager consulted activity done Business Analyst
This way able reduce confusion risk upfront make clear team
If person already know expected chance getting thing done earlier time increase significantly
Thus RACI matrix help None important activity overlooked
Each process allocated sufficient staff
Everybody team clearly know responsibility role specifically particular project
Confirm work load equally divided team single member overloaded
In case anybody leaf project resource replaced quickly understand role particular task responsibility
RACI also used root cause analysis
Once identify root cause problem inform educate right person avoid mistake future giving proper feedback
Encourages teamwork clarifying role responsibility
Eliminate duplication effort
Reduce misunderstanding
Improve communication make sure people left
Determine ownership
Clarify activity task process
Reduce bad decision ensuring correct people involved
Clarify boundary
Improve view employee
RACI matrix also known Responsibility Assignment Matrix RAM Linear Responsibility Chart LRC

learn share knowledge build career
I would like ask rather general introductory kind question regarding inventory management
So I wondering anyone SO worked past inventory supply chain procurement management setting
What typical problem challenge one might find field computer science mainly algorithm data structure optimization employed deal
Could relevant operational research queue theory etc
I directly related field would need know CS applied domain
An internet search produce vague result I would greatly appreciate insight educated advice specific online resource even example
I hope ok ask high level question
Many thanks advance Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
I experience warehouse management system
Much sophisticated CS point view juicy optimization problem CS applied
For example reduce time spent pick order go warehouse collect good order desireable find shortest way go place warehouse boil traveling salesman problem
Another place CS applied inventory taking clever software product
INVENT Xpert allow random sample inventory taking reach accuracy required law mean instead going storage location count quantity stored small percentage location actually counted
This general question You probably need knowledge distributed computing depends big operation Replicating Databases knowledge traveling agent kind problem know better else dependent problem need solve
I think explain purpose question narrow answer something might helpful also many product requires lot customization hold need field
What typical problem It common multiple updating specific database time locking update procedure lose money customer
Database concurrency issue significant system work
Test real load
If expect different widget warehouse expect day day Thanksgiving get hit second hour particular widget test real data real volume end test item quantity turn count ca even one
Make sure addressed two issue way trustworthy system

Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind

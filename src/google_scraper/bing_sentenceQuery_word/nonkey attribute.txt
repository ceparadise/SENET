Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page

In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

I confused clustered index dense sparse
I searched source saying sparse dense also
What exactly
Clustering index applied record physically ordered nonkey field called clustering field
As clustering field nonkey one distinct record single clustering field value
The strategy clustering index There one entry clustering index distinct value clustering field containing value pointer first block data file record value clustering field
So clearly sparse index
Clustered indexing dense sparse
Lets see Quick recap clustered indexing done non key attribute sorted according attribute
Idea behind clustered indexing one entry per unique value pointer location find entry value Case non key attribute unique value It dense indexing give every value entry index tableÂ Case non key attribute uniqueÂ In case one entry every unique value index By posting answer agree

What archive attribute window file
What Archive file detail
This question appears
The user voted close gave specific reason As I understand basically variable sort work backed
So backup taken archive attribute set user modifies file archive attribute set meaning next backup taken rather backing every file file archive attribute searched backed
So short clever way ensure backup efficient complete

Is computer science
If like problem solving thing like playing puzzle game computer science definitely
Going field computer science lucrative career
Computer science listed Forbes
According computer scientist working United States made May averaged per year come per hour
The lowest paid made per year highest paid made per year
One way make career computer science get college degree computer science field study may cost per year according average cost total Carnegie Mellon University nation popular bachelor program getting computer science degree
That bad investment ask path take like going programming boot camp getting certificate learning
You take traditional route go University major Computer Science option include online class take get started computer science field would like certificate showing taken class may cost money
Companies like juggernaut online learning community
You also learn channel go specific topic Computer Science well
Let take look history behind field
A computer used known human computation majority human woman
As matter fact one first credited programmer history woman named Ada Lovelace wrote program computer
Charles best known inventor computer computer first binary programmable computer
brilliant mathematician well known lifetime
Today known conceiving modern computing helped victory World War Nazi Germany cracking unbeatable enigma machine machine Nazi Germany used send secret message back forth comrade
In short credited first computer scientist
Sadly died young age due poisoning believed suicide
Alan Turing Alonzo Church independently together introduced algorithm limit computed purely mechanical model computing
In Konrad Zuse developed world first functional program controlled computer
In created model computer architecture became known Von Neumann Architecture since model used computer design
In first computer science degree created Purdue University
Also Kenneth Iverson writes programming language
American Standard Code Information Interchange ASCII created allowed exchange data different manufacturer
I could probably write multiple article history computer science eventually people idea innovation event lead cool computer program currently like iPhone Facebook Instagram Snap Chat Tinder etc
There many algorithm used automate world
Here popular algorithm computer science curriculum
In computer science sorting algorithm algorithm put element list certain order considered one simplest sorting algorithm work repeatedly swapping adjacent element wrong order
With bubble sort algorithm able see largest element assuming sorting smallest largest top list array
Get C program GitHub sorting algorithm specifically comparison sort
The algorithm divide input list two part sublist item already sorted built left right front left list sublist item remaining sorted occupy rest list
Initially sorted sublist empty unsorted sublist entire input list
The algorithm proceeds finding smallest largest depending sorting order element unsorted sublist exchanging swapping leftmost unsorted element putting sorted order moving sublist boundary one element right
Get code selection sort GitHub also commonly spelled mergesort efficient sorting algorithm
Most implementation produce stable sort mean implementation preserve input order equal element sorted output
Merge sort divide conquer algorithm invented John von Neumann
Divide unsorted list n sublists containing element list element considered sorted
Repeatedly merge sublists produce new sorted sublists sublist remaining
This sorted list
Binary search one fundamental algorithm computer science
also known find position target value within
Binary search compare target value middle element array unequal half target lie eliminated search continues remaining half successful
If search end remaining half empty target array
Linear Search method finding specific element value list
It check every element sequentially find specific element value
algorithm traverse tree graph data structure
It start root go far possible along branch backtracking
graph search algorithm solves single source shortest path problem graph edge path cost producing shortest path tree
This created
In computer science data structure particular way storing organizing data computer used efficiently
list element
It variable special data structure hold many value type
For example array integer would look like image
A data structure computer science special tree satisfies heap property mean parent le equal child node minimum heap parent greater equal child node maximum heap
A pair set denoted V E
The edge connect pair vertex
Each vertex represented node
Trees special type graph loop self loop circuit
A tree node connected similar graph
It root subtrees consisting child parent node
So basically heap special tree special graph data structure

Tara Sinclair chief economist said
Yet spite incredibly high demand entirely clear education someone need land one coveted role
Do get degree data science
Attend bootcamp
Take Udemy course jump
I caught four expert area find someone teach data science better get degree
The general consensus
So thinking getting degree data science expert want know
The panel expert More support damning education Edwin Chen explained individual enter data science number angle Chen went back claim example experience learning data science The reason may need degree data science data scientist highly sought job really mashup different skill set rarely found together
Rob Hyndman offered little background data scientist traditionally trained Because data science involves mixture skill skill many university already teach tendency toward repackaging existing course coveted data science degree
Madsen captured skepticism I heard several interviewee Madsen belief much program value come creating choosing course So data scientist supposed sort dud program teach need know
Mirko Krivanek outlining indicator tip shoddy program
A recurring theme throughout conversation role theory
Randy Bartlett recommendation aspiring data scientist find university offer bachelor degree statistic
Learn bachelor level avoid getting mired theory While theoretical approach negative Bartlett Chen offered side argument claiming need certain amount theoretical structure grasp certain concept In article titled Todd Nevins provides list soft skill becoming common data scientist job requirement including Randy Bartlett also emphasizes importance skill criticizes university program often leaving skill together There real training talk client organize team lead analytics Data science still rapidly evolving field norm established unlikely every data scientist following path
A degree data science make break career

Data distinct piece information usually formatted special way
All software divided two general category data
Programs collection instruction manipulating data
Data exist variety form number text piece paper bit byte stored electronic memory fact stored person mind
Since people used word data mean computer information transmitted stored
Strictly speaking data plural single piece information
In practice however people use data singular plural form word mass noun like sand
The term data often used distinguish information textual information
For example application make distinction data file file contain binary data text file file contain ASCII data
Also important know data file file store database information whereas file index file data dictionary store administrative information known metadata

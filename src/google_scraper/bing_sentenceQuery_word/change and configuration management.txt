process establishing maintaining consistency product performance functional physical attribute requirement design operational information throughout life
The CM process widely used military organization manage change throughout system
Outside military CM process also used IT service management defined segment
CM applied life cycle system provides visibility control performance functional physical attribute
CM verifies system performs intended identified documented sufficient detail support projected life cycle
The CM process facilitates orderly management system information system change beneficial purpose revise capability improve performance reliability maintainability extend life reduce cost reduce risk liability correct defect
The relatively minimal cost implementing CM returned many fold cost avoidance
The lack CM ineffectual implementation expensive sometimes catastrophic consequence failure equipment loss life
CM emphasizes functional relation part subsystem system effectively controlling system change
It help verify proposed change systematically considered minimize adverse effect
Changes system proposed evaluated implemented using standardized systematic approach ensures consistency proposed change evaluated term anticipated impact entire system
CM verifies change carried prescribed documentation item system reflects true configuration
A complete CM program includes provision storing tracking updating system information component subsystem system basis
A structured CM program ensures documentation requirement design test acceptance documentation item accurate consistent actual physical design item
In many case without CM documentation exists consistent item
For reason engineer contractor management frequently forced develop documentation reflecting actual status item proceed change
This process wasteful term human resource minimized eliminated using CM
Configuration Management originated technical management discipline hardware material standard practice virtually every industry
The CM process became technical discipline sometime late DoD developed series called series subsequently issued
In series consolidated single standard known replaced pursuant general DoD goal reduced number military standard favor industry supported SDO
This marked beginning evolved widely distributed accepted standard CM
Now widely adopted numerous organization agency CM discipline concept include SE ILS CMMI project management method ITIL
Many function model redefined CM traditional holistic approach technical management
Some treat CM similar librarian activity break change control change management separate stand alone discipline
CM practice handling change systematically maintains time
CM implement policy procedure technique tool manage evaluate proposed change track status change maintain inventory system support document system change
CM program plan provide technical administrative direction development implementation procedure function service tool process resource required successfully develop
During system development CM allows track requirement throughout acceptance operation maintenance
As change inevitably occur requirement design must approved documented creating accurate record system status
Ideally CM process applied throughout
Most professional mix get confused AM inventory asset hand
The key difference CM AM former manage financial accounting aspect
The CM process item comprises five distinct discipline established
These discipline carried policy procedure establishing performing standard process
The process also activity add Release management delivery
The five discipline The traditional software configuration management SCM process looked upon practitioner best solution handling change software project
It identifies functional physical attribute software various point time performs systematic control change identified attribute purpose maintaining software integrity traceability throughout software development life cycle
The SCM process defines need trace change ability verify final delivered software planned enhancement supposed included release
It identifies four procedure must defined software project ensure sound SCM process implemented
They These term definition change standard standard essentially
The ITIL specifies use Configuration management system CMS CMDB mean achieving industry best practice Configuration Management
CMDBs used track Configuration Items CIs dependency CIs represent thing enterprise worth tracking managing limited computer software software license rack network device storage even component within item
The benefit includes able perform function like root cause analysis impact analysis change management current state assessment future state strategy development
Example system commonly identifies system include
For CM defined management security feature assurance control change made hardware software firmware documentation test test fixture test documentation throughout life cycle information system
CM information assurance sometimes referred ecure onfiguration anagement relies upon performance functional physical attribute IT platform product environment determine appropriate security feature assurance used measure system configuration state
For example configuration requirement may different function part organization Internet boundary versus one function internal local
Configuration management used maintain understanding status complex asset view maintaining highest level serviceability lowest cost
Specifically aim ensure operation disrupted due asset part asset overrunning limit planned lifespan quality level
In military type activity often classed mission readiness seek define asset available type mission classic example whether aircraft board aircraft carrier equipped bomb ground support missile defense
Configuration management used maintain configuration file
Example system include
Many system utilize define maintain configuration
A theory configuration maintenance worked practical implementation present day computer system software able perform real time repair well preventive maintenance
Understanding state asset major component essential element preventive maintenance used maintenance repair overhaul system
Complex asset aircraft ship industrial machinery etc
depend many different component serviceable
This serviceability often defined term amount usage component since new since fitted since repaired amount use life several limiting factor
Understanding near end life component major undertaking involving record keeping recent development software
Many type component use electronic sensor capture data provides live
This data analyzed board remote location computer evaluate current serviceability increasingly likely future state using algorithm predict potential future failure based previous example failure field experience modeling
This basis predictive maintenance
Availability accurate timely data essential order CM provide operational value lack often limiting factor
Capturing disseminating operating data various support organization becoming industry
The consumer data grown numerous complex growth program offered original equipment manufacturer OEMs
These designed offer operator guaranteed availability make picture complex operator managing asset OEM taking liability ensure serviceability
A number standard support include configuration management including More recently configuration management applied large construction project often complex huge amount detail change need documented
Construction agency Federal Highway Administration used configuration management infrastructure project
There configuration management tool aim document change order RFIs order ensure project stay schedule budget
These program also store information aid maintenance modification infrastructure completed
One application ccsNet tested case study funded Federal Transportation Administration FTA efficacy configuration management measured comparing approximately complete construction Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency LACMTA segment Red Line billion rail construction project
This study yielded result indicating benefit using configuration management project nature

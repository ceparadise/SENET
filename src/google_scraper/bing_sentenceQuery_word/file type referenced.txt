In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

Greetings
I done search regarding subject
I came across page I way developing desktop application I need implement file format store data way I want
I quite uncertain I go first
Anyone idea
How I benefit content link
What I know implementing
Thanks lot
Creating association mean anytime someone file extension program launched WinMain get file name open file whatever want
So WANT code installer
Pick extension one else using upset customer
In particular large number extension image sound video like
So go loaded machine photoshop ilk look registry file class key see extension already
Pick something ELSE
An easy way avoid common file pick extension longer char though may compatability issue OS matter
Thanks feedback
Err thing still confusing piece code provided link
Is giving direction
May I know piece code
A wild guess creates registry key set registry key new extension
Does application extension everytime
The MS File Explorer program others like coming across file extension look registry specifc location see program associated file extension
This code snippet set registry program find program
You need installation time
As I say allow someone see file Explorer double click run program
Okay
So mean nothing else I take care file extension creation thing setting registry key installation time
Heck give try see
I done LONG time I may step
Okay
Thanks lot
Hello I got node
look like C Files If start tool double click Hello professional try make tool colleague
I got XMLTreeView form load want display image folder work change code work

A recent discussion among participant Informal List Official Representatives centered around citing computer file reference footnote bibliography whether cite codebook file providing discussion citing primary secondary source
With respect last two concern appeared adequate response indicating better cite file opposed codebook one generally cite primary data source
However first concern required information OR meeting targeted next opportunity discussion
Note paper first presented OR Annual Meeting November revised meeting Poughkeepsie
There good bad news
The good news researcher beginning cite computer file reference section social science journal
The bad news every person cite data source another twenty thirty continue provide citation
This mean valuable data source indexed bibliographical service Social Science Citation Index importantly next researcher would like analyze data may sufficient information acquire
Despite effort provide researcher example information compile data file citation overwhelming majority continue describe data source within text article NOT citation reference section
The March issue first time major social science journal provided instruction section cite data file MRDF currently referred computer file
To see effort impact number computer file citation could visibly detected reference section I took two year sample
Out approximately article describing form secondary analysis computer file citation
One citation unique style see nevertheless included enough information gain access data
The point better err give information
IASSIST might also want sponsor announcement reminding researcher cite data source
This public announcement might read DO FORGET TO CITE YOUR COMPUTER FILES
It sent various social science journal space permitting likely would run
Another announcement might jointly sponsored several editorial board THE FOLLOWING EDITORIAL BOARDS ENDORSE THE PRACTICE OF CITING SOCIAL SCIENCE DATA SOURCES
The various Associations Newsletters might also vehicle type announcement
Individual IASSIST member contact editor discus importance citing computer data source reference
Point researcher OBLIGED cite source well printed one
In addition practice encouraged data source described within text article without also appearing reference section
Individual member contact review board author prepare oversee style manual including Chicago A Manual Style Kate Turabian A Manual Writers
Note As I preparing paper I discovered new manual put American Political Science Review entitled
Individual member assist ICPSR effort provide quality control bibliographic description data file accompanying documentation
Better control bibliographic element facilitates citation process
The ICPSR staff making valiant effort regard need guidance feedback
For example IASSIST member discover discrepancy bibliographic element title page presented citation verso title page pointed corrected
IASSIST member get involved national international group dealing standard associated computer publishing production access
Social science data producer minority compared computer software producer
Without active involvement visibility decision made exclude need social science data user
For example National Information Standards Organization committee known NISO Committee FF Computer Software Description includes information bibliographic citation computer software
However similar effort text data file
It possible discussion paper provide anything brief example detailed instruction component bibliographic citation provided article Dodd part three chapter Dodd
Using different editorial style following example bibliographic citation given
In case computer file question considered published work book equivalent even though computer file social science sewn glued binding always boxed sealed package
The composition citation according style respective publication adhered author exception bracketed information designating format

A new phenomenon brought computer technology called electronic journal
Computers changed way scholarly article created
For example article may prepared using computer word processing program sent colleague review via EMail computer network later returned author
Once completed submitted electronic journal computer storage access demand
An example electronic journal PACS Review
This journal focus public access computer system library make available patron use
Articles stored file PACS Forum server
The table content section Review sent PACS Forum user retrieve article interest following instruction contained section
published three time year editorial board copyrighted
It also feature special department review work
The first volume issue appeared January
Because standard past tradition fall behind technology capability produce work definitive guideline citing article appears electronic journal
However common sense plus building currently place make leap print manageable feat
The following example reflect article appeared

A recording discretely
Just word written paper information written computer file
There different designed different purpose
A file may designed store picture written message wide variety kind data
Some type file store several type information
By using computer program person open read change close computer file
Computer file may reopened modified copied arbitrary number time
Typically computer file organised keep track file enables people access
The word file derives Latin thread
File used publicly context computer storage early February In RCA advertisement describing new memory vacuum tube developed RCA stated result countless computation kept file taken
Such exists tube developed RCA Laboratories
Electronically retains figure fed calculating machine hold storage memorizes new one speed intelligent solution maze mathematics
In file denoted information stored
In early use underlying hardware rather content stored denominated file
For example disk drive denominated disk file
The introduction circa MIT concept managed several virtual file one storage device origin contemporary denotation word
Although contemporary demonstrates early concept file use greatly decreased
On modern file organized array
The file defined content since file solely container data although platform format usually indicated specifying rule byte must organized interpreted meaningfully
For example byte plain text file Windows associated either character byte image video audio file interpreted otherwise
Most file type also allocate byte allows file carry basic information
Some file system store arbitrary interpreted file system data outside file format linked file example
On file system done via database
All method however susceptible loss metadata format
At instant time file might size normally expressed number indicates much storage associated file
In modern operating system size whole number byte system limit
Many older operating system kept track number occupied file physical storage device
In system software employed method track exact byte count used special control character signal end text file
The general definition file require size real meaning however unless data within file happens correspond data within pool persistent storage
A special case file newly created file yet data written may serve kind file system accident result aborted disk operation
For example file link point typical system probably defined size seldom change
Compare also file size may obscure
This misleading really file system resource including device accessed like file still real distinction file core behave obscurity size one manifestation
As character device size
Information computer file consist smaller packet information often called line individually different share common trait
For example payroll file might contain information concerning employee company payroll detail record payroll file concern one employee record common trait related similar placing payroll information specific filing cabinet office computer
A text file may contain line text corresponding printed line piece paper
Alternatively file may contain arbitrary binary image may contain
The way information grouped file entirely designed
This led plethora le standardized file structure imaginable purpose simplest complex
Most computer file used create modify delete file use basis
The programmer create program decide file needed used often name
In case computer program manipulate file made visible computer user
For example user manipulates document file user personally name
Although content document file arranged format program understands user able choose name location file provide bulk information word text stored file
Many application pack data file single file called using internal marker discern different type information contained within
The benefit archive file lower number file easier transfer reduce storage usage organize outdated file
The archive file must often unpacked next using
The basic operation program perform file Files computer created moved modified grown shrunk deleted
In case computer program executed computer handle operation user computer also manipulate file necessary
For instance file normally created modified Microsoft Word program response user command user also move file directly using Windows computer CLI
In system program operate directly low level file
Only kernel deal file handle interaction file manner transparent program
The provides level mean interaction file simply filename instead
For example delete file file
There many link file removed considers file memory space free reallocated
This commonly considered security risk due existence
Any program us system function wipe file data
In modern computer system file typically accessed using name
In operating system name associated file
In others file anonymous pointed link name
In latter case user identify name link file false analogue especially exists one link file
Files link file located directory
However generally contain either list file list link file
Within definition paramount importance term file includes directory
This permit existence directory hierarchy directory containing
A name refers file within directory must typically unique
In word must identical name within directory
However operating system name may include specification type mean directory contain identical name one type object directory file
In environment file named file name path file directory must uniquely identify among file computer two file name path
Where file anonymous named reference exist within namespace
In case name within namespace refer exactly zero one file
However file may represented within namespace zero one name
Any string character may may name file link depending upon context application
Whether name depends type computer system used
Early computer permitted letter digit name file modern computer allow long name character containing almost combination letter unicode digit making easier understand purpose file glance
Some computer system allow file name contain space others
file name determined
Unix file system usually case sensitive allow application create file whose name differ case character
support multiple file system different policy regarding
The common file system multiple file whose name differ case user us edit file name
User application however usually allow user create multiple file name differing case
Most computer organize file hierarchy using folder directory catalog
The concept irrespective terminology used
Each folder contain arbitrary number file also contain folder
These folder referred subfolders
Subfolders contain still file folder thus building structure one master folder root folder name varies one operating system another contain number level folder file
Folders named file except root folder often name
The use folder make easier organize file logical way
When computer allows use folder file folder name also path identifies folder folder file folder resides
In path sort special used separate file folder name
For example illustration shown article path uniquely identifies file called folder called turn contained folder called
The folder file name separated slash example topmost root folder name path begin slash root folder name would precede first slash
Many computer system use file name help identify contain also known file type
On Windows computer extension consist dot period end file name followed letter identify type file
An extension identifies text file extension identifies type document documentation commonly
Even extension used computer system degree computer system recognizes heed vary system required system completely ignored presented
Many modern computer system provide method protecting file accidental deliberate damage
Computers allow multiple user implement control may may modify delete create file folder
For example given user may granted permission read file folder modify delete user may given permission read modify file folder execute
Permissions may also used allow certain user see content file folder
Permissions protect unauthorized tampering destruction information file keep private information confidential unauthorized user
Another protection mechanism implemented many computer When flag turned file accomplished computer program human user file examined modified
This flag useful critical information must modified erased special file used internal part computer system
Some system also include make certain file invisible flag used computer system hide essential system file user alter
Any file useful purpose must physical manifestation
That file abstract concept real computer system must real physical analogue exist
In physical term computer file stored type data storage device
For example store file
Hard disk ubiquitous form storage since early
Where file contain temporary information may stored
Computer file also stored medium case etc
The use also beginning rival hard disk drive
In operating system many file associated physical storage device
Examples file directory
These virtual file exist object within operating system kernel
As seen running user program file usually represented either
A File control block FCB area memory manipulated establish filename
passed operating system parameter used older IBM operating system early PC operating system including early version
A file handle generally either integer introduced around running ubiquitous
When computer file contain information extremely important process used protect disaster might destroy file
Backing file simply mean making copy file separate location restored something happens computer deleted accidentally
There many way back file
Most computer system provide utility program assist process become many file safeguard
Files often copied removable medium writable CDs cartridge tape
Copying file another hard disk computer protects failure one disk necessary protect failure destruction entire computer copy file must made medium taken away computer stored safe distant location
The method automatically make three grandfather file oldest copy file son current copy
The way computer organizes name store manipulates file globally referred Most computer least one file system
Some computer allow use several different file system
For instance newer MS Windows computer older file system old version Windows supported addition file system normal file system recent version Windows
Each system advantage disadvantage
Standard FAT allows file name plus extension space example whereas NTFS allows much longer name contain space
You call file NTFS FAT would restricted something like unless using FAT extension allowing long file name
program utility program allow user manipulate file directly
They allow move create delete rename file folder although actually allow read content file store information
Every computer system provides least one program native file system
For example File Explorer formerly Windows Explorer commonly used Microsoft Windows operating system Nautilus common several distribution Linux

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In computer file format layout term data within file organized
A program us data file must able recognize possibly access data within file
For example program call Web able process display file HTML file format appears Web page display file format designed Microsoft Excel program
A particular file format often indicated part file name file name
Conventionally extension separated period name contains three four letter identify format
A program us recognizes particular file format may may care whether file appropriate extension name since actually examine bit file see whether format layout one recognizes
There many different file format different program process file

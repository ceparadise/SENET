Iteration context computer programming process wherein set instruction structure repeated sequence specified number time condition met
When first set instruction executed called iteration
When sequence instruction executed repeated manner called loop
Iteration repetition process computer program usually done help loop
An example iteration programming language follows Consider database table containing student record
Each record contains following field If one want copy student record database print best way retrieve record iterate loop record
It executed using loop statement shown int first name last name table In example iterator starting first student record last student record

When designing algorithm may step need repeating
This known iteration displayed pseudocode flowchart
An plan set instruction solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm These building block help describe solution form ready
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Iteration programming mean repeating step
This often called loop
Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step This make designing algorithm quicker simpler need include lot unnecessary step

When designing program may instruction need repeating
This known iteration implemented programming using FOR WHILE statement
An plan set designed solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm Algorithms used help design perform particular task
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Algorithms consist step carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step The algorithm repeat step cereal milk eaten
This make designing algorithm quicker simpler include lot unnecessary step
Once algorithm designed perfected must translated code computer read
We create program algorithm
Algorithms consist step
Programs consist statement
A statement single instruction word single step
Iteration implemented programming using statement
In programming iteration often referred looping program iterates loop earlier step

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
We new Agile noticing user story usually get completed end iteration
Testers little time test story thoroughly idle part iteration
This seems wrong
What right way get user story tested
You likely problem testing included definition done story
You include testing story Sprint Backlog column kanban use one
Generally Scrum team include unit testing development work Quality Assurance QA User Acceptance Testing UAT defined process step story considered complete
When decomposing story Sprint Backlog may useful add explicit task backlog story
This make checklist item story completed task end Sprint counted incomplete
In many case experienced team include testing explicit item baked estimate part team definition done
In case testing requirement story considered complete rule applies testing done story incomplete
Furthermore many agile practitioner use kanbans track story team
Having unique column testing story must pas placed done column ensures visual reminder testing intrinsic process
Finally testing part adequate buffer testing included story estimate
When tester participate planning session testing part formal essential practice might overlooked
Testing throughout process
Testers If testing becomes integral team process le likely require testapaloozas end iteration
Additionally testing responsibility member team need pitch testing task behind schedule order complete story end Sprint
Create strong incentive whole team cognizant resource time requirement testing planning iteration
If testing stop something thrown wall tester end

act repeating process either generate unbounded sequence outcome aim approaching desired goal target result
Each repetition process also called iteration result one iteration used starting point next iteration
In context iteration along related technique standard building block
mathematics may refer process
applying function repeatedly using output one iteration input next
Iteration apparently simple function produce complex behaviour difficult problem example see
Another use iteration mathematics used produce approximate numerical solution certain mathematical problem
example iterative method
Manual calculation number square root common use example
computing technique marking block statement within defined number repetition
That block statement said computer scientist might also refer block statement iteration
The pseudocode example iteration line code bracket loop iterate three time It permissible often necessary use value part program outside bracketed block statement perform desired function
In example line code using value increment
In school iteration used describe process teaching guiding student repeat experiment assessment project accurate result found student mastered technical skill
This idea found old adage Practice make perfect
In particular iterative defined process learning development involves cyclical inquiry enabling multiple opportunity people revisit idea critically reflect implication
Unlike computing math educational iteration predetermined instead task repeated success according external criterion often test achieved
In algorithmic situation recursion iteration employed effect
The primary difference recursion employed solution without prior knowledge many time action repeat successful iteration requires foreknowledge
Some type programming language known designed set block statement explicit repetition loop
Instead programming language exclusively use
Rather call block code repeated number time executing code block instead divide work done number separate piece code block executes individual piece
Each piece work divided repeatedly amount work small possibly point algorithm work quickly
The algorithm revers reassembles piece complete whole
The classic example recursion algorithm
The Merge Sort recursive algorithm first repeatedly divide list consecutive pair pair ordered consecutive pair pair forth element list desired order
The code example recursive algorithm programming language output result pseudocode previous heading
In object ensures iteration executed way range different data structure saving time effort later coding attempt
An abstraction accepts reject data iteration

We using Agile Scrum methodology
For iteration coworker finish Development task carried last iteration
We thought done two day start black box testing
So two task one assigned finishing development one assigned run black box testing project
But task almost took whole iteration one day left obviously impossible task
So think
What I suggest project manager
I want name task whole iteration I blocked
We still partially finish like test plan task definitely
Development task carried last iteration thought done two day If task got carried last iteration I would say task large probably broken smaller task
You looking single task running two iteration
task almost took whole iteration one day left obviously impossible task There might lack communication
I find alarming saying day end iteration
Do already test plan place saying one day enough test feature test plan yet
Our tester normally raise issue three five day end iteration
I suggest project manager
I want name task whole iteration I blocked
First point I like make regarding impediment
If knew impeded unfinished feature Monday I would state project manager senior developer day
We whiteboard write name date time well person third party impeded
So could make clear day
A member team keep track impediment analysis weekly basis
This allows explain certain holdbacks business make improvement within team
Developer communicated team lead project manager make aware behind
At point running SCRUMs close X amount hour per day
Say I task estimated four hour I spent eight hour already
Project manager would run statistic daily basis day would clear PM I running behind odd man hour
So I say PM equally responsible
still partially finish like test plan task definitely
Now probably important point
Three twenty
Assuming test pas confident feature working
Would drive car knew break work time
You see point I trying make
I would personally recommend release feature gather relevant team member get feedback prior making change going next iteration
You need find going wrong fix
To summarise I think multiple people responsible issue including project manager developer
This based experience software engineer project manager
Your question suggests several We problem like time solution
Of course case impossible work task people
In case rest help item interrupted blocking item
Even finished end sprint everything could order solve issue
If improve wo happen agile
Back spend time solving issue happen later solve painful
Lots different thing could tried improve future iteration
My answer question since know specific team technology culture
Why one person task
Is everyone working individual task separate
How trying couple people one task
Especially taking multiple day I like give team goal breaking task thing accomplished day
This way checking thing every day
Many believe granular task predictable become scrum kanban two people
Was touch technology part code two people would reduced risk delay
come retrospective sprint
What action item come next time feature team effort
helping reach finish line concerned assigned
Are assigning individual task planning
What picked sprint drove feature completion suggestion
Good luck
This answer may development perspective building software using object oriented technique MVC also help dissolve issue
You coworker taken minute spec output part project would look like input would look like
You write stub simulate output coworker module
This mean work part project work point coworker complete part
Then integrate two piece
Without knowing detail hard give solid answer even working frontend component piece UI stubbed data used placeholder
This concept course lot successful follow Erin Danny suggestion break thing granular component
Not make easy develop independent module also make whole lot easier test component
When using Scrum using cross functional team member develop vertically testing user story part user story
If user story broken smaller task task dependant putting sprint cause delay
You could break black box testing smaller testing task complete sprint postpone others another sprint
However may better commit code behind original task integration branch feel tested enough
Does unit test
I think bigger problem particular task blockage scenario
If task blocked long come daily scrum Scrum Master anything remove impediment
If external dependency possible remove team updated concern dependent task could start
Also discussion individual responsibility mindset contrary team ownership Scrum promotes

What difference Scrum Agile Development
Are Sprint Iterations
Scrum one many iterative incremental agile software development method
You find detailed description process
In SCRUM methodology sprint basic unit development
Each sprint start planning meeting task sprint identified estimated commitment sprint goal made
A Sprint end review retrospective meeting progress reviewed lesson next sprint identified
During sprint team creates finished portion product
In Agile method iteration involves team working full software development cycle including planning requirement analysis design coding unit testing acceptance testing working product demonstrated stakeholder
So SCRUM sprint perform software development phase requirement analysis acceptance testing opinion say SCRUM sprint correspond AGILE iteration
As mentioned others Scrum iterative incremental agile software development method managing software project product application development
So Scrum fact type Agile approach used widely software development
So Scrum specific flavor Agile specifically referred agile project management framework
Also Scrum mainly two role inside
Role
Ancillary Role role It consists mainly three role
Scrum Master b
Product Owner c
Development Team
Ancillary Role The ancillary role Scrum team formal role infrequent involvement Scrum procession nonetheless must taken account
viz
Stakeholders Managers
Scrum Master There type meeting scrum Let know one need input
How Scrum fit Agile Development
While Agile methodology applied product development software industry industry well Scrum specific software development
Scrum methodology
It simply provides structure discipline framework Agile development
The whole project made series Sprints Sprint Cycles n Sprint duration
If denoted T Tn
Sprints could anywhere week
Sprints shorter week ideal used le frequently
At end Sprint functional working piece software produced user actually test
Original article SCRUM SCRUM type Agile approach
It Framework Methodology
It provide detailed instruction need done rather dependent team developing software
Because developing project know problem solved much left team essential case scrum
There team leader case assign task team member rather whole team address issue problem
It way everyone involved project right idea implementation project
The advantage scrum direction adjusted based completed work speculation prediction
Roles Involved Product Owner Scrum Master Team Members Agile Methodology Build Software application unpredictable nature Iterative incremental work cadence called sprint used methodology
Both Agile SCRUM follows system feature developed part sprint end sprint feature completed right coding testing integration product
A demonstration functionality provided owner end sprint feedback taken helpful next sprint
Manifesto Agile Development That value item right value item left
Agile Scrum term used project management
The Agile methodology employ incremental iterative work beat also called sprint
Scrum hand type agile approach used software development
Agile practice Scrum process following practice eXtreme Programming XP Kanban alternative process following Agile development practice
Waterfall methodology sequential design process
This mean eight stage conception initiation analysis design construction testing implementation maintenance completed developer move next step
As process sequential step completed developer go back previous step without scratching whole project starting beginning
room change error project outcome extensive plan must set beginning followed careful came disadvantage waterfall methodology
Instead sequential design process Agile methodology follows incremental approach
Developers start simplistic project design begin work small module
The work module done weekly monthly sprint end sprint project priority evaluated test run
These sprint allow bug discovered customer feedback incorporated design next sprint run
The process lack initial design step often criticized collaborative nature focus principle rather process
At outset I say Agile evolutionary methodology Unified Process focus Iterative Incremental Development IID
IID emphasizes iterative development construction phase actual coding incremental delivery
It would emphasize Requirements Analysis Inception Design Elaboration handled iteration
So Iteration mini project
In Agile take IDD bit adding reality like Team Collaboration Evolutionary Requirements Design etc
And SCRUM tool enable considering human factor building around Group principle
So Sprint mini project bettering pure IID model
So iteration implemented Agile way yes theoretically Sprints highlighting size iteration small delivery quick
I really differentiate Agile SCRUM I see SCRUM natural way putting Agile principle use

One topic seems come regularly mailing list online discussion merit lack thereof Computer Science Degree
An argument seems come time negative party coding number year never used recursion
So question This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built
By way Mario typical name ArrangeString function join I surprised language choice already implementation
Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division
In English definition say greatest common divisor number zero number greatest common divisor two number greatest common divisor remainder dividing
If like know work see Wikipedia article
Let compute gcd example
Each step equal one In first step equal zero second part definition applies
mod go remainder
At step second part applies time mod divide remainder
At step second argument answer
Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood
EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

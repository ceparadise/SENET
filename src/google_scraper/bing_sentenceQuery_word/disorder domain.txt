Menu Small Clinical Trial Supports Larger Scale Testing A training method teach person anxiety shift attention away threatening image reduced symptom anxiety small clinical trial child condition
The result first randomized clinical trial therapy child anxiety suggest approach warrant extensive testing promising therapy
As many quarter met criterion anxiety disorder point
Currently available cognitive behavioral therapy symptom anxiety percent child treated
Most child clinical anxiety receive treatment partly difficulty access care including distance financial resource
Scientists searching additional approach including therapy involve medication associated side effect
A treatment called attention bias modification ABM emerged observation people anxiety unconsciously pay attention others anything seems threatening
One way detecting bias dot probe test
In test people view computer screen angry neutral face flashed briefly adjacent
After face disappear test image dot appears either one face person respond pushing button
People anxiety consistently respond quickly dot appear angry face located
ABM present patient exercise similar dot probe test dot always appear neutral face thus consistently draw attention participant image
A recent ABM adult investigator carried work suggested potential treatment
Researchers Tel Aviv University TAU Israel carried clinical trial ABM outcome collaboration scientist National Institute Mental Health University Maryland College Park Maryland
Yair TAU led study appears The study enrolled child year old sought help anxiety
For child receiving ABM face appeared screen two dot appeared screen child determine whether dot side side one
In every case dot appeared neutral face
There also two control group first dot appeared equally frequently angry neutral face appeared second face appeared throughout neutral dot always appeared location neutral face
The object second control group help confirm therapeutic effect ABM training desensitizing child threatening face
Children study randomly assigned receive treatment one two control group
All child four training session week trial per session
Although trial small reasonably robust decrease severity anxiety according author
Following ABM number severity symptom reduced
An important feature ABM say NIMH author Daniel Pine address fundamental neurological function underlying anxiety attention
Changes attention happen millisecond
We know neuroscience want change behavior happen quickly practice
You tell someone drive throw ball
You practice say Pine
Longitudinal study follow child adulthood suggest chronic mood anxiety disorder adult begin high level anxiety child
In fact childhood anxiety important predicting adult depression adult anxiety
The ability influence attention bias early development might provide powerful mean prevention disorder later life
The approach requires medication practical term nature ABM lends dissemination medium child comfortable
trial able provide information efficacy treatment child work reduce symptom anxiety

A arrangement row column possibly complex structure
Tables widely used
Tables appear print medium handwritten note computer software architectural ornamentation traffic sign many place
The precise convention terminology describing table vary depending context
Further table differ significantly variety structure flexibility notation representation use
In book technical article table typically presented apart main text numbered captioned
A table consists ordered arrangement
This simplified description basic kind table
Certain consideration follow simplified description The element table may grouped segmented arranged many different way even nested
Additionally table may include header ancillary feature
The following illustrates simple table three column seven row
The first row counted used display column name
This called header row
The concept also part basic terminology
Any simple table represented table data value ordered
A common example table
In table cell body table value cell relates value beginning column
header row structure complex table
This combination value header row row lack better term header column column lack better term related unique cell table Tables described wide narrow format
As communication tool table allows form information unlimited number different social scientific context
It provides familiar way convey information might otherwise obvious readily understood
For example following diagram two alternate representation information presented side side
On left NFPA standard example value indicated right simple table displaying value along additional information
Both representation convey essentially information tabular representation arguably comprehensible someone familiar NFPA standard
The tabular representation may however ideal every circumstance example space limitation safety reason
There several specific situation table routinely used matter custom formal convention
Modern software application give user ability generate format edit table tabular data wide variety us example Tables us software development specification implementation
Usage software specification encompass ad hoc inclusion simple textual document use tabular specification methodology example include SCR Statestep
Proponents tabular technique among prominent emphasize understandability well quality cost advantage format allowing systematic inspection corresponding shortcoming experienced graphical notation cited motivating development least two tabular approach
At programming level software may implemented using construct generally represented understood tabular whether store data perhaps earlier result example determining flow program execution response various event input
Database system often store data structure called table column data field row represent data record
In medieval covered piece cloth count money
archaic term English institution accounted money owed
Thus table stack coin concrete realization

Facts dimension form core business intelligence effort
These table contain basic data used conduct detailed analysis derive business value
In article take look development use fact dimension business intelligence
Fact table contain data corresponding particular business process
Each row represents single event associated process contains measurement data associated event
For example retail organization might fact table related customer purchase customer service telephone call product return
The customer purchase table would likely contain information amount purchase discount applied sale tax paid
The information contained within fact table typically numeric data often data easily manipulated particularly summing together many thousand row
For example retailer described may wish pull profit report particular store product line customer segment
The retailer retrieving information fact table relates transaction meeting specific criterion adding row together
When designing fact table developer must pay careful attention grain table level detail contained within table
The developer designing purchase fact table retail organization described would need decide example whether grain table customer transaction individual item purchase
In case individual item purchase grain customer transaction would generate multiple fact table entry corresponding item purchased
The choice grain fundamental decision made design process significant impact business intelligence effort road
Dimensions describe object involved business intelligence effort
While fact correspond event dimension correspond people item object
In retail scenario used example discussed purchase return call fact
On hand customer employee item store dimension contained dimension table
Dimension table contain detail instance object
For example item dimension table would contain record item sold store
It might include information cost item supplier color size similar data
Fact table dimension table related
Again returning retail model fact table customer transaction would likely contain reference item dimension table entry corresponds table record describing item purchased

In simply consisting collection identified least one
An array stored position element computed index mathematical formula
The simplest type data structure linear array also called array
For example array integer variable index may stored memory address element index address
The memory address first element array called first address foundation address
Because mathematical concept represented grid array also sometimes called matrix
In case term vector used computing refer array although rather correctly mathematical equivalent
Arrays often used implement especially word sometimes used synonym
Arrays among oldest important data structure used almost every program
They also used implement many data structure
They effectively exploit addressing logic computer
In modern computer many device memory array word whose index address
especially often optimized array operation
Arrays useful mostly element index computed
Among thing feature allows single iterative process arbitrarily many element array
For reason element array data structure required size use data representation
The set valid index tuples address element hence element addressing formula usually always fixed array use
The term often used mean kind provided consists collection value variable selected one index computed
Array type often implemented array structure however language may implemented data structure
The term also used especially description mean abstract array model ADT intended capture essential property array
Arrays better cache locality compared
The first digital computer used programming set access array structure data table vector matrix computation many purpose
wrote first program building
Array indexing originally done later using
Some mainframe designed successor used perform checking hardware
Assembly language generally special support array machine provides
The earliest programming language including support array
In class template exist array whose dimension fixed runtime well array
Arrays used implement mathematical well kind rectangular table
Many small large consist include array whose element
Arrays used implement data structure list
implementation data structure frequently simple requiring little space may poor space complexity particularly modified compared data structure compare
One large array sometimes used emulate particularly allocation
Historically sometimes way allocate dynamic memory portably
Arrays used determine partial complete program compact alternative otherwise repetitive multiple statement
They known context used conjunction purpose built interpreter whose altered according value contained array
The array may contain relative subroutine number acted upon statement direct path execution
When data object stored array individual object selected index usually
Indexes also called subscript
An index array value stored object
There three way element array indexed Arrays multiple dimension thus uncommon access array using multiple index
For example array three row four column might provide access element row column expression case indexing system
Thus two index used array three array array
The number index needed specify element called dimension dimensionality array
In standard array index restricted certain range consecutive integer consecutive value address element computed linear formula index
A array single dimension array type linear array
Accessing element involves single subscript either represent row column index
As example consider C declaration Syntax datatype anArrayname sizeofArray In given example array contain element value available type
In C array element index inclusive case
For example expression first last element respectively
For vector linear addressing element index located address fixed fixed constant sometimes called
If valid element index begin constant simply address first element array
For reason specifies array index always begin many programmer call element rather first
However one choose index first element appropriate choice base address
For example array five element indexed base address replaced index element
If numbering start constant may address element
For multidimensional array element index would address coefficient respectively
More generally array address element index For example int This mean array row column array integer type
Here store element stored linearly starting first row linear continuing second row
The array stored
This formula requires multiplication addition array fit memory
Moreover coefficient fixed power multiplication replaced
The coefficient must chosen every valid index tuple map address distinct element
If minimum legal value every index address element whose index zero
As case element index may changed changing base address
Thus array row column indexed respectively replacing cause renumbered respectively
Taking advantage feature language like FORTRAN specify array index begin mathematical tradition language like Fortran Pascal Algol let user choose minimum value index
The addressing formula completely defined dimension base address increment
It often useful pack parameter record called array
The size element minimum maximum value allowed index may also included dope vector
The dope vector complete array convenient way pas array argument
Many useful operation selecting swapping index reversing direction index performed efficiently manipulating dope vector
Often coefficient chosen element occupy contiguous area memory
However necessary
Even array always created contiguous element array slicing operation may create
There two systematic compact layout array
For example consider matrix In order layout adopted C statically declared array element row stored consecutive position element row lower address element consecutive row In order traditionally used Fortran element column consecutive memory element column lower address element consecutive column For array three index row major order put consecutive position two element whose index tuples differ one index
Column major order analogous respect index
In system use scanning array much faster successive element stored consecutive position memory rather sparsely scattered
Many algorithm use multidimensional array scan predictable order
A programmer sophisticated compiler may use information choose layout array
For example computing product two matrix would best stored order order
Static array size fixed created consequently allow element inserted removed
However allocating new array copying content old array possible effectively implement version array see
If operation done infrequently insertion end array require amortized constant time
Some array data structure reallocate storage store count number element array use called count size
This effectively make array fixed maximum size capacity example
More complicated formula occasionally used
For compact instance addressing formula polynomial degree
Both take deterministic worst case
Arrays take linear space number element hold
In array element size machine cache line size B byte iterating array element requires minimum ceiling cache miss element occupy contiguous memory location
This roughly factor better number cache miss needed access element random memory location
As consequence sequential iteration array noticeably faster practice iteration many data structure property called mean however using within local array even faster achievable
Libraries provide optimized facility copying range memory used move block array element significantly faster achieved individual element access
The speedup optimized routine varies array element size architecture implementation
array compact data structure
There may overhead
store index bound
It also happen element stored array require memory element stored individual variable several array element stored single array often called array
An extreme commonly used case every bit represents single element
A single thus hold different combination different condition compact form
Array access statically predictable access pattern major source
similar array add ability insert delete element adding deleting end particularly efficient
However reserve linear additional storage whereas array reserve additional storage
provide mechanism functionality without huge storage overhead index value sparse
For example array contains value index billion may benefit using structure
Specialized associative array integer key include
require O log time indexed access also permit inserting deleting element O log time whereas growable array require linear Θ time insert delete element arbitrary position
allow constant time removal insertion middle take linear time indexed access
Their memory use typically worse array still linear
An alternative multidimensional array structure
It us array array one dimension le
For two dimension particular alternative structure would vector pointer vector one row
Thus element row column array would accessed double indexing typical notation
This alternative structure allows row may different size general valid range index depends value preceding index
It also save one multiplication column address increment replacing bit shift index vector row pointer one extra memory access fetching row address may worthwhile architecture
The dimension array number index needed select element
Thus array seen function set possible index combination dimension space domain discrete subset
Thus array list data array rectangle data array block data etc
This confused dimension set matrix given domain number element array
For example array row column matrix form space
Similarly vector represented array size three

What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing

Databases used organise data clear consistent way
Most website online application use database
With much data shared online data security important issue
The actual unit data entered give
These unit data also called
When create database need set data type
For example film database might need alphabetical character number
Fields usually restricted certain data type
way classifying data value common property
Different kind data value also need different amount store different operation performed upon
The data type In database programming language data type set follows The structure also called
When design database need create schema explain type data stored
There key area consider data Before creating database need think purpose
What database going used
What search might performed
In film table example structure table would If creating database people data type would use capture someone age
It would best capture age date birth DATE data type eg
An alternative would capture age number like
However need think database
If input someone age need update every time someone year older
This would inefficient time consuming
It would much better enter date birth

Follow u As probably noticed live world defined three spatial dimension one dimension time
In word take three number pinpoint physical location given moment
On coordinate break longitude latitude altitude representing dimension length width height depth
Slap time stamp coordinate pinpointed time well
To strip even world would like single bead measured thread
You slide bead forward slide bead backward need one number figure exact location string length
Where bead
It mark
Now let upgrade world
This essentially flat map like playing field game Battleship chess
You need length width determine location
In Battleship say know location convergence horizontal E line vertical line
Now let add one dimension
Our world factor height depth equation locating submarine exact location Battleship requires two number submarine would demand third coordinate depth
Sure might charging along surface might also hiding foot meter beneath wave
Which
Could fourth spatial dimension
Well tricky question currently ca perceive measure anything beyond dimension length width height
Just three number required pinpoint location world world would require four
At moment likely positioned particular longitude latitude altitude
Walk little left alter longitude latitude
Stand chair exact spot alter altitude
Here get hard Can move current location without altering longitude latitude altitude
You ca fourth spatial dimension u move
But fact ca move fourth spatial dimension perceive one necessarily rule existence
In mathematician Theodor Kaluza theorized fourth spatial dimension might link general relativity electromagnetic theory source
But would go
Theoretical physicist Oskar Klein later revised theory proposing fourth dimension merely curled three spatial dimension extended
In word fourth dimension rolled unseen little like fully retracted tape measure
Furthermore would mean every point world would additional fourth spatial dimension rolled away inside
String theorist however need slightly complicated vision empower superstring theory cosmos
In fact quite easy assume showing bit proposing dimension including time
Wait let blow mind yet
One way envisioning imagine point world contains retracted tape measure geometric shape
One example shape look bit like cross mollusk
Escher drawing Star Trek holiday ornament source
Think way A concrete wall look solid firm distance
Move closer however see dimple hole mark surface
Move even closer see made molecule
Or consider cable From distance appears single thick strand
Get right next find woven countless strand
There always greater complexity meet eye hidden complexity may well conceal tiny dimension
Yet remain certain three spatial dimension one time

Team science collaborative effort address scientific challenge leverage strength expertise professional trained different field
Although traditional driven approach ideal many scientific endeavor coordinated team investigator diverse skill knowledge may especially helpful study complex social problem multiple cause
Over past two decade emerging emphasis scientifically addressing problem climate change rise chronic disease health impact social stratification
This contributed surge interest investment team science
Increasingly scientist across many discipline setting engaging research initiative
These include small large team group effort engage multiple stakeholder scientist community member policy maker
Academic institution industry national government funders also investing team science initiative
A growing trend within team science science team member training expertise different field work together combine integrate perspective single research endeavor
team science identified mean engage expansive study address broad array complex interacting variable
It seen promising approach accelerate scientific innovation translation scientific finding effective policy practice
The success team science influenced variety contextual environmental influence
These factor influence stage scientific initiative implication efficiency productivity overall effectiveness
They include Narrow search resource type goal Team science expert write current issue field

also known branch pertaining evidence found computer digital
The goal computer forensics examine digital medium forensically sound manner aim identifying preserving recovering analyzing presenting fact opinion digital information
Although often associated investigation wide variety computer forensics may also used civil proceeding
The discipline involves similar technique principle additional guideline practice designed create legal
Evidence computer forensics investigation usually subjected guideline practice digital evidence
It used number case becoming widely accepted reliable within European
In early personal computer became accessible consumer leading increased use criminal activity example help commit
At time several new computer crime recognized
The discipline computer forensics emerged time method recover investigate use court
Since computer crime computer related crime grown jumped
Today used investigate wide variety crime including fraud murder rape
The discipline also feature civil proceeding form information gathering example Forensic technique expert knowledge used explain current state computer system storage medium

The scope forensic analysis vary simple reconstructing series event
In book author Kruse Heiser define computer forensics involving preservation identification extraction documentation interpretation computer data
They go describe discipline art science indicating forensic methodology backed flexibility extensive domain knowledge
However several method used extract evidence given computer strategy used law enforcement fairly rigid lack flexibility found civilian world
In court computer forensic evidence subject usual requirement
This requires information authentic reliably obtained admissible
Different country specific guideline practice evidence recovery
In examiner often follow guideline help ensure authenticity integrity evidence
While voluntary guideline widely accepted British court
Computer forensics used evidence since notable example include Computer forensic investigation usually follow standard digital forensic process phase acquisition examination analysis reporting
Investigations performed static data
rather live system
This change early forensic practice lack specialist tool led investigator commonly working live data
A number technique used computer forensics investigation much written many technique used law enforcement particular
When seizing evidence machine still active information stored solely recovered powering may lost
One application live analysis recover RAM data example using Microsoft tool windd prior removing exhibit
CaptureGUARD Gateway bypass Windows login locked computer allowing analysis acquisition physical memory locked computer
RAM analyzed prior content power loss electrical charge stored memory cell take time dissipate effect exploited
The length time data recoverable increased low temperature higher cell voltage
Holding unpowered RAM help preserve residual data order magnitude improving chance successful recovery
However impractical field examination
Some tool needed extract volatile data however require computer forensic lab maintain legitimate chain evidence facilitate work machine
If necessary law enforcement applies technique move live running desktop computer
These include move mouse rapidly small movement prevents computer going sleep accidentally
Usually UPS provides power transit
However one easiest way capture data actually saving RAM data disk
Various file system journaling feature keep large portion RAM data main storage medium operation page file reassembled reconstruct RAM time
A number open source commercial tool exist computer forensics investigation
Typical forensic analysis includes manual review material medium reviewing Windows registry suspect information discovering cracking password keyword search topic related crime extracting picture review
There several computer forensics certification available ISFCE Certified Computer Examiner Digital Forensics Investigation Professional DFIP IACRB Certified Computer Forensics Examiner
The top certification especially within EU considered Certified Cyber Forensics Professional
Others worth mention USA APAC IACIS International Association Computer Investigative Specialists offer program
Asian School Cyber Laws offer international level certification Digital Evidence Analysis Digital Forensic Investigation
These Courses available online class room mode
Many commercial based forensic software company also offering proprietary certification product
For example Guidance Software offering EnCE certification tool EnCase AccessData offering ACE certification tool FTK PassMark Software offering OCE certification tool OSForensics Software Technology offering certification software Forensics

In book Scala I read code creates creates issue maintainability I ca see obvious definition word skew context
I aware problem I ca make fit word
Since used book I guessing real programming term circulation
Any pointer
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
Skew traditional definition mean alignment parallel
Obviously code copied pasted two copy identical parallel
This invariant
Changes made one copy guaranteed make copy due carelessness ignorance
Now two version code existing two different place skewed longer
This lead weird bug behavior seems work one place
Keep code DRY repeat
If urge copy paste likely abstract code copying shared superclass object oriented sort included utility function functional
Ever play game Telephone kid
You know one person whisper phrase next person line end last person say phrase loud everyone laugh different become original
That skew
When copy paste code inevitably make small change one copy
And often copy paste code change build code get skewed away original
I seen code hundred copy pasted block varying character nearly impossible maintain
If find wanting cut paste section code probably least consider putting function

The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software
formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation made representative ACM IEEE CS four area considers crucial discipline computer science
In addition four area CSAB also identifies field software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation important area computer science

Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

In context clock synchronization among node network
Are term synonymous difference
The term exactly although similarity
Clock Skew skew clock signal referred time gap expected arrival clock actual arrival skew positive negative
This might also called jitter may considered sort instability parameter system
Skew measured time unit
n u etc
When designing synchronous system must make sure system timing violation due clock skews
Clock Offset offset clock delay given clock source might known unknown
Offset measured time unit phase degree
Many time clock offset intentional instance common data synchronised falling edge clock case receiver data might consider clock offset degree
Another popular case might receiving data certain clock instance system also clock clock might low jitter rate offset usually unknown component compensate fix offset synchronise clock PLL
Hope clear

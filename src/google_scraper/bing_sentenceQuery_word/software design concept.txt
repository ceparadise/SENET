The developed century supplied designing circuit binary input value false true respectively terminology logic yield desired combination output
Theoretical work computability began provided needed extension design whole machine milestone specification theoretical device manipulates string British mathematician model computational power
Another breakthrough concept computer usually credited mathematician
This instruction well data stored fast access critical development modern computer
Previous thinking limited calculator approach instruction entered one time
The need user application provided main driving force early day computer science still great extent today
The difficulty writing program led first development allows programmer use instruction ADD symbol variable
Such program translated program known assembler binary encoding used computer
Other piece system software known linking loader combine piece assembled load machine main memory unit ready execution

The following provided overview topical guide computer science also called study theoretical foundation implementation application
One well known subject classification system devised
Computer science described following

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

A capture idea represents entity relationship
A conceptual model field special case general
To distinguish type model also known
Conceptual modeling confused modeling discipline physical modelling
The conceptual model explicitly chosen independent design implementation concern example concurrency data storage
The aim conceptual model express meaning term concept used domain expert discus problem find correct relationship different concept
The conceptual model attempt clarify meaning various usually ambiguous term ensure problem different interpretation term concept occur
Such differing interpretation could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholder especially responsible designing implementing solution conceptual model provides key artifact business understanding clarity
Once domain concept modeled model becomes basis subsequent development application domain
The concept conceptual model mapped physical design implementation construct using either manual
The realization conceptual model many domain combined coherent platform
A conceptual model described using various notation object modelling
In UML notation conceptual model often described represent concept represent relationship concept association represent role type taken instance modelled concept various situation
In ER notation conceptual model described ER Diagram entity represent concept represent relationship concept
Regardless notation used important compromise richness clarity business meaning depicted conceptual model expressing directly form influenced design implementation concern
This often used defining different process particular company institute

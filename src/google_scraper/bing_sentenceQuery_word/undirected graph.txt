Graphs mathematical concept found many us computer science
Graphs come many different flavor many found us computer program
Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part
Edge labeled graph usually drawn label drawn adjacent arc specifying edge
Here following part
Here following part
Here following part
Vertices like called sink
Vertices like called source
Here following part
Graphs often used represent physical entity network road relationship people etc inside computer
There numerous mechansims used

Possible operation include
Not program need operation program efficent representation compute operation needed others suffice
represented function
We could represent Dgraph follows In rest note assume Vertices type Vertices set finite range type
Thus graph represented follows There many many algorithm graph
In note look
They include

What graph computer science used
In layman term preferably
I read definition In computer science graph abstract data type meant implement graph hypergraph concept mathematics
A graph data structure consists finite possibly mutable set ordered pair called edge arc certain entity called node vertex
As mathematics edge x said point go x
The node may part graph structure may external entity represented integer index reference
I looking le formal easier understand definition
A perfect layman example might
The network friend friend etc collectively refered
In graph considered graph
In Facebook bidirectional relationship A B Friend B A friend graph
A network like Twitter would considered since direction relationship meaning
All graph refered graph relationship node form cycle
A hand special kind graph among thing since cycle family tree relatioship
It technically called since directed acyclic This cover basic jargon involving graph able follow rest material field
Graphs one important mathematical concept used computer science
You seen graph many time
Imagine taking plane flight one city another
You inevitably find nice glossy magazine airline seat pocket front
Near back magazine almost always find map depicts city serviced airline represented circle flight connect city represented curved line
That graph
The city represented circle node graph flight represented curved line edge
Graphs thing node edge connect node
You embellish simple graph various way
You want see bunch circle line looking map
Those city name
Labeling city result labeled graph
You also label edge flight
Computer science often associate data node sometimes edge extension label
It still labeled graph
Another embellishment result fly directly city A city B city B city A
An obvious way portray put arrow line connects city depict relationship
Now directed graph
Linked list tree state transition diagram lot computer science data structure example graph
It powerful concept
A better question would What graph used
Computer Science many respect study Graphs
A graph layman term collection arbitrary abstract object called node vertex represent point connection
They connected via path edge
The abstract data type Graph implementation mathematical Graph
So basically node edge field various operation perform
You instance add new node graph collection could list array structure depending language
You could link node existing node
Operations would also include traversing graph checking whether two node share edge connected retrieving value node edge deletion node edge graph
As far utilization go Graphs used place
Networking make particularly heavy use found Artificial Intelligence Data Mining Game Development Geoinformatics host discipline
In formal Computer Science see even use namely way representing state
Effectively anything represent set connection represented graph implemented via ADT form
Here example graphic I made A graph collection object connected together line called vertex
The term graph abstraction generalization many data structure used software development
Linked list binary tree graph
Basically collection object pointer associate object graph
Once graph apply principle

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I unweighted undirected graph every node connected average two hundred node node people social network
What fastest algorithm find shortest path one node another
Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
assuming distance target good solution valid BFS search simultaneously source target BFS depth depth
The algorithm end find vertex v BFS front
The vertex v terminates algorithm run exactly middle source target
This algorithm yield much better result case BFS source explanation better BFS follows surely provide answer one exist
assume distance source target branch factor every vertex B edge
BFS open vertex
BFS open vertex
large B k second obviously much better first
NOTE solution NOT require storing whole graph memory requires implementing function return successor vertex vertex get within step v
With node open explained stored
To save memory use one direction instead BFS consume time
In case difference BFS BFS assuming developing node
As see BFS need much le node developed alternative

I came across issue definition directed graph Sipser Introduction theory computation Ed
On An simply set point line connecting point
The point called node vertex line called edge On page
On If arrow instead line graph
In Figure example directed graph arrow node node arrow node node
So two arrow opposite direction two node
I understand basic
My question Is directed graph graph
As often case using formal definition helpful Let V finite set
V E Note central difference edge set graph pair digraph
In particular simpleness implied definition
Extending definition also easy E multiset could graph
If edge two component hypergraphs
People define di graph different way one common variant
For example uncomfortable digraph formally graph define like Let V finite set E
We call pair V E
We say This defines undirected graph special case directed graph
Note definition extension graph edge get marking may awkward We want complete digraph different complete undirected graph former two labeled edge every pair node latter one definition
Note first definition I gave circumvents issue nicely sometimes definition made later need mind
The word two meaning shorthand graph like book defines refer something directed undirected graph
The first meaning common
Directed graph undirected graph thing arrow versus line although one view undirected graph directed graph replace every undirected edge two arrow one either direction A B becomes A B
Additionally problem transform directed graph undirected graph problem solution
The proof Hamiltonian cycle problem undirected graph usually done reduction directed version transforming directed graph undirected graph Hamiltonian cycle original graph one

In study mathematical structure used model pairwise relation object
A graph context made connected
A graph may meaning distinction two vertex associated edge edge may one vertex another see detailed definition variation type graph commonly considered
Graphs one prime object study
Refer basic definition graph theory
Definitions graph theory vary
The following basic way defining graph related mathematical structure
In common sense term comprising together set subset
edge associated two vertex association take form comprising two vertex
To avoid ambiguity type graph may described precisely
Other sens stem different conception edge set
In one generalized notion set together relation associate edge two vertex
In another generalized notion unordered pair necessarily distinct vertex
Many author call type object pseudograph
All variant others described fully
The vertex belonging edge called edge
A vertex may exist graph belong edge
usually taken finite many result true rather different infinite graph many argument fail
The graph number vertex
The graph number edge
The vertex number edge connect edge connects vertex counted twice
For edge graph theorist usually use somewhat shorter notation
Graphs used model many type relation process physical biological social information system
Many practical problem represented graph
Emphasizing application system term sometimes defined mean graph attribute
name associated node edge
In graph used represent network communication data organization computational device flow computation etc
For instance link structure represented directed graph vertex represent web page directed edge represent one page another
A similar approach taken problem social medium travel biology computer chip design mapping progression disease many field
The development handle graph therefore major interest computer science
The often formalized represented
Complementary system focusing manipulation graph geared towards storing querying
method various form proven particularly useful since natural language often lends well discrete structure
Traditionally compositional semantics follow structure whose expressive power lie modeled hierarchical graph
More contemporary approach model syntax natural language using
Within especially applied computer modeling word meaning easier given word understood term related word therefore important
Still method phonology
us morphology
morphology using common analysis language graph
Indeed usefulness area mathematics linguistics borne organization well various project others
Graph theory also used study molecule
In structure complicated simulated atomic structure studied quantitatively gathering statistic property related topology atom
In chemistry graph make natural model molecule vertex represent edge
This approach especially used computer processing molecular structure ranging database searching
In graph represent local connection interacting part system well dynamic physical process system
Similarly graph used represent functional connection brain area interact give rise various cognitive process vertex represent different area brain edge represent connection area
Graph theory play important role electrical modeling electrical network weight associated resistance wire segment obtain electrical property network structure
Graphs also used represent channel vertex represent pore edge represent smaller channel connecting pore
Graph theory also widely used way example explore notably use software
Under umbrella social network many different type graph
Acquaintanceship friendship graph describe whether people know
Influence graph model whether certain people influence behavior others
Finally collaboration graph model whether two people work together particular way acting movie together
Likewise graph theory useful conservation effort vertex represent region certain specie exist inhabit edge represent migration path movement region
This information important looking breeding pattern tracking spread disease parasite change movement affect specie
In mathematics graph useful geometry certain part topology
close link
A graph structure extended assigning weight edge graph
Graphs weight used represent structure pairwise connection numerical value
For example graph represents road network weight could represent length road
There may several weight associated edge including distance previous example travel time monetary cost
Such weighted graph commonly used program GPS search engine compare flight time cost
The paper written published regarded first paper history graph theory
This paper well one written carried initiated
Euler formula relating number edge vertex face convex polyhedron studied generalized represents beginning branch mathematics known
More one century Euler paper bridge introducing concept topology led interest particular analytical form arising study particular class graph
This study many implication theoretical
The technique used mainly concern particular property
Enumerative graph theory arose result Cayley fundamental result published
These generalized
Cayley linked result tree contemporary study chemical composition
The fusion idea mathematics chemistry began become part standard terminology graph theory
In particular term graph introduced paper published draw analogy quantic invariant algebra molecular diagram The first textbook graph theory written published
Another book published considered world definitive textbook subject enabled mathematician chemist electrical engineer social scientist talk
Harary donated royalty fund
One famous stimulating problem graph theory Is true map drawn plane may region colored four color way two region common border different color
This problem first posed first written record letter addressed year
Many incorrect proof proposed including Cayley others
The study generalization problem led study coloring graph embedded surface arbitrary
Tait reformulation generated new class problem particularly studied
The work Ramsey coloration specially result obtained origin another branch graph theory
The four color problem remained unsolved century
In published method solving problem using computer
A proof produced make fundamental use notion discharging developed Heesch
The proof involved checking property configuration computer fully accepted time due complexity
A simpler proof considering configuration given twenty year later
The autonomous development topology fertilized graph theory back work
Another important factor common development graph theory came use technique modern algebra
The first example use come work physicist published calculating
The introduction probabilistic method graph theory especially study asymptotic probability graph connectivity gave rise yet another branch known fruitful source result
Graphs represented visually drawing dot circle every vertex drawing arc two vertex connected edge
If graph directed direction indicated drawing arrow
A graph drawing confused graph abstract structure several way structure graph drawing
All matter vertex connected others many edge exact layout
In practice often difficult decide two drawing represent graph
Depending problem domain layout may better suited easier understand others
The pioneering work influential subject graph drawing
Among achievement introduced use linear algebraic method obtain graph drawing
Graph drawing also said encompass problem deal various generalization
The crossing number graph minimum number intersection edge drawing graph plane must contain
For planar graph crossing number zero definition
Drawings surface plane also studied
There different way store graph computer system
The used depends graph structure used manipulating graph
Theoretically one distinguish list matrix structure concrete application best structure often combination
List structure often preferred smaller memory requirement
structure hand provide faster access application consume huge amount memory
List structure include array pair vertex separately list neighbor vertex Much like incidence list vertex list vertex adjacent
Matrix structure include matrix whose row represent vertex whose column represent edge row column indexed vertex
In case indicates two adjacent object indicates two object
The modified form adjacency matrix incorporates information vertex useful calculation number graph
The like adjacency matrix row column indexed vertex rather containing cell contains length two vertex
There large literature problem counting graph meeting specified condition
Some work found Harary Palmer
A common problem called finding fixed graph given graph
One reason interested question many subgraphs mean graph property subgraphs
Unfortunately finding maximal subgraphs certain kind often
For example A similar problem finding given graph
Again important graph property hereditary respect induced subgraphs mean graph property induced subgraphs also
Finding maximal induced subgraphs certain kind also often
For example Still another problem minor containment problem find fixed graph minor given graph
A subcontraction graph graph obtained taking subgraph contracting edge
Many graph property hereditary minor mean graph property minor
For example state A similar problem subdivision containment problem find fixed graph given graph
A graph graph obtained subdividing edge
Subdivision containment related graph property
For example state Another problem subdivision containment Another class problem extent various specie generalization graph determined
For example Many problem theorem graph theory various way coloring graph
Typically one interested coloring graph two adjacent vertex color similar restriction
One may also consider coloring edge possibly two coincident edge color variation
Among famous result conjecture concerning graph coloring following Constraint modeling theory concern family directed graph related
In application graph ordered specificity meaning constrained specific thus contain greater amount subsumed general
Operations graph include evaluating direction subsumption relationship two graph computing graph unification
The unification two argument graph defined general graph computation thereof consistent
contains information input graph exists efficient unification algorithm known
For constraint framework strictly graph unification sufficient satisfiability combination function
application include modeling
There numerous problem arising especially application various notion example graph specific instance problem tend closely related
Decomposition defined partitioning edge set graph many vertex necessary accompanying edge part partition wide variety question
Often required decompose graph subgraphs isomorphic fixed graph instance decomposing complete graph Hamiltonian cycle
Other problem specify family graph given graph decomposed instance family cycle decomposing complete graph specified tree respectively edge
Some specific decomposition problem studied include Many problem involve characterizing member various class graph
Some example question

I undirected graph V E node labelled n specific node k I two representation graph How would I go figuring node k adjacent node graph
This part bigger problem I
I want concrete pseudocode solution plain English I would scan data structure I would determine
Please keep complexity low possible Thanks You could probably check every node return false adjacent I think avoid checking every vertex fail would good idea

In set stored storage location denoted word copy value variable
In assignment statement expression fundamental construct
Today commonly used notation basic operation come originally Superplan popularized followed originally popularised although many notation use
In language symbol used regarded meaning assignment value others define assignment statement meaning used expression
Assignments typically allow variable hold different value different time
However language primarily allow kind destructive reassignment might imply change state
The purpose enforce
function depend state variable produce result given set parametric input point time
Modern program language also often use similar strategy although le strict certain part order reduce complexity normally conjunction complementing methodology
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed purely functional language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent reassignment allowed
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available purely functional language variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include data structure var accepts multiple assignment value equal contrast Haskell dataflow variable cell data structure like list symbol vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate represented
This type one possible value therefore containing information
It typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
Certain use pattern common thus often special syntax support
These primarily reduce redundancy source code also simplify compilation clarifying programmer intent easing analysis source code
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant provide special operator called like instead written
Beyond syntactic sugar simplifies compilation since make clear modification variable possible
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
Chained assignment equivalent sequence assignment evaluation strategy differs language
For simple chained assignment like initializing multiple variable evaluation strategy matter target assignment connected way evaluation strategy affect result
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment expression value
In case chain assignment implemented assignment happen
For example equivalent
In also available value class type declaring appropriate return type assignment operator
In assignment statement expression thus value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
This essentially equivalent though actual variable produced temporary value
Some programming language since allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
This often known introduced name sometimes called though confusing used single assignment opposite
If side assignment single variable
array structure feature called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly swap value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Some language Go Python combine parallel assignment tuples automatic allow multiple return value single function Python example This provides alternative use returning multiple value function
This date CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally
In C similar parallel assignment allowing multiple assignment occur within single statement writing instead
This primarily used replaced parallel assignment language Go
However code ensure perfect simultaneity since right side following code evaluated left side
In language Python assign two variable concurrently using initial value compute new b
The use equal sign assignment operator frequently criticized due conflict equal comparison equality
This result confusion novice writing code confusion even experienced programmer reading code
The use equal assignment date back language designed particularly popularized Fortran A notorious example bad idea choice equal sign denote assignment
It go back Fortran blindly copied army language designer
Why bad idea
Because overthrow century old tradition let denote comparison equality predicate either true false
But Fortran made mean assignment enforcing equality
In case operand unequal footing The left operand variable made equal right operand expression
x mean thing x
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C including one famous attempt backdoor Linux kernel assignment operator also return value assigned way function return value validly nested inside expression
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
The two common representation copying assignment
Both form may semantically denote either assignment assignment also value depending language usage
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Mathematical assignment generally depicted
Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix postfix syntax statement including assignment

A computer operator person responsible monitoring controlling computer system especially computer system company organization
Responsibilities include troubleshooting software hardware problem monitoring processing maintaining improving system performance online availability maintaining system documentation assisting personnel computer problem
Other responsibility depend employer might include system backup maintaining computer room equipment including printer tape storage device providing customer support
A computer operator may often asked know learn main computer operating system IBM Job Entry Subsystem local area network operation application used employer
A high school diploma usually required
Most employer also require formal technical training one three year experience
A computer operator must effectively interact communicate others able work independently strong analytical skill able recognize respond problem situation

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What difference three especially context User manual User guide User instruction There considerable overlap among three extent interchangeable
They coupled together term
In addition number similar term like
refers specifically reference document provides detailed information operation maintenance product
Manufacturers often provide official manual product provide assistance owner user car example usually come machinery official documentation Unix program
generic term
Whereas implies written document one could booklet video game large book complex product car guide card another medium altogether video
It may detailed reference also indicate simple overview instruction small subset feature
Because manual connotation dense boring text manufacturer technical writer prefer label guide would traditionally called manual
generic term may synonymous guidance perform specific task function
A manual guide include many set instruction
Used alone however instruction refer simplest explanatory
The presence phrase cited suggests electronic software product case I would say three phrase cited synonymous
For example Apple label website Manuals yet document themeselves
I think would rare supplied three different reference labeled user manual user guide user instruction
In case I would expect manual main canonical reference guide short overview feature instruction rudimentary introduction use product question
Agreeing Choster I believe official comprehensive reference operation maintenance product device
Manuals may also provide conceptual information design theory
Some manual comprehensive enough include information would otherwise found separate guide instruction usage scenario diagnostic procedure installation instruction etc
A coach user use product effectively efficiently typically providing application example usage scenario
Some marketing professional prefer using term guide instead manual without regard distinction guide sound helpful easier read
simply procedure presumably procedure accomplishing specific task
The instruction contained manual guide standalone document instruction sheet assembling furniture replacing battery
Agreeing chessmath choster I like add cent
may refer subject matter
Project Team Test System Administrative Marketing Miscellaneous type
For every subject matter certain instruction using
user guide reference manual need created packaging along certain product service
IMHO two type documentation From onwards start building expanding certain documentation requirement specific required law product service
Manual related operate something usually electronic device
The word come Latin manus hand context mean operate something hand
User guide give u idea introducing device giving aspect capacity tour know delightful task device
User instruction related give instruction given task follow strictly instruction performance well activity
Manual focus Object device How operate
Guide focus capacity device
Instruction focus leading determined task device

An operator programming language symbol tell compiler interpreter perform specific mathematical relational logical operation produce final result
This chapter explain concept take important arithmetic relational operator available C Java Python
Computer program widely used mathematical calculation
We write computer program simple calculation like adding two number also write program solve complex equation like P x x
If even poor student must aware first expression operand operator
Similar concept exist Computer Programming
Take look following two example These two statement called arithmetic expression programming language used expression called arithmetic operator value used expression like x called operand
In simplest form expression produce numerical result
Similarly programming language provides various arithmetic operator
The following table list important arithmetic operator available C programming language
Assume variable A hold variable B hold Following simple example C Programming understand mathematical operator When program executed produce following result Consider situation create two variable assign value follows Here obvious variable A greater B value
So need help symbol write expression called relational expression
If use C programming language written follows Here used symbol called relational operator simplest form produce Boolean result mean result either true false
Similarly programming language provides various relational operator
The following table list important relational operator available C programming language
Assume variable hold variable hold Here show one example C Programming make use
Though statement discussed later separate chapter short use check condition condition true body executed otherwise body skipped
When program executed produce following result Logical operator important programming language help u take decision based certain condition
Suppose want combine result two condition logical AND OR logical operator help u producing final result
The following table show logical operator supported C language
Assume variable hold variable hold Try following example understand logical operator available C programming language When compile execute program produce following result Following equivalent program written Java

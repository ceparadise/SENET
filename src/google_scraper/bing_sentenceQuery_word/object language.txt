In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

use predefined programming modular unit object class subclass forth order make programming faster easier maintain
language help manage complexity large program
Objects package data operation operation publicly accessible internal detail data structure hidden
This information hiding made programming easier allowing programmer think part program isolation
In addition object may derived general one inheriting capability
Such object made possible define specialized object without repeating general one
programming began Simula language added information hiding
Another influential language Smalltalk program set object interacted sending message one another
Since one successful language

Programming language language programmer writes instruction computer ultimately execute
The earliest programming language far removed instruction directly executed hardware
Users soon beginning invented convenient language
The early language FORTRAN Formula Translator originally much like assembly language however allowed programmer write algebraic expression instead coded instruction operation
As learning program computer became increasingly important stripped basic version FORTRAN called Beginner Symbolic Instruction Code written John Kemeny Thomas Kurtz Hanover teach novice simple programming skill
BASIC quickly spread academic institution beginning version BASIC personal computer allowed even student elementary school learn fundamental programming
At roughly time FORTRAN created COBOL Common Language developed handle record file operation necessary simple business application
The trend since toward developing increasingly abstract language allowing programmer think communicate machine level ever remote
COBOL FORTRAN descendant Pascal C known imperative language since specify sequence explicit command machine go solving problem hand different take place machine level
Other language sense programming done calling invoking function procedure section executed within program
The language type List Processing computation expressed application one Since LISP object may function well individual data item variable mathematical terminology data structure see section programmer create function appropriate level abstraction solve problem hand
This feature made LISP popular language application although somewhat superseded Programming Logic
These termed declarative language sense programmer specifies goal accomplished specific method applied attain goal
Prolog based concept resolution akin logical deduction unification similar pattern matching
Programs language written sequence goal
A recent extension logic programming constraint logic programming pattern matching replaced general operation constraint satisfaction
Again program sequence goal attained case satisfaction specified constraint
An important trend programming language support data encapsulation code
Data encapsulation best illustrated language programming done term object
An object Smalltalk similar language consists data together procedure program segment operate data
Encapsulation refers fact object data accessed method procedure provided
Programming done creating object send message one another task accomplished cooperatively others method
This influential
For example language C popular application system development largely supplanted extension
An version BASIC named available personal computer allows even novice programmer create interactive application elegant GUIs
In introduced yet another language
Applications written Java translated particular machine language intermediate language called Java Bytecode may executed computer using UNIX Macintosh Windows operating system Java interpretation program known Java virtual machine
See
Thus Java ideal creating distributed application application
The application reside server Bytecode form readily downloaded executed Java virtual machine
In many case desirable download entire application interface client may communicate interactively application
Java applet small chunk application code solve problem
Residing server may downloaded run standard provide example client interface game residing server
Concurrency refers execution one procedure time perhaps access shared data either truly simultaneously multiprocessor unpredictably interleaved manner
Languages standard application language include encapsulation feature allow programmer specify rule interaction procedure task
At still higher level abstraction lie visual programming language programmer graphically express want done mean icon represent data object process arrow represent data flow sequencing operation
As yet none visual programming language found wide commercial acceptance
On hand language much successful example language like sophisticated may easily expressed fourth generation language allow user express request data simple command
For example query Select salary payroll employee Jones written database language SQL easily understood reader
The language HyperText Markup Language allows nonprogrammers design Web page specifying structure content leaf detailed presentation extraction information client Web browser
Computer program written language machine language must either interpreted compiled
An software examines one instruction time call code execute operation required instruction
This rather slow process
A software translates computer program whole machine code saved subsequent execution whenever desired
Much work done making process compiled code efficient possible
When new language developed usually first interpreted
If language becomes popular becomes important write compiler although may task considerable difficulty
There intermediate approach compile code machine language intermediate language close enough machine language efficient close tied machine language particular computer
It use approach provides Java language independence
field computer science
From logical vantage point instructive observation offered Dutch Evert Beth independently slightly different form Finnish philosopher Jaakko Hintikka
Both pointed certain proof method Beth called Curry others computer science become branch mathematics
Thus theoretical computer science object study theorem also proof well calculation program algorithm
Theoretical computer science turn close connection investigation idealized computer ramification theory finite automaton mathematical linguistics
philosophy computer science artificial intelligence AI neuroscience neurology anthropology
The term used cognitive scientist refers many kind thinking including involved perception branch engineering concerned practical application electricity form including field electronics
Electronics engineering branch electrical engineering concerned us electromagnetic spectrum application electronic device We welcome suggested improvement article

There hundred programming language use today
How know one learn first
How know one best IT field choice
Well I ca answer question
But start learning one top popular one
That way always able get job IT industry
Learning programming language easy rewarding
You lot question first
Just remember get help need
You find answer almost everything Google nowadays excuse failure
Also remember take year become expert programmer
Do expect get good overnight
Just keep learning something new every day eventually competent enough get job done This article cover top popular programming language ranked June
I added general review comment language listed
Remember personal opinion
Other IT professional might different opinion
us released Sun Microsystems
Java number one programming language today many reason
First language strong library reusable software component
Second program written Java run many different computer architecture operating system use JVM Java
Sometimes referred code even WORA write run anywhere
Third Java language likely taught university computer science class
A lot computer science theory book written past decade use Java code example
So learning Java good idea even never actually code
Java Strengths WORA popularity Java Weaknesses Slower natively compiled language compiled developed use UNIX operating system
Although designed portable nature C program must specifically compiled computer different architecture operating system
This help make lightning fast
Although C relatively old language still widely used system programming writing programming language embedded system
Strengths Speed Weaknesses Memory management difficult master compiled written update C Bjarne Stroustrup
It attempt C brings help larger project
Despite age used create wide array application game office suite
Strengths Speed Weaknesses older considered clumsy newer language Java C
us language originally developed create dynamic web page
At first even real programming language time eventually grew fully featured programming language
Although PHP much criticized past bit sloppy insecure pretty good since version came
It hard argue success
Today PHP popular language used write web application
Even English IT program currently using written PHP Strengths Web programming good documentation Weaknesses Inconsistent many way thing history bizarre security decision interpreted language developed Microsoft Corporation Windows platform
It evolving year seen direct descendant Microsoft old BASIC
Visual Basic good language scripting Windows application need power speed C
Strengths None
Weaknesses Only run Windows interpreted programming language written late intended general programming purpose
Python named snake actually Monty Python comedy group
Python characterized use indentation readability encouragement making developer similar thing similar way
Python used main programming choice Google Ubuntu
Strengths Excellent readability overall philosophy Weaknesses None compiled language written Microsoft
It open specification rarely seen platform
C conceived Microsoft premium language
It similar Java syntax nature
Strengths Powerful pretty fast Weaknesses Only really suitable Windows interpreted language
A strange one
Despite name nothing whatsoever Java
You rarely ever see language outside web browser
It basically language meant script behavior web browser used thing web form validation AJAX style web application
The trend future seems building complex application JavaScript even simple online game office suite
The success trend depend upon advancement speed browser JavaScript interpreter
If want correct real name programming language although almost nobody actually call
Strengths reliable way web programming Weaknesses really useful web browser interpreted language written
It characterized somewhat disorganized syntax make sense PERL programmer However lot veteran programmer love use every day primary language
year ago Perl popular today
What happened
A lot newer programmer even old Perl programmer switched language PHP Python Ruby
Perl perhaps still best language text processing system administration scripting
I personally recommend however primary programming language
Strengths text processing system administration Weaknesses strange syntax perhaps many way thing interpreted language written around
It one language world
Everything object Ruby even letter number method call
It great language learn love object
The negative love make bit slow even interpreted language
Strengths Perhaps world language Weaknesses superior object model come price namely speed Okay
Those top programming language use today personal comment
Remember opinion like nose everyone one smell If disagree please feel free email write opinion forum
Which programming language already know
Which one want learn
Why
Which language think best making banking software
Web page
Games
Text processing
Computer language FORTRAN COBOL popular much anymore
Why think lost popularity
Which language top think drop year
Which one gain popularity
I teach English young software developer
We use site regular basis
It useful

In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

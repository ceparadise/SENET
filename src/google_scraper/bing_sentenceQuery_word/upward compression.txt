Images either vector bitmap
Bitmap image made small part called pixel
Vector image made using coordinate geometry
Images compressed reduce file size
used reduce file size change various attribute image file
These attribute include You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation lossy lossless compression Compression
Lossless compression mean file size compressed picture quality remains get worse
Also file decompressed original quality
Lossy compression permanently remove data
There number type compressed image file
These include following
compression type
It often used graphic might changed another person image contains layer graphic need kept separate
It
often used digital camera image fairly small file size quality display
JPEG format offer higher compression rate PNG quality
compress image maximum making
GIF often used transparency needed graphic
GIF also used store simple animated image

Data compression reduces amount space needed store file
If halve size file store twice many file cost download file twice fast half cost paying download
Even though disk getting bigger high bandwidth becoming common nice get even value working smaller compressed file
For large data warehouse like kept Google Facebook halving amount space taken represent massive reduction space computing required consequently big saving power consumption cooling huge reduction impact environment
Common form compression currently use include JPEG used photo used audio MPEG used video including DVDs ZIP many kind data
For example JPEG method reduces photo tenth smaller original size mean camera store time many photo image web downloaded time faster
So catch
Well issue quality data example highly compressed JPEG image look sharp image compressed
Also take processing time compress decompress data
In case tradeoff worth always
Kb JPEG Kb JPEG Use interactive online In chapter look compression might done benefit cost associated using compressed data need considered deciding whether compress data
We start simple example Run Length Encoding give insight benefit issue around compression
Watch video online Run length encoding RLE technique widely used day great way get feel issue around using compression
Imagine following simple black white image
One simple way computer store image binary using format mean white mean black bit map mapped pixel onto value bit
Using method image would represented following way There image format us simple representation described
The format called portable bitmap format PBM
PBM file saved file extension contain simple header followed image data
The data file viewed opening text editor much like opening file image viewed opening drawing image viewing program support PBM file format well supported number image viewing editing program display
A pbm file diamond image used earlier would follows The first two line header
The first line specifies format file mean file contains ASCII zero one
The second line specifies width height image pixel
This allows computer know size dimension image even newline character separating row file missing
The rest data image like
If wanted could copy paste representation including header text file save file extension
If program computer able open PBM file could view image
You could even write program output file display image
Because digit represented using ASCII format efficient useful want read inside file
There variation format pack pixel bit instead character variation used grey scale colour image
More
The key question compression whether represent image using fewer bit still able reconstruct original image
It turn
There many way going section focussing method called
Imagine read bit someone copying might say thing like five zero instead zero zero zero zero zero
Is basic idea behind run length encoding RLE used save space storing digital image
In run length encoding replace row number say many consecutive pixel colour
For example first row image contains one white two black four white one black four white two black one white pixel
This could represented follows
For second row need say number white pixel say number black need explicitly say zero start row
You might ask need say number white pixel first case zero
The reason clear rule start computer would way knowing colour display image represented form
The third row contains five white five black five white
This coded That mean get following representation first three row
You work row would following system
The remaining row In video Computer Science Unplugged show Run length encoded image decoded using large pixel printer spray
Watch video online Just ensure reverse compression process go finding original representation zero one compressed image
What image
How many pixel original image
How many number used represent pixel
This image solution available activity cup saucer
The following interactive allows experiment Run Length Encoding
Use interactive online How much space saved using alternate representation measure
One simple way consider imagine typing representation could think original bit stored one character RLE code using character digit comma bit crude starting point
In original representation digit one zero required represent image
Count number comma digit space newlines ignore new representation
This number character required represent image new representation ensure right track first row given contain character
Assuming got new image representation correct counted correctly found character new image double check number differs
This mean new representation requires around many character represent calculated using
This significant reduction amount space required store image half size
The new representation form old one
In practice method extra trick used compress image original size
In real system original image us one bit every pixel store black white value one character used calculation
However run length number also stored much efficiently using bit pattern take little space represent number
The bit pattern used usually based technique called Huffman coding beyond want get
The main place black white scanned image used fax machine use approach compression
One reason work well scanned page number consecutive white pixel huge
In fact entire scanned line nothing white pixel
A typical fax page pixel across replacing bit one number big saving
The number take bit represent place scanned page consecutive pixel replaced number overall saving significant
In fact fax machine would take time longer send page use compression
Now know run length encoding work come compress black white image well uncompress image somebody else given
Start making picture one zero
Make sure rectangular row length
You either draw paper prepare computer using fixed width font otherwise become really frustrating confusing
In order make easier could start working want image grid paper math exercise book shading square represent black one leaving blank represent white one
Once done could write zero one image
Work compressed representation image using run length coding
run length separated comma form explained
Now give copy run length code original uncompressed representation friend classmate along explanation compressed
Ask try draw image grid paper
Once done check conversion original
Imagining friend computer shown image using system representation compressed one computer decompressed another long standard agreed
every line begin white pixel
It important compression algorithm follow standard file compressed one computer decompressed another example song often follow standard downloaded played variety device
As compressed representation image converted back original representation original representation compressed representation would give image read computer compression algorithm called
none data lost compressing image result compression could undone exactly
Not compression algorithm lossless though
In type file particular photo sound video willing sacrifice little bit quality
lose little data representing image allows u make file size lot smaller
For downloading large file movie essential ensure file size big infeasible download
These compression method called
If data lost impossible convert file back exactly original form lossy compression used person viewing movie listening music may mind lower quality file smaller
Later chapter investigate effect lossy compression algorithm image sound
Interestingly turn compression algorithm case compressed version file larger uncompressed version
Computer scientist even proven case meaning impossible anybody ever come lossless compression algorithm make possible file smaller
In case issue though good lossless compression algorithm tend give best compression common pattern data worst compression one highly unlikely occur
What image best compression
image size small percentage original come
This best case performance compression algorithm
What worst compression
Can find image actually compressed representation
Don forget comma version used
This worst case performance compression algorithm
The best case image entirely white one number used per line
The worst case every pixel alternating black white one number every pixel
In fact case size compressed file likely little larger original one number likely take one bit store
Real system represent data exactly discussed issue
In worst case alternating black white pixel run length encoding method result file larger original
As noted lossless compression method make least one file smaller must also file make larger mathematically possible method always make file smaller unless method lossy
As trivial example suppose someone claim compression method convert file file
How many different file
There
How many different file
There
Can see problem
We got possible file might want compress way represent
So identical representation ca decoded exactly
Over year several fraud based claim lossless compression method compress every file given
This true method lossy loses information lossless method must expand file
It would nice file could compressed without loss could compress huge file apply compression compressed file make smaller repeating one byte one bit
Unfortunately possible
Images take lot space time picture stored computer compressed avoid wasting much space
With lot image especially photograph need store image exactly originally contains way detail anyone see
This lead considerable saving space especially detail missing kind people trouble perceiving
This kind compression called lossy compression
There situation image need stored exactly original medical scan high quality photograph processing case lossless method used image compressed
using RAW format camera
In data representation section looked size image file reduced using fewer bit describe colour pixel
However image compression method JPEG take advantage pattern image reduce space needed represent without impacting image unnecessarily
The following three image show difference reducing bit depth using specialised image compression system
The left hand image original bit per pixel
The middle image compressed one third original size using JPEG lossy version original difference unlikely perceptible
The right hand one number colour reduced bit per pixel instead mean also stored third original size
Even though lost many bit information removed much impact look
This advantage JPEG remove information image much impact perceived quality
Furthermore JPEG choose tradeoff quality file size
Reducing number bit colour depth sufficiently crude really regard compression method low quality representation
Image compression method like JPEG GIF PNG designed take advantage pattern image get good reduction file size without losing quality necessary
For example following image show zoomed view pixel part detail around eye high quality image
Notice colour adjacent pixel often similar even part picture lot detail
For example pixel shown red box change gradually dark light
encoding would work situation
You could use variation specifies pixel colour say many following pixel colour although adjacent pixel nearly chance identical low would almost run identical colour
But way take advantage gradually changing colour
For pixel red box could generate approximate version colour specifying first last one getting computer calculate one assuming colour change gradually
Instead storing pixel value needed yet someone viewing probably might notice difference
This would ca reproduce original exactly would good enough lot purpose save lot space
The process guessing colour pixel two known example
A interpolation assumes value increase constant rate two given value example five pixel suppose first pixel blue colour value last one blue value linear interpolation would guess blue value one would save storing
In practice complex approach used guess pixel linear interpolation give idea going
The JPEG system widely used photo us sophisticated version idea
Instead taking run pixel work block pixel
And instead estimating value linear function us combination cosine wave
A cosine wave form trig function often used calculating side triangle
If plot cosine value degree get smooth curve going
Variations plot used approximate value pixel going one colour another
If add higher frequency cosine wave produce interesting shape
In theory pattern pixel created adding together different cosine wave
The following graph show value ranging degree
JPEGs based idea add together lot sine cosine wave create waveform want
Converting waveform block pixel sample music sum simple wave done using technique called widely used idea signal processing
You experiment adding sine wave together generate shape using
In spreadsheet yellow region first sheet allows choose sine wave add
Try setting sine wave frequency time fundamental frequency respectively fundamental lowest frequency
Now set amplitude equivalent volume level four respectively half previous one
This produce following four sine wave When four wave added together interfere produce shape sharper transition In fact continue pattern four sine wave shape would become square wave one suddenly go maximum value suddenly minimum
The one shown bumpy used sine wave describe
This exactly going JPEG compress black white image
The colour pixel go across image either black full intensity white JPEG approximate small number cosine wave basically property sine wave
This give overshoot see image JPEG image come bright dark patch surrounding sudden change colour like You experiment different combination sine wave get different shape
You may need four get good approximation shape want exactly tradeoff JPEG making
There suggestion parameter second sheet spreadsheet
Each block pixel JPEG image created adding together different amount pattern based cosine wave
The wave represented visually pattern white black pixel shown image
These particular wave known basis function block pixel created combining
The basis function top left average colour block
By adding increasing coefficient multiplied resultant block become darker
The basis function become complex towards bottom right therefore used le commonly
How often would image every pixel different color bottom right basis function
To investigate basis function combined form pattern block pixel try puzzle
Use interactive online So pixel block represented coefficient tell u much basis function use
But help u save space compress image
At moment still storing exactly amount data different way
The name JPEG short Joint Photographic Experts Group committee formed create standard digital photograph could captured displayed different brand device
Because file extension limited three character often seen extension
The cosine wave used JPEG image based Discrete Cosine Transform
The Discrete mean waveform digital opposite continuous value occur
In JPEG wave x value block coded value limited range number binary integer rather value
The advantage using DCT representation allows u separate low frequency change top left one high frequency change bottom right JPEG compression us advantage
The human eye usually notice high frequency change image often discarded without affecting visual quality image
The low frequency le varied basis function far important image
JPEG compression us process called quantisation set insignificant basis function coefficient zero
But decide insignificant
Quantisation requires quantisation table number
Each coefficient value divided corresponding value quantisation table rounded nearest integer
This mean many coefficient become zero multiplied back quantisation table remain zero
There optimal quantisation table every image many camera image processing company worked develop good quantisation table
As result many kept secret
Some company also developed software analyse image select appropriate quantisation table particular image
For example image text high frequency detail important quantisation table lower value bottom right detail kept
Of course also result image size remaining relatively large
Lossy compression compromise
The figure show image quantisation applied
Before Quantisation After Quantisation Notice image look similar even though second one many zero coefficient
The difference see barely visible image viewed original size
Try Use interactive online We still number even many zero save space storing zero
You notice zero bunched towards bottom right
This mean list coefficient starting top left corner end many zero row
Instead writing zero store fact zero using method encoding similar one discussed earlier chapter
And finally number left converted bit using Huffman coding common value take le space vice versa
All thing happen every time take photo save JPEG file happens every block pixel
When display image software need reverse process adding basis function together block hundereds thousand block image
An important issue arises JPEG represents image smoothly varying colour happens colour change suddenly
In case lot value need stored lot cosine wave added together make sudden change colour else edge image become fuzzy
You think cosine wave overshooting sudden change producing artifact like one following image edge messy
The original sharp edge zoomed view JPEG version show edge gradual darker pixel occur white space looking bit like shadow echo
For reason JPEG used photo natural image technique GIF PNG look another section work better artificial image like one
General purpose compression method need lossless ca assume user wo mind data changed
The widely used general purpose compression algorithm ZIP gzip rar based method called coding invented Jacob Ziv Abraham Lempel
We look text file example
The main idea coding sequence character often repeated file example sequence character image appears often chapter instead storing repeated occurrence replace reference last occurred
As long reference smaller phrase replaced save space
Typically system based approach used reduce text file little quarter original size almost good method known compressing text
The following interactive allows explore idea
The empty box replaced reference text occurring earlier
You click box see reference type referenced character decode text
What happens reference pointing another reference
As long decode first last information available need
View link online You also enter text clicking Text tab
You could paste text see many character replaced reference
The reference actually two number first say many character count back previous phrase start second say long referenced phrase
Each reference typically take space one two character system make saving long two character replaced
The option interactive allow require replaced length least two avoid replacing single character reference
Of course character count letter alphabet system also refer back white space word
In fact common sequence thing like full stop followed space
This approach also work well black white image since sequence like white pixel likely occurred
Here bit example earlier chapter paste interactive see many pointer needed represent
In fact essentially happens GIF PNG image pixel value compressed using algorithm work well lot consecutive pixel colour
But work poorly photograph pixel pattern unlikely repeated
The method described named compression Jacob Ziv Abraham Lempel two computer scientist invented
Unfortunately someone mixed order name wrote article called LZ compression instead ZL compression
So many people copied mistake Ziv Lempel method usually called LZ compression
One widely used method compressing music actually video compression standard called MPEG Moving Picture Experts Group
The name self explanatory mp stand moving picture version file used music
The full name standard come MPEG missing EG stand expert group consortium company researcher got together agree standard people could easily play video different brand equipment example could play DVD brand DVD player
The first version standard called three method storing sound track layer
One method layer became popular compressing music abbreviated
The standard used much video example DVDs TV mainly use remains important audio coding
The next MPEG version redundant became standard
offer higher quality video commonly used digital video file streaming medium disc broadcast TV
The AAC audio compression method used Apple among others also standard
On computer Part commonly used video often abbreviated
So stand layer stand part
Most audio compression method use similar approach method although offer better quality amount storage le storage quality
We wo go exactly work general idea break sound band different frequency represent band adding together value simple formula sum cosine wave precise
There also
Other audio compression system might come across include AAC ALAC Ogg Vorbis WMA
Each various advantage others compatible open others
The main question compressed audio small file made good quality human ear
There also question long take encode file might affect useful system
The tradeoff quality size audio file depend situation jogging listening music quality may matter much good reduce space available store
On hand someone listening recording home good sound system might mind large device store music long quality high
To evaluate audio compression choose variety recording high quality original typically CD using uncompressed WAV AIFF file
Choose different style music kind audio speech perhaps even create recording totally silent
Now convert recording different audio format
One system free download Apple iTunes used rip CDs variety format give choice setting quality size
A lot audio system able convert file plugins conversion
Compress recording using variety method making sure compressed file created high quality original
Make table showing long took process recording size compressed file evaluation quality sound compared original
Discuss tradeoff involved need much bigger file store good quality sound
Is limit small make file still sounding ok
Do method work better speech others
Does minute recording silence take space minute recording silence
Does minute recording music use space minute silence
The detail compression system work glossed chapter concerned file size speed method work
Most compression system variation idea covered although one fundamental method mentioned Huffman coding turn useful final stage method often one first topic mentioned textbook discussing compression brief
A closely related system Arithmetic coding
Also video compression omitted even though compressing video save space kind compression
Most video compression based MPEG standard Moving Pictures Experts Group
There information work
The method shown variation method
Many popular lossless compression method based although many variation one called LZW also used lot
Another compression method bzip based clever method called Transform
Questions like compression achieved addressed field

So I given following problem since I experience field I would really appreciate
These requirement So three time per second certain amount fixed per session value come
These value stored file timestamp per must possible time given timestamp interval read value stored file
This relatively simple produce file every hour
If file zipped leaf file compressable case ca instantly retreive datapoints would unzip entire file
So I thinking could solved like If would implemented properly possible uncompress individual datapoint file sorted timestamp finding right one trivial binary search
So I guess question I follwing Any form help greatly appreciated
If data sampled regular interval
three time per second sufficient store timestamp first point interval
This enables calulate offset timestamp vice versa grant access datapoint constant time
As others already laid always lose ability seek using compression scheme
Compress blockwise search within block
The family similar algorithm provide good compression data reoccurring string fail recognize relationship integer noisy slowly changing sequence
Below three sequence integer first consists constant value second count upward somehow resembles timestamps third noisy represents sensor reading
Zip greatly reduce size first sequence hard time second wo provide compression third
To reduce number bit per number range possible number must get smaller
If incorporate knowledge value change slowly conclude storing difference previous value yield value close zero
The three example sequence become If know rate change approximately constant case timestamps apply delta encoding twice
Below sequence timestamps original form applying delta encoding
All need way make average smaller number le disk space
We reduce number bit using variable width integer use le bit smaller magnitude number
The usual encoding This way integer encoded byte dependent actual value
One way compress file smaller chunk
Store content file sort index facilitate search
Alternatively since data stored time per second reflect time chunk file name search also easy
If would implemented properly possible uncompress individual datapoint That clearly well knowing compression workds possible compress data point much data small
I expect compression result near Zip would enough
Keep mind lossless compression algorithm guarantee rate
There theorem every algorithm make input
What good possible implement algorithm find pattern binary data
The concept human think pattern misleading
compression algorithm wo use pattern see
must possible time given timestamp interval read value stored file The solution clearly save smaller file
The size depends small need resulting file long decompression may take
Say file one hour sensor data small enough save one compressed file per hour
You look family compression algorithm
They work string data binary string
That said
I think overkill situation though
Sorry guy posted detailed answer I ended solving quite simple way
I ended compressing data point individually entry quite large kb compression rate possible
using zlib When new file created I reserve first part file serve table content
The file start contains first last timestamp found file current amount data point put file
Following long list equally sized containing timestamp offset file
Due reserved space header initially give file even data quickly negligable space saved compression
After table content datapoint compressed form one another
This make possible binary search right data even file several GB right data found matter millisecond
I initially set zlib took way time resulted minor change compression rate
And maximum stress entry barely keeping using

The idea data compression also deeply connected
There close connection compression system predicts sequence given entire history used optimal data compression using output distribution optimal compressor used prediction finding symbol compress best given previous history
This equivalence used justification using data compression benchmark general intelligence
Data compression viewed special case Data differencing consists producing given patching producing given data compression consists producing compressed file given target decompression consists producing target given compressed file
Thus one consider data compression data differencing empty source data compressed file corresponding difference nothing
This considering absolute corresponding data compression special case corresponding data differencing initial data
When one wish emphasize connection one may use term refer data differencing
Audio data compression confused potential reduce transmission storage requirement audio data
implemented audio
Lossy audio compression algorithm provide higher compression cost fidelity used numerous audio application
These algorithm almost rely eliminate reduce fidelity le audible sound thereby reducing space required store transmit
In lossy lossless compression reduced using method reduce amount information used represent uncompressed data
The acceptable loss audio quality transmission storage size depends upon application
For example one CD hold approximately one hour uncompressed music le hour music compressed losslessly hour music compressed format medium
A digital sound recorder typically store around hour clearly intelligible speech
Lossless audio compression produce representation digital data decompress exact digital duplicate original audio stream unlike playback lossy compression technique
Compression ratio around original size similar generic lossless data compression
Lossless compression unable attain high compression ratio due complexity rapid change sound form
Codecs like use estimate spectrum signal
Many algorithm use filter slightly spectrum thereby allowing traditional lossless compression work efficiently
The process reversed upon decompression
When audio file processed either compression desirable work unchanged original uncompressed losslessly compressed
Processing lossily compressed file purpose usually produce final result inferior creation compressed file uncompressed original
In addition sound editing mixing lossless audio compression often used archival storage master copy
A number lossless audio compression format exist

Some feature combination lossy format lossless correction allows stripping correction easily obtain lossy file
Such format include Scalable Lossless
Other format associated distinct system Lossy audio compression used wide range application
In addition direct application player computer digitally compressed audio stream used video DVDs digital television streaming medium satellite cable radio increasingly terrestrial radio broadcast
Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression lossless compression data percent percent original stream rather percent percent discarding data
The innovation lossy audio compression use recognize data audio stream perceived human
Most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy first identifying perceptually irrelevant sound sound hard hear
Typical example include high frequency sound occur time louder sound
Those sound coded decreased accuracy
Due nature lossy algorithm suffers file decompressed recompressed
This make lossy compression unsuitable storing intermediate result professional audio engineering application sound editing multitrack recording
However popular end user particularly megabyte store minute worth music adequate quality
To determine information audio signal perceptually irrelevant lossy compression algorithm use transforms MDCT convert sampled waveform transform domain
Once transformed typically component frequency allocated bit according audible

These coder use model sound generator human vocal tract LPC whiten audio signal flatten spectrum
LPC may thought basic perceptual coding technique reconstruction audio signal using linear predictor shape coder quantization noise spectrum target signal partially masking
Lossy format often used distribution streaming audio interactive application coding speech digital transmission cell phone network
In application data must decompressed data flow rather entire data stream transmitted
Not audio codecs used streaming application application codec designed stream data effectively usually chosen
Latency result method used encode decode data
Some codecs analyze longer segment data optimize efficiency code manner requires larger segment data one time decode
Often codecs create segment called frame create discrete data segment encoding decoding
The inherent coding algorithm critical example transmission data telephone conversation significant delay may seriously degrade perceived quality
In contrast speed compression proportional number operation required algorithm latency refers number sample must analysed block audio processed
In minimum case latency zero sample simply reduces number bit used quantize signal
Time domain algorithm LPC also often low latency hence popularity speech coding telephony
In algorithm however large number sample analyzed implement psychoacoustic model frequency domain latency order m m communication
important category audio data compression
The perceptual model used estimate human ear hear generally somewhat different used music
The range frequency needed convey sound human voice normally far narrower needed music sound normally le complex
As result speech encoded high quality using relatively low bit rate
If data compressed analog voltage varies time quantization employed digitize number normally integer
This referred conversion
If integer generated quantization bit entire range analog signal divided interval signal value within interval quantized number
If integer generated range analog signal divided interval
This relation illustrates compromise high resolution large number analog interval high compression small integer generated
This application quantization used several speech compression method
This accomplished general combination two approach Perhaps earliest algorithm used speech encoding audio data compression general

The powerful used method work comparing frame video previous one
If frame contains area nothing moved system simply issue short command copy part previous frame next one
If section frame move simple manner compressor emits slightly longer command tell decompressor shift rotate lighten darken copy
This longer command still remains much shorter intraframe compression
Interframe compression work well program simply played back viewer cause problem video sequence need edited
Because interframe compression copy data one frame another original frame simply cut lost transmission following frame reconstructed properly
Some compress frame independently using intraframe compression
Making video almost easy editing uncompressed video one find beginning ending frame simply copy frame one want keep discard frame one want
Another difference intraframe interframe compression intraframe system frame us similar amount data
In interframe system certain frame allowed copy data frame require much data frame nearby

The essential requirement memory management provide way dynamically allocate portion memory program request free reuse longer needed
This critical advanced computer system single might underway time
Several method devised increase effectiveness memory management
system separate memory address used process actual physical address allowing separation process increasing size beyond available amount using swapping
The quality virtual memory manager extensive effect overall system performance
Modern computer system manage memory two level memory management generally categorized either automatic memory management usually involving
The task fulfilling allocation request consists locating block unused memory sufficient size
Memory request satisfied allocating portion large pool memory called
At given time part heap use free unused thus available future allocation
Several issue complicate implementation arises many small gap allocated memory block invalidates use allocation request
The allocator also inflate size individually small allocation
This often managed
The memory management system must track outstanding allocation ensure overlap memory ever lost
The specific dynamic memory allocation algorithm implemented impact performance significantly
A study conducted illustrates involved variety allocator
The lowest average required allocate single memory slot measured instruction level variety software
Since precise location allocation known advance memory accessed indirectly usually
The specific algorithm used organize memory area allocate deallocate chunk interlinked may use following method block allocation also called memory pool allocation us block memory often size
This work well simple large object need allocated suffers especially long memory address
However due significantly reduced overhead method substantially improve performance object need frequent allocation often used
In system memory allocated several pool memory instead one pool represents block memory certain size block convenient size progression
All block particular size kept sorted new block formed allocation added respective memory pool later use
If smaller size requested available smallest available size selected split
One resulting part selected process repeat request complete
When block allocated allocator start smallest sufficiently large block avoid needlessly breaking block
When block freed compared buddy
If free combined placed correspondingly list
In many programming language implementation variable declared within procedure subroutine function local function runtime environment program automatically allocates memory variable program execution entry procedure automatically release memory procedure exited
Special declaration may allow local variable retain value invocation procedure may allow local variable access procedure
The automatic allocation local variable make possible depth limited available memory
Garbage collection strategy automatically detecting memory allocated object longer usable program returning allocated memory pool free memory location
This method contrast manual memory management programmer explicitly code memory request memory release program
While automatic garbage advantage reducing programmer workload preventing certain kind memory allocation bug garbage collection require memory resource compete application program processor time
method decoupling memory organization physical hardware
The application operate memory via
Each time attempt access stored data made virtual memory data order translate virtual address
In way addition virtual memory enables granular control memory system method access
In virtual memory system operating system limit access memory
This feature called used disallow process read write memory allocated preventing malicious malfunctioning code one program interfering operation another
Even though memory allocated specific process normally isolated process sometimes need able share information
one fastest technique
Memory usually classified access rate
Memory management system among operation also handle moving information two level memory

dboles Introduction In survey discus design tion conventional dynamic memory allocator
By mean allocator used general purpose storage program quest block memory store program object free block time
A heap sense pool memory available allocation deallocation block memory bitrary An allocated block typically used store program kind tured data item Pascal record C struct object necessarily object sense Throughout paper assume block use program content data object relocated compact memory done example copying garbage collector
This usual situation plementations conventional programming system C Pascal Ada etc
memory manager nd update pointer program object The allocator This sense confused quite dierent sense meaning partially ordered tree structure
While typical situation one
The stored allocator need correspond directly object
An ple growable array represented xed size part hold pointer part
The routine grows object might allocate new larger part copy content old part deallocate old part
We assume allocator know nothing would view part separate dent object even normal programmer would see object
It also true many system
In examine data stored block modify act way
The data area within block used hold object contiguous ping range real virtual memory
We generally assume entire block allocated freed allocator entirely unaware type value data stored know size requested
Scope survey
In survey concentrate issue overall memory usage rather time cost
We believe detailed measure time cost usually red herring scure issue strategy policy believe good strategy yield good policy amenable ecient implementation
We lieve easier make fast allocator one using fairly forward technique Section
Beyond certain point however eectiveness speed tions depend many subtle issue determine memory usage
We also discus locality reference brie
Locality reference increasingly important dierence CPU speed main memory disk speed grown dramatically sign stopping
Locality poorly understood however aside frommaking important general comment leave issue locality future research
Except locality issue explicitly noted assume cost unit memory xed uniform
We address possible interaction unusual memory hierarchy scheme pressed caching may complicate locality issue interact important way allocator design
We discus specialized allocator ular application data representation allocator design insucient information available piler programmer allow safe relocation especially likely system code written ent language combined application
In others concurrent system cult garbage collector relocate data incurring undue overhead disruptiveness
Examples inlude specialized allocator block processing system specialized storage lapping string shared structure allocator Allocators kind system share many property allocator cuss introduce many complicating design choice
In particular often allow logically contiguous item stored piece one xed size may allow sharing part form data compression

Summary Conclusions Models Theories Strategies Policies Mechanisms Experiments Data Challenges Opportunities Motivation This paper motivated perception considerable confusion nature memory allocator problem memory tion general
Worse confusion often ognized allocator widely thought fairly well understood
In fact know little allocator known twenty year ago much might expected
The literature subject rather inconsistent scattered considerable work appears done using proaches quite limited
We try sketch unifying conceptual framework understanding known suggest promising proaches new research
This problem allocator literature siderable practical importance

We think likely widespread use poor allocator incurs loss main cache memory CPU cycle upwards billion dollar signicant fraction world ory processor output may squandered huge Perhaps even worse eect programming style due widespread use allocator simply bad better allocator known widely known understood allocation research failed address This unreliable estimate based admittedly sual computation approximately low order million PC world

proper issue
Many programmer avoid heap tion many situation perceived space time It seems signicant u many article refereed number refereed lications outside major journal operating tems programming motivated extreme concern speed memory cost general heap allocation
One paper discussed Section
Often ad hoc solution used application atic least eral allocator quite well workload question
We suspect case perception wrong cost modern heap allocation simply overestimated
In many case however appears allocator lead widespread quite standable belief general heap allocation sarily expensive
Too many poor allocator supplied operating system compiler practitioner aware alternative
This appears changing degree
Many operating system supply fairly good allocator increasing trend toward marketing braries include general allocator least claimed good replacement fault allocator
It seems likely simply lag improvement allocator technology widespread adoption another lag programming style adapts
The combined lag quite long however seen several magazine ticles last year avoid using general allocator
Postings praising ad hoc allocation scheme common Usenet newsgroups oriented toward programming
The slow adoption better technology lag change perception may lem however
We doubt well allocator really known work based fairly thorough review literature
We wonder whether part perception due occasional It impression UNIX programmer usage heap allocation went signicantly Chris ley allocator distributed BSD simply much faster allocator accustomed
Unfortunately tor somewhat wasteful space

This seem unlikely ments used workload extremely unlikely generate atic request pattern real program

A signicant number real program could exhibit problematic behavior pattern simply represented study date
process operating tems interactive programming environment networked server may pose special problem addressed
Most experiment date studied program execute minute common workstation
Little known happens program run hour day week month
It may well seemingly good allocator work well long run memory eciency slowly ing perform quite badly
We fairly sure nobody know

The worst case performance general tor amount complete failure due memory haustion virtual memory thrashing Section
This mean real allocator may lurking fail unexpectedly seemingly reasonable input
Such problem may hidden grammers encounter severe problem may simply code around using ad hoc storage management still painfully common ically allocating memory structure
These approach storage agement lead software hidden tations due use array
The impact software clarity exibility maintainability reliability quite important dicult mate
It underestimated however cause hidden cost incur major penalty productivity put plainly human cost sheer frustration anxiety general suering
A much larger broader set test application experiment needed ance allocator work reliably crucial performance le work well
Given caveat however appears allocator clearly better others case per attempt explain dierences
What Allocator Must Do An allocator must keep track part ory use part free
The goal allocator design usually minimize wasted space without undue time cost vice versa
The ideal cator would spend negligible time managing memory waste negligible space
A conventional allocator control ber size live entirely program requesting releasing space managed allocator
A conventional allocator also compact memory moving block around make contiguous free contiguous memory
It must respond immediately request space decided block memory allocate change block memory must regarded inviolable program chooses free
It deal ory free choose free ory allocate next requested block
Allocators record location size free block ory kind hidden data structure may linear list totally partially ordered tree bitmap hybrid data structure
An allocator therefore online algorithm must respond request strict sequence ately decision irrevocable
The problem allocator must address application program may free block der creating amid live object
If hole numerous small used satisfy future request larger block
This lem known fragmentation tially disastrous one
For general case application program may allocate object arbitrary time free later reliable rithm ensuring ecient memory usage none We use term rather generally plication allocator manages storage may system program le server even operating system kernel

It proven possible allocation algorithm always bility application program allocate deallocate block fashion defeat locator strategy force severe tation
Not provably good allocation algorithm proof allocator possible application
The lower bound worst case fragmentation generally proportional amount live multiplied logarithm ratio largest smallest block size M n M amount live data n ratio tween smallest largest object size
In discussing memory cost ally assume block size evenly divisible smallest block size n sometimes ply called largest block size unit smallest
Of course algorithm worst case much worse often proportional simple product M So example minimum maximum jects size one word million word fragmentation worst case may cost lent allocator factor ten twenty space
A le robust allocator may lose factor million worst case wasting much space failure almost certain
Given apparent insolubility problem may seem surprising dynamic memory allocation used inmost system computing world grind halt due lack memory

Little known action program allocator program likely bring worst locator
However one thing program behaved sense
Most program combined common allocator der huge amount memory even may waste quarter half occasionally even
That regularity program behavior allocator exploit point often ciently appreciated even professional design implement allocator
These regularity ploited allocator prevent excessive tion make possible allocator work practice
These regularity surprisingly poorly stood despite year allocator research score paper dozen researcher
Strategies Placement Policies Splitting Coalescing The main technique used allocator keep mentation control placement choice
Two subsidiary technique used help implement choice splitting block satisfy smaller request coalescing free block yield larger block
Placement choice simply choosing free memory put requested block
Despite tially fatal restriction allocator online choice allocator also huge freedom place requested block anywhere nd suciently large range free memory anywhere within range
It may also able simply quest memory operating system
An allocator algorithm therefore regarded mechanism implement placement policy motivated strategy minimizing mentation
Strategy policy strategy take account regularity program behavior determines range acceptable policy allocate requested block
The chosen icy implemented mechanism set algorithm data structure use
This distinction quite important
In context general memory allocation strategy attempt exploit regularity request stream policy implementable decision procedure placing block memory amechanism set algorithm data tures implement policy often ply called algorithm
An ideal strategy block cause fragmentation later unfortunately possible guarantee real strategy attempt heuristically approximate ideal based sumed regularity application program behavior
For example one strategy letting small lived object prevent reclaiming larger tiguous free area
This part strategy ing common family policy
Another part strategy split block potentially waste left minimize size wasted part
The corresponding best policy say use smallest block least large enough satisfy request
The placement policy determines exactly memory requested block allocated
For best policy general rule object smallest free block least big enough This set distinction doubtless indirectly uenced work dierent area notably Marr work natural articial visual system Clamrock work philosophy science nition
The distinction tant understanding wide variety complex tems however
Similar distinction made many eld including empirical computer science though ten without making quite clear
In work mechanism policy often distinguished strategy policy usually distinguished explicitly
This make sense text policy safely assumed plement strategy choice strategy left someone else designer code discussion
In empirical evaluation poorly understood strategy however distinction strategy policy often crucial
For example error implementation strategy often misinterpreted evidence expected regularity ally exist fact slightly dierent strategy would work much better
Mistakes possible level equally important mistake possible level attempt implement strategy policy policy mechanism
hold
That complete policy however may several equally good t complete policy must specify chosen example one whose address lowest
The chosen policy implemented specic mechanism chosen implement policy ciently term time space overhead
For best linear list ordered tree structure might used record address size free block tree search list search would used nd one dictated policy
These level allocator design process act
A strategy may yield obvious complete policy seemingly slight dierences similar policy may actually implement interestingly dierent strategy
This result poor derstanding interaction application behavior allocator strategy
The chosen policy may obviously implementable reasonable cost space time programmer eort case approximation may used instead
The strategy policy often dened well policy mechanism arrived combination educated guessing trial error often dubious experimental In case important distinction strategy icy mechanism clear metaphorical ple may help
Consider software company strategy improving productivity reward productive programmer
It may institute policy rewarding programmer produce largest bers line program code
To implement policy may use mechanism instructing manager count line code providing script count line code according particular algorithm
This example illustrates possible failure level mapping one level another
The strategy may simply wrong programmer particularly motivated money
The policy may implement intended strategy line code inappropriate metric productivity policy unintended eects due programmer resentment
The mechanism may also fail implement ied policy rule enforced manager supplied script correctly implement intended counting function
This distinction strategy policy simplied may multiple level egy shade increasingly concrete policy
At dierent level abstraction something might Splitting coalescing
Two general technique supporting range implementation ment policy splitting coalescing free block
These mechanism important subsidiary part larger mechanism allocator implementation
The allocator may split large block smaller block arbitrarily use block satisfy request
The remainder splitting recorded smaller free block right used satisfy future request
The allocator may also coalesce merge adjacent free block yield larger free block
After block freed allocator may check see whether neighboring block free well merge single larger block
This often desirable cause one large block likely useful two small small request ed large block
Completely general splitting coalescing supported fairly modest cost space time using simple mechanism describe later
This allows allocator designer maximum dom choosing strategy policy mechanism allocator allocator plete accurate record range memory available time
The cost may negligible however cially splitting coalescing work viewed strategy policy
The key point least three tatively dierent kind level abstraction involved upper level general sign goal exploiting expected regularity set strategy may subsidiary gy example resolve con icts strategy best possible way
At somewhat lower level general policy place object detailed policy exactly determines placement
Below actual mechanism tended implement policy presumably fect strategy using whatever algorithm data structure deemed appropriate
Mechanisms ten layered well usual manner structured programming
Problems level best computation may improperly specied may meet specication
Analogous problem occur upper level occur expected regularity actually occur occur strategy actually exploit
case freed block usually coalesced neighbor form large block free memory later allocation split smaller chunk block obtained desired size
It ten turn eort wasted cause size requested later largely size freed earlier old small block could reused without coalescing splitting
cause many modern allocator use deferred avoid coalescing splitting time use intermittently combat mentation
A Closer Look Fragmentation How Study It In section discus traditional tion fragmentation usual technique used studying
We explain usual derstanding strong enough support scientic design evaluation allocator
We propose new though nearly obvious conception tation cause describe suitable niques used study
Most experiment ing sound technique performed last year notable exception done much earlier discussed Section
Internal External Fragmentation Traditionally fragmentation classed external internal combatted splitting coalescing free block
External fragmentation arises free block memory available allocation ca used hold object size actually requested gram
In sophisticated allocator usually cause free block small program request larger object
In simple allocator ternal fragmentation occur allocator unwilling unable split large block smaller one
Internal fragmentation arises free block allocated hold object poor block larger needed
In allocator remainder simply wasted ing internal fragmentation
It called internal cause wasted memory inside allocated block rather recorded free block right
To combat internal fragmentation allocator split block multiple part allocating part block regarding remainder smaller free block right
Many allocator also coalesce adjacent free block ing free block address order combining larger block used satisfy request larger object
In allocator internal fragmentation arises due implementation constraint within speed simplicity reason allocator design restricts way memory may subdivided
In allocator internal fragmentation may cepted part strategy prevent external allocator may unwilling ment block may able coalesce later use hold another large object
The Traditional Methodology Probabilistic Analyses Simulation Using Synthetic Traces Note reader uninterested experimental methodology may wish skip section least rst reading
Readers uninterested history allocator research may skip footnote
The lowing section quite important however skipped
Allocators sometimes evaluated using bilistic analysis
By reasoning likelihood certain event consequence event future event may possible predict happen average
For general problem dynamic storage allocation however ic dicult algorithm workload
An alternative lations nd really pen workload interact allocator policy
This common interaction poorly understood mathematical technique dicult apply
Unfortunately case make probabilistic technique feasible important characteristic workload must probability relevant characteristic event location routine
The relevant characteristic understood probability simply known
This one major point paper
The paradigm statistical used theory memory allocation believe wrong paradigm least usually plied
Strong assumption made frequency individual event allocation tions base statistic probabilistic model developed think false
The great success mechanic area due fact assumption make sense
Gas law pretty good idealization aggregate eects large number individual event collision molecule concisely express important regularity
This paradigm inappropriate memory cation two reason
The rst simply number object involved usually small asymptotic analysis relevant important reason
The main weakness mechanic approach important systematic teractions occur memory allocation due phase behavior program
No matter large system basing probabilistic analysis individual event likely yield wrong answer systematic eects involved captured theory
Assuming analysis priate large system help systematic error simply attain greater statistical signicance
Consider case evolutionary biology
If overly simple statistical approach individual animal interaction used theory ture relationship sexual selection pervasive evolutionary fects niche Developing highly predictive This usage mechanic perhaps regarded metaphorical since really simple interaction large number molecule gas liquid
Several paper memory allocation used loosely however describe gous approach analyzing memory allocation
tical mechanic literally provided original smaller sense rather larger Kuhnian many nd attractive
Some eects may emerge eling simulation reliably predict many important issue must modeled correctly sucient data usually available evolutionary theory extremely would say many detail may intrinsic unpredictability system described We saying development good theory memory allocation hard ing predictive evolutionary
The problem memory allocation seems far simpler optimistic useful predictive theory Our point simply paradigm simple statistical mechanic must evaluated relative alternative nd plausible domain
There major interaction load allocator policy usually ignored
No matter large system matter asymptotic analysis ignoring eects seems likely yield major analysis simply yield wrong asymptote
A useful probabilistic theory memory allocation may possible based quite dierent set statistic used capture eects systematicities rather assuming systematicities nored
As biology theory must tested reality rened capture systematicities previously gone unnoticed
Random traditional technique evaluating allocator construct several trace recorded sequence allocation deallocation quest thought resemble workload use trace drive variety actual allocator

For example dierent evolutionary strategy plied varying replication technique tion rate virus impact environmental change action
For example single chance mutation result adaptive characteristic one individual may major impact subsequent evolution specie entire ecosystem
We also suggesting evolutionary theory vides good paradigm allocator research example good scientic paradigm dierent one typically seen memory tion research
It demonstrates important sary interplay theory detailed empirical work
Since allocator normally responds quest sequence produce accurate lations allocator would workload real program generated request sequence
Typically however request sequence real trace behavior actual program
They trace generated cally small subprogram subprogram signed resemble real program certain cal way
In particular object size distribution thought important aect mentation memory block varying size
ject lifetime distribution also often thought important always aect whether block memory occupied free
Given set object size lifetime distribution small subprogram generates sequence request obeys distribution
This driver simply loop repeatedly generates request ing number generator point simulation next data object chosen picking size lifetime bias probabilistically preserve desired tions
The driver also maintains table object allocated yet freed ordered scheduled death deallocation time
That step allocated plus chosen lifetime
At step simulation driver deallocates object whose death time cate expired
One convenient measure simulated volume object allocated sum size object allocated step An important feature simulation tend reach state
After running certain amount time volume live In many early simulation simulator modeled real time rather discrete step allocation deallocation
Allocation time chosen based domly chosen time generated using arrival distribution death scheduled tinuous discrete time based number size object allocated far
We generally ignore distinction paper think issue important
As come clear methodology favor distinction important actual sequence action sucient guarantee exact simulation tual sequence event recorded rather approximately emulated
lated object reach level determined size lifetime distribution jects allocated deallocated approximately equal number
The memory usage tends vary little wandering probabilistically random walk around likely level
Measurements typically made sampling memory usage point steady state presumably reached averaging period variation
These measurement equilibrium assumed important
There three common variation lation technique
One use simple ical function determine size lifetime tributions uniform negative exponential
Exponential distribution often used observed program typically likely allocate small object large likely allocate object The size distribution ally truncated plausible minimum imum object size discretized rounding nearest integer
The second variation pick distribution itively hat way thought semble real program behavior
One motivation model fact many program allocate jects size others small number refer distribution
The third variation use statistic gathered real program make distribution tic
In almost case size lifetime distribution Historically uniform size distribution common early experiment exponential distribution became increasingly common new data came available showing real system generally used many small object large one
Other tributions also used notably Poisson
Still relatively recent paper used uniform size distribution sometimes distribution
As size distribution shift time toward lifetime distribution often exponential
This shift occurred later probably real data size information easier obtain lifetime data appeared later
In general modeling precise
Sometimes size chosen hat allocated uniform proportion rather skewed proportion ecting fact average program allocate many small object large one
assumed fact ent size object may dierent lifetime utions generally assumed unimportant
In general something trend toward use realistic trend dominant
Even researcher ten use simple smooth mathematical function generate trace allocator The use smooth distribution questionable bear directly issue object size allocated free ble block likely size making possible nd perfect If object size smoothly distributed requested size almost always slightly dierent increasing chance fragmentation
Probabilistic Knuth derivation percent rule discussed later Section many attempt son probabilistically interaction program behavior allocator policy ass overall cost term fragmentation usually CPU time
These analysis generally made sumptions simulation random object allocation order independence size lifetime often stronger assumption well
These simplifying assumption generally made order make mathematics tractable
In particular assumption randomness dence make possible apply theory The trend toward realistic distribution plained historically pragmatically
In early day computing distribution interest usually distribution segment size operating tem workload
Without access inside erating system data dicult obtain
Most researcher would allowed modify implementation operating system running valuable computer
Later emphasis study shifted away segment size segmented operating system toward data ject size virtual memory individual process running paged virtual memory
We unclear except ticular theoretical experimental paradigm simply become thoroughly entrenched early
It also somewhat easier dealing real data
stochastic process Markov model etc
derive analytical result expected behavior
nately assumption tend false real program result limited utility
It noted merely nient simplifying assumption allow solution problem closely resemble real problem
If case one could expect renement sucient empirical validation assumption matter result would come close reality
There reason expect happy outcome
These assumption dramatically change key feature problem ability perform analysis hinge fact make themmuch le relevant general problem memory allocation
Assumptions randomness independence make problem irregular supercial sense make smooth hence mathematically tractable probabilistic sense
This smoothness advantage make possible derive analytical result disadvantage turn real deep scientic problem ematical puzzle much le signicant purpose
The problem dynamic storage allocation tractable vernacular sense word
As essentially problem grip simply stand input
problem make mathematically tractable handle something fundamentally irregular making unlikely get real purchase leverage important issue
Removing irregularity remove portunities well
A note dom lifetime distribution become quite common empirical alytic study memory fragmentation last two decade
In case empirical work using simulation seems admirable adjustment observed characteristic real program behavior
In case analytic study turn convenient cal property well
Unfortunately appears apparently exponential appearence real lifetime distribution often artifact experimental odology explained Sections emphasis distribution tends tract researcher strongly patterned ing process actually generate explained Section
We invite reader consider ordered trace exponential lifetime tion
In case correlation object age expected time decay property distribution randomness ensure allocated object die pletely random way estimate death time information available An exponential random function exhibit property pattern much like radioactive decay
In sense exponential time thus reductio ad absurdum thetic trace ularities systematically eliminated input
If view allocator job online lem detecting exploiting regularity see put allocator awkward position trying extract helpful hint pure noise
This necessarily mean allocator perform identically randomized workload however regularity size utions whether real distribution simple mathematical one allocator may simply shoot foot
Analyses experiment exponentially tributed random lifetime may say something ing happens allocator strategy completely orthogonal actual regularity
We real idea whether situation cur regularly space possible combination real workload reasonable It clear usual case however
The terrain space quite mysterious u
A note Markov probabilistic study memory allocation used We indebted Henry Baker made quite similar observation respect use tial lifetime distribution estimate eectiveness generational garbage collection scheme
In particular certain eects randomized trace may may resemble cumulative eect tor strategy error much longer period
This semblance assumed good reason think may occur case others empirical validation necessary
Markov process approximate program cator behavior derived conclusion based property Markov model
In Markov model probability state transition known xed
In case fragmentation study corresponds assuming program allocates object random xed probability allocating dierent size
The space possible state memory viewed graph node conguration cated free block
There start state ing empty memory transition probability possible allocation size
For given ment policy known transition given state possible allocation deallocation request
The state reached possible allocation another conguration memory
For given request distribution work possible state reachable start state via succession le probable transition
In general memory small size arbitrary distribution size lifetime network inconceivably large
As described far therefore useless practical analysis
To make problem tractable certain sumptions often made
One time exponentially distributed well random convenient property described die completely random well born random
This assumption used ensure state transition state inite probability long run
That one run simulation long enough period time reachable state would reached would reached many number time reached would ect probability reached future simulation continued indenitely
If put counter state keep track number time state reached ratio count would eventually stabilize plus minus small variation
The tive weight counter would stable solution
Such network state called ergodicMarkov model convenient mathematical erties
In case possible avoid running simulation analytically derive network probabiblities would converge
Unfortunately inappropriate model real program allocator behavior
An ergodic Markov model kind probabilistic nite tomaton pattern generates simple though randomized hence predictable
They almost unpatterned fact hence predictable certain probabilistic sense
Such automaton extremely unlikely ate many pattern seem likely important real program creation object linked list one order later destruction exactly order exactly reverse There much powerful kind complex state like real capable generating realistic tern
Unfortunately machine sure generate kind pattern actual real program
We understand regularity exist real program well enough model formally perform probabilistic analysis directly cable real program behavior
The model grossly inaccurate respect quite vant problem memory allocation
There problem Markov model useful smaller number problem sumptions ergodicity appropriate
These lem involve process literally random shown eectively random sary way
The general heap allocation problem either category
If clear next section make much clearer
Ergodic Markov model also sometimes used problem basic assumption known false used way validated shown tensive testing produce right answer time despite oversimplications based
For problem turn dierences real system cal model usually signicant
For general problem memory allocation turn false result clearly invalidate use Technically Markov model eventually generate pattern probability generating ticular pattern within nite period time ingly small pattern large strongly ected arc weight
That many quite able kind pattern extremely improbable simple Markov model
simple Markov model What Fragmentation Really Is Why Traditional Approach Unsound A single death tragedy
A million death statistic
Stalin We suggested shape size tribution smoothness might important determining fragmentation caused load
However even distribution completely realistic reason suspect randomized synthetic trace likely grossly unrealistic
As said earlier allocator embody strategy designed exploit regularity program expected ticularly well
The use randomized allocation order eliminates regularity workload duce others every reason think dierences regularity aect mance dierent strategy dierently
To make concrete must understand fragmentation cause
The technical distinction internal ternal fragmentation useful attempting It might seem problem use order Markov model whose state node ability graph correspond directly state memory
Perhaps Markov model would work node graph represent sequence crete state transition
We think false well
The important kind pattern produced real program generally simple quences event pattern ing many event
To capture Markov model would high order analysis would completely infeasible
It would essentially generate specic literal sequence event
This begs essential question real program seems certain cisely capture right regularity
Markov model simply powerful abstract enough right help problem
They used purpose similarly poorly understood purpose complex pattern may important
At least without extensive validation
The fact regularity complex unknown good reason assume eectively random Section
design experiment measuring fragmentation worthwhile stop moment consider fragmentation really arises
Fragmentation inability reuse memory free
This due policy choice cator may choose reuse memory principle could reused
More importantly purpose allocator may choice moment allocation request must serviced may free area small service request whose neighbor free making impossible coalesce adjacent free area ciently large contiguous Note latter fundamental kind fragmentation problem function program request stream choice allocate requested object
In satisfying request allocator usually erable leeway may place requested object suciently large free area
On hand allocator control ordering quest piece memory object freed
We made notion fragmentation ticularly clear quantiable cident
An allocator inability reuse memory pends number size hole future behavior program ture response allocator
That complex matter interaction patterned workload strategy
For example suppose free block size free block size
Is memory highly fragmented
It depends
If future request size allocator ne using size block splitting size block necessary
But future request block size problem
Also future request block size block size whether problem may depend order request arrive allocator Beck make clear statement ciple found exhausting review literature
As explain later ical review Section Beck also made tant inference principle theoretical model empirical methodology weakened working within dominant paradigm
His paper seldom cited important idea generally gone unnoticed
decision place
Best well example allocator better example best form abysmally
We leave concept fragmentation somewhat poorly dened general case actual phenomenon poorly Fragmentation caused isolated death
A crucial issue creation free area whose neighboring area free
This function two thing object placed adjacent area object die
Notice tor place object together memory die time intervening allocation fragmentation result object live time using contiguous memory die free contiguous memory
An allocator predict object die approximately time exploit information reduce fragmentation placing object contiguous memory
Fragmentation caused arises change way program us example freeing small block requesting large one
This much obvious important consider pattern changing behavior program ing large number object allocation large number object dierent type
Many gram allocate free dierent kind object Our concept fragmentation called nonoperational must confess degree
We think strength however better leave concept vague dene prematurely correctly
It important rst identify ral kind phenomenon study gure important characteristic
We currently working developing operational measure related program behavior
Later paper express experimental mentation result percentage viewed operational shorthand eects fragmentation memory usage whatever point point program execution measurement made clear context
dierent stereotyped way
Some kind object cumulate time kind may used bursty pattern
This discussed detail Section
The allocator job exploit pattern possible least let pattern undermine strategy
Implications experimental methodology
Note section concerned tal technique uninterested reader may skip following section
The traditional methodology using random gram behavior implicitly assumes dering information request stream could exploited nothing sequencing request allocator use hint suggest object located adjacent object
Given dom request stream allocator little wherever object placed allocator die random randomly creating hole among live object
If allocator fact tend exploit real regularity request stream tion order object creation simulation ensures information discarded allocator use
Likewise algorithm tends systematically make mistake faced real pattern allocation deallocations tion may hide fact
It clear random object death may systematically create serious fragmentation way unlikely realistic
Randomization also potentially large eect aggregate behavior large number object
In real program total volume object varies time often relative volume object dierent size varies well
This often occurs due phase phase may use many object others object used one phase may dierent size used another phase
Now consider randomized synthetic overall volume object determined random walk volume object rise gradually til steady state reached
Likewise volume memory allocated object given size similar random walk
If number object given size large random walk tend relatively smooth mostly gradual small change overall allocated volume
This implies portion memory allocated object tend relatively stable
This major implication external tation
External fragmentation mean free block memory size wrong size satisfy current need
This happens object one size freed object another size unfortunate change relative proportion object one size object larger size
For locator never split block happen request smaller size well
For synthetic dom trace le likely systematically free object one size cate object another
Instead tend allocate free object dierent size relatively stable proportion
This minimizes need coalesce jacent free area avoid fragmentation average free memory block given size reused atively soon
This may bias experimental result hiding allocator inability deal well ternal fragmentation favor allocator deal well internal fragmentation cost external fragmentation
Notice random death cause tation aggregate behavior random walk may reduce extent problem
For tor balance unrealistically bad tically good property may average something like realism others may
Even sheer trace turn yield tic fragmentation average many allocator inadequate comparing dierent allocator usually primary goal study
Some Real Program Behaviors suddenly memory return
Proust Swann Way Real program generally behave designed solve actual problem method chosen solve problem strong eect pattern memory usage
To begin understand allocator task necessary general understanding program behavior
This understanding almost absent literature memory allocator apparently many searcher consider innite variation possible program behavior daunting
There strong regularity many real gram however similar technique plied dierent combination solve many lem
Several common pattern observed
Ramps peak plateau
In term overall memory usage time three pattern observed variety program variety text
Not program exhibit pattern seem exhibit one two three degree
Any generalization based pattern must therefore qualitative ed
This implies understand quantitative importance pattern small set program sucient
Ramps
Many program accumulate certain data structure monotonically time
This may keep log event strategy requires building large representation solution found quickly
program use memory bursty tern building relatively large data structure used duration particular phase discarding data structure
Note data structure likely dierent type cause represent result phase posed intermediate value may resented dierently
A peak like ramp shorter duration
Plateaus
Many program build data tures quickly use data structure long period often nearly whole running time program
These pattern anecdotal perience many people research garbage collection cent study C program
It may thought garbage collected system suciently dierent using conventional age management result relevant
It appears however pattern common kind system similar strategy used programmer kind system
For particular problem dierent tive program behavior may result general egories seem common conventional program well
See
Other pattern overall memory usage also occur appear le common
As describe Section backward ramp function observed
Combined forward backward ramp behavior also observed one data structure shrinking another grows
Notice case ramp peak looking statistical distribution object lifetime may misleading
A statistical bution suggests random decay process sort may actually ect sudden death group object born dierent time
In term fragmentation dierence two el major
For statistical decay process cator faced isolated death likely cause fragmentation
For phased process many object often die time tor presented opportunity get back signicant amount memory
In real program pattern may composed dierent way dierent scale space time
A ramp may viewed kind peak grows entire duration program execution
The distinction ramp peak cise tend use refer something grows slowly whole execution gram drop suddenly end refer volume object discarded end execution
A peak may also top making kind tall skinny plateau
While overall pattern often ramp plateau often smaller feature peak teus added
This crude model program havior thus recursive
We note erally one scale may bear resemblance feature another scale
Attempting characterize behavior program simple number fractal dimension appropriate program behavior We using term rather loosely mon area
Typically model program behavior innitely recursive actually graftals nite recursive entity
We believe applies study locality erence well
Attempts characterize memory encing behavior severely memory allocation behavior generally fractal behavior depends memory Ramps peak plateus dierent plication fragmentation
An overall ramp plateau prole nient property fragmentation avoided long term fragmentation problem either
Since data making plateau stable making ramp accumulate ally inability reuse freed memory nothing freed end program execution
fragmentation cumulative lem however leaving many small hole mass long
Peaks tall skinny plateau pose challenge term fragmentation since many object cated freed many object likely allocated freed later
If earlier phase leaf scattered survivor may cause problem later phase must use space
More generally phase behavior major cause program need block particular size change time awkward way
If many small object freed end scattered object later phase may run trouble
On hand survivor pen placed together large contiguous area come free
Fragmentation peak period program execution equal
The portant period usually ory used
Fragmentation le important time lower overall memory usage ory usage peak either peak near end ramp gradually location policy
We suspect understanding program behavior level ences object well level reference memory
If fractal concept used strong sense believe simply wrong
If taken weak sense believe conveys little useful tion could better summarized simple tistical using fractal conceptual work tends obscure issue clary
erage program behavior may resemble fractal similar feature occur dierent scale dierent program however individual program behavior general simple Markov process
Both kind model fail capture regular kind pattern important
ing memory usage
This mean average tation le important peak scattered hole heap time may problem hole count
This implication interpretation y simulation based behavior equilibrium condition
Real program may hibit behavior ally ramp peak well
It appears program never reach truly steady state reach temporary steady state may matter much
It matter however earlier phase may result conguration block le problematic later peak usage
Overall memory usage whole story course
Locality reference matter well
All thing equal however larger total matter even locality
In virtual memory many program never page suer dramatic mance degradation
Keeping overall memory usage lower make le likely happen
In machine larger footprint likely mean dierent process page evicted peak reached rather page
Exploiting ordering size dependency
If allocator exploit phase information request stream may able place object die time contiguous area memory
This may suggest allocator much simpler strategy also seem likely work Objects allocated time likely die together end phase object allocated contiguous memory free contiguous memory
Objects dierent type may likely serve dierent purpose die dierent time
Size likely related type purpose avoiding intermingling dierent size likely type object may reduce scattering object among one
Barrett Zorn recently built allocator using prole information heuristically separate object one
Section
This suggests object allocated time allocated adjacent memory possible ment object segregated Implications strategy
The phased behavior many program provides opportunity locator reduce fragmentation
As said successive object allocated contiguously freed time free memory contiguous
We suspect happens many existing though signed principle mind far tell
It may well accidental major way good allocator keep tion low
Implications research
A major goal tor research determine pattern common exploited least guarded
Strategies work well one program may work poorly another may possible combine strategy single robust policy work well almost program
If fails may possible small set allocator dierent property least one work well vast majority real problem
We caution blindly experimenting ferent combination program complex mized allocator however
It important determine regularity exist real program havior decide strategy We found mention heuristic literature although somewhat similar idea derlie allocator Ross system discussed later
Beck Demers et al
Barrett Zorn developed system predict lifetime object similar purpose
We note purpose necessary predict group object die
It necessary predict group object die similar time die dissimilar time without worrying group die rst
We refer time discrimination
This simpler discrimination seems easier achieve time prediction possibly robust
Intuitively also seems directly related cause fragmentation
appropriate good strategy bined successfully
This say experiment many variation many design midst experiment goal identify fundamental action rather thing work well test application

We mainly study heap stack data structure act storage allocation area memory
Is queue also storage allocation area memory
As far I know process control block made OS region actually also act storage allocation area I consider queue storage allocation area memory
You misled homonym
There container item added time recently added removed
And function argument local variable return value return address
There one stack memory area per thread
The two concept name stack memory area organized stack data structure item added function call executed removed upon return function since function call nested item removed last one added yet removed
There tree ordered item node hold smaller value
And storage allocated dynamically
There one heap per process
The two concept completely unrelated name finite supply English word roughly right connotation happens word picked
There reason word name data structure also name area memory
There queue data structure operating system course area memory called
Process control block organized queue storage allocation area common name place memory operating system store information process every operating system information one place every OS description mention control
seems studied computer architecture yet
I try explain
You ca OS use queue storage location memory heap stack implented hardware
To use queue storage area need hardware
To know heap work see

Think model
Is data structure allocate contiguous chunk memory length like
malloc C free avoiding memory segmentation executes every operation deterministic O log n time n total size memory
By avoiding memory segmentation I mean total number free cell F I able allocate contiguous segment F cell F cell
Even without time bound impossible avoid memory segmentation unless move allocated object around like compacting garbage collector
See Robson Bounds Some Functions Concerning Dynamic Storage Allocation show allocating byte block size n N requires byte memory
Additionally buddy system achieves bound done logarithmic time
This paper exactly address question memory allocation move thing cost

In form automatic
The attempt reclaim memory occupied longer use
Garbage collection invented around simplify manual memory management
Garbage collection often portrayed opposite requires programmer specify object deallocate return memory system
However many system use combination approach including technique
Like memory management technique garbage collection may take significant proportion total processing time program result significant influence performance
With good implementation enough memory depending application garbage collection faster manual memory management opposite also true often case past GC algorithm
Resources memory database device descriptor typically handled garbage collection
Methods used manage resource particularly may suffice manage memory well leaving need GC
Some GC system allow resource associated region memory collected cause resource reclaimed called
Finalization may introduce complication limiting usability intolerable latency disuse reclaim especially limited resource lack control performs work reclaiming
The basic principle garbage collection find data object program accessed future reclaim resource used object
Many require garbage collection either part example effectively practical implementation example formal language like said
Other language designed use manual memory management implementation available example
Some language like allow garbage collection application using separate collected manually managed object others like allow user manually delete object also entirely disable garbage collection speed required
While integrating garbage collection language enables much wider choice method GC system exist including require recompilation
GC sometimes distinguished
The garbage collector almost always closely integrated
Garbage collection free programmer manually dealing memory deallocation
As result certain category eliminated substantially reduced Some bug addressed garbage collection security implication
Typically garbage collection certain disadvantage including consuming additional resource performance impact possible stall program execution incompatibility manual resource management
Garbage collection consumes computing resource deciding memory free even though programmer may already known information
The penalty convenience annotating object lifetime manually source code lead decreased uneven performance
A paper came conclusion GC need five time memory compensate overhead perform fast explicit memory management
Interaction memory hierarchy effect make overhead intolerable circumstance hard predict detect routine testing
The impact performance also given Apple reason adopting garbage collection despite desired feature
The moment garbage actually collected unpredictable resulting stall pause memory scattered throughout session
Unpredictable stall unacceptable interactive program
Incremental concurrent garbage collector address problem varying
The modern GC implementation try minimize blocking stall much work possible background
separate thread example marking unreachable garbage instance application process continues run
In spite advancement example still difficult maintain large heap million object resident object get promoted older generation without incurring noticeable delay sometimes second
GC incompatible based management resource
As result need explicit manual resource management resource becomes transitive composition
That GC system resource object requires manual resource management object used part another object composed object also become object requires manual resource management
common type garbage collection much garbage collection often refers tracing garbage collection rather method
The overall strategy consists determining object garbage collected tracing object chain reference certain root object considering rest garbage collecting
However large number algorithm used implementation widely varying complexity performance characteristic
Reference counting garbage collection object count number reference
Garbage identified reference count zero
An object reference count incremented reference created decremented reference destroyed
When count reach zero object memory reclaimed
As manual memory management unlike tracing garbage collection reference counting guarantee object destroyed soon last reference destroyed usually access memory either CPU cache object freed directly pointed thus tends significant negative side effect CPU cache virtual memory operation
There number disadvantage reference counting generally solved mitigated sophisticated algorithm used convert thus reducing amount work needed done garbage collector
This done using analysis determine whether object allocated within function accessible outside
escape function thread
In case object may allocated directly thread stack released function return reducing potential garbage collection overhead
Generally speaking likely garbage collection standard feature
In language built garbage collection added library C
Most garbage collection built
especially notable first first language introduce garbage collection
Other dynamic language version use reference counting also tend use GC
language usually provide integrated garbage collection
Notable exception
Historically language intended beginner often used garbage collection data type string list burden programmer manual memory management
On early microcomputer limited memory slow processor BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random inexplicable pause midst program operation
Some BASIC interpreter Apple II family repeatedly scanned string descriptor string highest address order compact toward high memory resulting performance could introduce pause execution program
A replacement garbage collector Applesoft BASIC published January page identified group string every pas heap cut collection time dramatically
released provided windowing garbage collector BASIC reduced collection fraction second
While traditionally garbage collection release introduced garbage collection using developed runtime collector
However release garbage collection deprecated favor ARC introduced
Furthermore since May Apple even forbids usage garbage collection new OS X application
For garbage collection never introduced due problem application responsivity performance instead iOS us ARC
Garbage collection rarely used system perceived need tight control use limited resource
However garbage collector compatible limited environment developed
The Microsoft embedded software platform like larger cousin include garbage collection
form allowing memory reused reclaimed based invariant known compilation
This form garbage collection studied saw greater usage introduction ARC Apple ecosystem iOS OS X
Incremental concurrent garbage collector developed algorithm algorithm
In Baker algorithm allocation done either half single region memory
When becomes half full garbage collection performed move live object half remaining object implicitly deallocated
The running program check object reference correct half move across background task finding object
scheme based empirical observation object die young
In generational garbage collection two allocation region generation kept kept separate based object age
New object created young generation regularly collected generation full object still referenced older region copied next oldest generation
Occasionally full scan performed
Some include hardware support garbage collection
Most implementation garbage collector
Such garbage collector meet constraint used operating system

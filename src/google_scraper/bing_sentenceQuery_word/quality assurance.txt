In forensic science quality evidence important evidence submitted court guilty may go unpunished equally innocent person may lose liberty
The term quality control QC quality assurance QA often used interchangeably

A disorganized laboratory clear chain command reasonably said providing good QA
In article term used cover aspect quality forensic investigation
The idea quality began medieval craftsman organized guild dedicated making product high standard
Products reached quality standard inspecting committee would receive special quality mark
Master craftsman began add quality mark product guard reputation standard
Customers bought product bearing inspection master craftsman mark assured quality purchase
It twentieth century concept quality broadened include many product service including forensic science
The medieval quality mark evolved general idea standard procedure metric measurement behavior whatever needed particular activity guarantee quality output
Standards vary place place need kind international reference

way preventing mistake defect manufactured product avoiding problem delivering solution service customer defines part focused providing confidence quality requirement fulfilled
This defect prevention quality assurance differs subtly defect detection rejection referred focus quality earlier process
The term quality assurance quality control often used interchangeably refer way ensuring quality service product
For instance term assurance often used follows The term control however used describe fifth phase DMAIC model
DMAIC quality strategy used process
Quality assurance comprises administrative procedural activity implemented requirement goal product service activity fulfilled
It systematic measurement comparison standard monitoring process associated feedback loop confers error prevention
This contrasted focused process output
Quality assurance includes two principle Fit purpose product suitable intended purpose right first time mistake eliminated
QA includes management raw material assembly product component service related production production process
The two principle also manifest background developing engineering novel technical product The task engineering make work task quality assurance make work time
Historically defining suitable product service quality mean difficult process determined many way subjective approach contains different weight individual normally attach quality characteristic approach find consumer linking quality price making overall conclusion quality based relationship
During adopted responsibility quality good service offered member setting maintaining certain standard guild membership
Royal government purchasing material interested customer
For reason King appointed William de Wrotham report construction repair ship
Centuries later Secretary British appointed multiple overseer standardize sea ration naval training
Prior extensive resulting possible worker control quality product
The Industrial Revolution led system large group people performing specialized type work grouped together supervision foreman appointed control quality work manufactured
During time manufacturing process typically became complex larger number worker supervised
This period saw widespread introduction created problem workman could earn money production extra turn occasionally led poor quality workmanship passed
Pioneers Frederick Winslow Taylor Henry Ford recognized limitation method used mass production time subsequent varying quality output
Taylor utilizing concept scientific management helped separate production task many simple step assembly line limited quality control specific individual limiting complexity
Ford emphasized standardization design component standard ensure standard product produced quality responsibility machine inspector placed department cover operation frequent interval faulty operation shall proceed great length time

A valuable process perform whole product failure testing
In mechanical term operation product fails often stress increasing
This expose many unanticipated product data used drive engineering manufacturing process improvement
Often quite simple change dramatically improve product service changing adding placement new assembly personnel
Statistical control based analysis objective subjective data
Many organization use tool quality improvement effort track quality data

The quality product dependent upon participating constituent sustainable effectively controlled others
The process e managed QA pertain
If specification reflect true quality requirement product quality guaranteed
For instance parameter pressure vessel cover material operating environmental requirement

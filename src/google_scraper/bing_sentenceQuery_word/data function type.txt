In simply classification data tell programmer intends use data
Most programming language support various type data example
A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory
The type system us data type information check access manipulate data
Most data type statistic comparable type computer programming vice versa shown following table identified five definition type literature
Types including behavior align closely model whereas model would tend include code called
The five type The definition term representation often done imperative language definition term value space behaviour used language
typically type basic language implementation
All data computer based digital electronics represented alternative lowest level
The smallest addressable unit data usually group bit called usually bit
The unit processed instruction called typically bit
Most instruction interpret word word represent unsigned integer value signed integer value
Because machine language machine need distinguish unsigned signed data type part
There specific set arithmetic instruction use different interpretation bit word number
Machine data type need made available allowing control hardware
The instance supply integer type various width
If corresponding native type exist target platform compiler break code using type exist
For instance integer requested bit platform compiler tacitly treat array two bit integer
Several language allow convenient manipulation machine data
In higher level programming machine data type often hidden implementation detail would render code le portable exposed
For instance generic type might supplied instead integer specific
The represents value
Although two value possible rarely implemented single binary digit efficiency reason
Many programming language explicit Boolean type instead interpreting instance false value true
Boolean data simply refers logical structure language interpreted machine language
In case Boolean refers logic False
True always non zero especially one known Boolean
Such derived one primitive type
This done number way
The way combined called
Composing primitive type compound type generally result new type
different type
Many others possible tend variation compound
The distinct value compared assigned necessarily particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four suit deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Some implementation allow programmer assign integer value enumeration value even treat integer
Such Character string type store sequence character character set
Since character set include possible numeric string
However many language treat belonging different type numeric value
Character string type different subtypes according required character width
The original wide ASCII found limited superseded set encode wide variety alphabet symbol
Strings may either fixed size even programming language
They may also subtyped maximum size
Note string primitive language instance C may composed array character
Types based derived basic type explained
In language C type derived type
The main derived type data type whose value refers directly point another value stored elsewhere using
It primitive kind
In everyday term page number book could considered piece data refers another one
Pointers often stored format similar integer however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To ameliorate potential problem pointer considered separate type type data point even underlying representation
Any type specify implementation
For instance abstract type implemented array contiguous block memory containing multiple value set memory block linked
Abstract type handled code know care underlying type contained
Programming agnostic concrete data type called
Arrays record also contain underlying type considered concrete specify content element laid memory
Examples include For convenience language may supply real world data type instance even language allows built primitive type
A associate type computed value
By examining flow value type system attempt prove occur
The type system question determines constitutes type error type system generally seek guarantee operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense
A may use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler data type example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Type system may variously forth

Computer program use data type organise different type data program

As begin writing real code one first thing must familiarize variable close cousin constant
A variable according name something allows value vary
In programming use variable store data run program
A variable contrasted constant whose value allowed change
In programming use constant store information know never going change
Even though variable constant may sound different semantically reality quite similar
We start studying constant look variable variable easier understand understood constant
My name Erik I think fair say constant never ever change
The absolute zero temperature also constant never change either
The number second one hour constant well never change always second hour
A constant purpose computer programming consists two thing name value
The name clearly illustrate constant le
The value actual value constant example absolute zero number second hour
In programming book name constant uppercase letter
This allows u clearly identify constant soon run code thus able distinguish variable written using lower case letter
A constant created using const reserved word followed constant data type followed constant name finally followed sign value
Let create constant see look like
What would appropriate name constant example
Names variable constant always programmer suggestion For worry meaning int uint
They data type explain later
When picking name constant variable want expressive order reduce risk ambiguity also absolutely fine use abbreviation long name take whole screen
For example NBR nbr common abbreviation number one see lot
There another rule pick name name must consist alphanumerical character
well underscore
You use underscore separate word become legible
In programming term initialize two constant
When initialize constant variable two thing Constants useful want set value repeat many location inside program
If use constant rather wrote several different location program wherever wanted refer absolute zero ever wanted change different number would change multiple location rather one
According Murphy law saying anything go wrong go wrong
This usually recipe disaster often even forgot change one value could lead strange error run program
By declaring constant allows u easily change value constant time run program change code one location opposed many reduces risk introducing error code
Variables similar constant main difference constant change assigned value variable oftentimes
We define variable similar fashion define constant instead using reserved word const use var
Let introduce concept called declaration
Declaration thought initialization without giving variable value
When declare variable simply inform computer intention use variable program computer allocate memory
Sometimes may prefer give variable value immediately language typically older language actually forced declare variable beginning code regardless code intend use
In modern language best practice indicate preferable declare initialize variable close possible first use concept declaration significant anymore used
Still educational purpose let declare variable designed store current temperature That variable available use code change value many time like
In fact variable value often changed many time program sometimes even million time
Let say programming teacher asked write program simulates rolling dice time end sum roll present number screen
Your teacher instructed keep track progress using variable
How many variable might need
In case would need one variable keep track sum one keep track many time rolled dice
We might therefore start initializing variable start program yet rolled dice hence sum Remember initialize variable declare give type name well give value
We would also initialize variable yet rolled dice
Each time program roll dice would add number displayed dice variable
After first dice roll might second might third might etc
The point always keep track total sum roll name indicates
Also time rolled dice would increment stop running program reached
It noted program stop running variable constant respective value lost
That typically program print information screen otherwise output save result run program preserve result
Just like may able describe word English certain type personal name number etc variable constant computer programming language
For example English might classified number whereas Steve Elon Larry Mark might classified name
Computers use similar type require bit granularity
We therefore familiarize two common data type programming integer string
Integers simply number without decimal
Integer variable take negative positive value referred signed integer
Signed refers fact minus sign front
Integer variable take positive value referred unsigned integer
When initialized wrote We picked unsigned integer type written uint know dice roll sum never negative
The reason picking unsigned integer choose roll dice many many time unsigned integer contain twice large number signed integer
The explanation simple signed integer unsigned integer allocated space memory signed integer however half capacity minus sign half unsigned integer capacity minus sign
Whether declare integer variable signed unsigned depend circumstance although time probably end using signed integer give flexibility
When learning programming theory however dealing large number worth noting difference signed unsigned integer
In example must use signed integer written int since must allow negative cash flow
We initialize signed integer variable following way The bit smallest unit information stored computer memory
A bit take one two value
An integer variable stored memory using one bit typically bit modern computer
The bit allocated integer higher largest value
The general formula many value integer take n equal number bit
This mean integer take two different value integer take four different value integer take value etc
The string second data type get know
Strings programming basically said equal text plain English
Here example string note use keyword string indicate declaring string All variable string variable set equal text surrounded quote
The quote fact one requirement string
Without quote would string
Whether use double quote single quote considered equivalent purpose book Pete equivalent Pete
We know properly refer left sign learned called either variable constant
This begs obvious question far right sign
The answer literal
In example say Pete string literal integer literal
A literal anything written directly code example text number
Literals show many location code right sign
Both integer string would somewhat uninteresting perform operation
By operation point referring arithmetic integer
adding subtracting dividing multiplying string concatenation string
joining two string together
A example operation performed integer follow We start initializing two unsigned integer data type uint number minus sign front
We purchase ice cream reduce accordingly
Note simply applying basic algebra
Our variable value
Let say get lucky find street proceed donate half wallet charity Our variable value
Let turn attention string operation
In section discus concatenation
Concatenation act combining two string
For example concatenated two string Programming class would end Programming class
Here concatenate two string value Erik Linde

In traditionally either kind variable
The latter may allow element mutated length changed may fixed creation
A string generally understood often implemented store sequence element typically character using
A string may also denote general sequence data type structure
Depending programming language precise data type used declared string may either cause storage memory statically allocated predetermined maximum length employ allow hold variable number element
When string appears literally known anonymous string
In used string finite sequence chosen called
Let Σ symbol alternatively called character called
No assumption made nature symbol
A Σ finite symbol Σ
For example Σ string Σ
The string number symbol length sequence often denoted
The unique string Σ length denoted
The set string Σ length denoted Σ
For example Σ Σ
Note Σ ε alphabet Σ
The set string Σ length Σ denoted Σ
In term Σ For example Σ Σ ε
Although set Σ element Σ string finite length
A set string Σ
Σ called Σ
For example Σ set string even number zero ε formal language important Σ
For two string Σ concatenation defined sequence symbol followed sequence character denoted
For example Σ b z
String concatenation operation
The empty string ε serf string ε ε
Therefore set Σ concatenation operation form generated Σ
In addition length function defines Σ integer function
A string said exist possibly empty string
The substring defines Σ empty string
A string said exists string
If nonempty said prefix
Symmetrically string said exists string
If nonempty said suffix
Suffixes prefix substring
Both relation prefix suffix
A string said rotation
For example Σ string rotation u v
The reverse string string symbol reverse order
For example abc b c symbol alphabet reverse cba
A string reverse madam called also includes empty string string length
It often useful define set string
If alphabet Σ cf
one define total order Σ called
For example Σ lexicographical order Σ includes relationship ε
The lexicographical order alphabetical order nontrivial alphabet even alphabetical order

A datatype modeled idea formal string
Strings important useful datatype implemented nearly every
In language available others
The programming language allows string usually quoted way represent instance string datatype called
Although formal string arbitrary finite length length string real language often constrained artificial maximum
In general two type string datatypes fixed maximum length determined compile time use amount memory whether maximum needed whose length arbitrarily fixed use varying amount memory depending actual requirement
Most string modern string
Of course even string limited length number bit available pointer size available
The string length stored separate integer may put artificial limit length implicitly termination character usually character value bit zero

String datatypes historically allocated one byte per character although exact character set varied region character encoding similar enough programmer could often get away ignoring since character program treated specially period space comma place encoding program would encounter
These character set typically based
If text one encoding displayed system using different encoding text often though often somewhat readable computer user learned read mangled text
language known collectively need far character limit one byte encoding reasonable representation
The normal solution involved keeping representation ASCII using representation CJK
Use existing code led problem matching cutting string severity depended character encoding designed
Some encoding family guarantee byte value ASCII range represent ASCII character making encoding safe system use character field separator
Other encoding make guarantee making matching byte code unsafe
These encoding also locating character boundary required backing start string pasting two string together could result corruption second string
simplified picture somewhat
Most programming language datatype Unicode string
Unicode preferred byte stream format designed problem described older multibyte encoding
require programmer know code unit different character main difficulty currently incorrectly designed APIs attempt hide difference make character due composing code
Some language like implement string used datatype exception rule
Some language normally allow content string changed created termed string
In language value fixed new string must created alteration made termed string
Strings typically implemented byte character code unit order allow fast access individual unit character fixed length
A language implement instead
Some language avoid implementing dedicated string datatype instead adopting convention representing string list character code
Representations string depend heavily choice character repertoire method character encoding
Older string implementation designed work repertoire encoding defined ASCII recent extension like series
Modern implementation often use extensive repertoire defined Unicode along variety complex encoding
The term usually indicates string byte rather string readable character string bit
Byte string often imply byte take value data stored meaning value interpreted termination value
Most string implementation similar entry storing corresponding character
The principal difference certain encoding single logical character may take one entry array
This happens example single code code point take anywhere one four byte single character take arbitrary number code
In case logical length string number character differs physical length array number byte use
avoids first part problem
The length string stored implicitly using special terminating character often NUL bit zero convention used perpetuated popular
Hence representation commonly referred
This representation string take space terminator thus
In terminated string terminating code allowable character string
Strings field limitation also store arbitrary
An example stored along modern representation The length string example character occupies byte
Characters terminator form part representation may either part data garbage
Strings form sometimes called original directive used declare
Using special byte null terminating string historically appeared hardware software though sometimes value also printing character
used many assembler system used system character value zero used since string delimiter BASIC language
Somewhat similar data processing machine like used special bit delimit string left operation would start right
This bit clear part string
This meant IBM word almost ever thought use feature override assignment seventh bit example handle ASCII code
Early microcomputer software relied upon fact ASCII code use bit set indicate end string
It must reset prior output
The length string also stored explicitly example prefixing string length byte value convention used many dialect consequence people call string
Storing string length byte limit maximum string length
To avoid limitation improved implementation use store string length
When field cover string limited
If length bounded encoded constant space typically machine word thus leading taking space number character word ASCII machine machine etc
If length bounded encoding length take log space see string encoding string length log space
In latter case field fixed length therefore actual string data need moved string grows length field need increased
Here Pascal string stored buffer along ASCII representation Many language including one implement string internal structure like However since implementation usually string must accessed modified member function
pointer dynamically allocated memory area might expanded needed

Both character termination length code limit string For example C character array contain null NUL character handled directly C string library function Strings using length code limited maximum value length code
Both limitation overcome clever programming

While representation common others possible
Using make certain string operation insertion deletion concatenation efficient
The core data structure one manages string sequence character represents current state file edited
While state could stored single long consecutive array character typical text editor instead us alternative representation sequence data line make certain string operation insertion deletion undoing previous edits efficient
The differing memory layout storage requirement string affect security program accessing string data
String representation requiring terminating character commonly susceptible problem terminating character present caused coding error deliberately altering data
String representation adopting separate length field also susceptible length manipulated
In case program code accessing string data requires ensure inadvertently access change data outside string memory limit
String data frequently obtained program
As responsibility program validate string ensure represents expected format
Performing limited validation cause program vulnerable attack
Sometimes string need embedded inside text file intended consumption machine
This needed example source code programming language configuration file
In case NUL character work well terminator since normally invisible difficult input via keyboard
Storing string length would also inconvenient manual computation tracking length tedious
Two common representation While character string common us string string computer science may refer generically sequence homogeneously typed data

Whenever must manipulated change require creation new turn involves creation new array character copying original array
This happens even original value intermediate used manipulation kept
Java provides two alternate class string manipulation called
Both like array hold character
They however mutable state altered
Their array character necessarily completely filled opposed String whose array always exact required length content
Thus capability add remove change state without creating new object without creation new array array copying
The exception array longer suitable length hold content case rarely happens default Dynamic memory allocation provided JVM
In case required create new array copy content
For reason Java would handle expression like like Generally String string handling
However necessarily case since StringBuffer required recreate character array run space
Theoretically possible happen number time new String would required although unlikely programmer provide length hint prevent
Either way effect noticeable modern desktop computer
As well shortcoming array inherent
In order insert remove character arbitrary position whole section array must moved
The method attractive environment low processing power take ability using much memory likely also premium environment
This point however trivial considering space required creating many instance Strings order process

Categories Subject Descriptors Computer Information Science Education Academia computing technology changing rapidly
Public support university traditional balance research teaching come increased scrutiny criticism
At time modern society grows ever dependent computing technology many sector science industry anticipate ongoing shortage computer scientist engineer
The distance foundation computing research application frontier considerably shorter many field
As result curriculum computer science engineering CS E face constant evolutionary pressure integrate new critical development
The rapid change technology however also affect process educational delivery
Recent advance networking graphic example make possible develop effective pedagogical tool shared among many different educational institution
CS E educator must play key role responding change
To remain effective CS E education must evolve method content discipline progress
Educators need champion new technology increase quality education provide opportunity wider class student prepare graduate participate development technology ensure safety privacy empowerment competency future citizen
Meeting challenge require fundamental change way faculty represent principle practice CS E educational level
Education computer science engineering active area throughout much history discipline
Particularly since establishment first computer science department mid considerable attention paid challenge training student rapidly evolving field
In ACM published extensive report computer science curriculum entitled
That report subsequently updated two report issued approximately interval
The IEEE Computer Society published independent curriculum computer science engineering subsequently collaborated ACM report
In addition various organization issued several additional report covering issue computer science liberal art college structure introductory course standard accreditation secondary school curriculum
Each year since ACM Special Interest Group Computer Science Education SIGCSE held symposium attracts increasingly larger audience year
Computer science education also proved lively topic discussion well computing forum
One important strength computer science education community willingness experiment diverse model education
This diversity easily recognized design introductory curriculum successful course designed using following model addition traditional one emphasizes problem solving programming Experimentation development occurs level curriculum well
The Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon University example developed entire undergraduate curriculum software engineering
Faculty many institution also created program serve model computer science education school
Overall continuing importance education strategic area computer science engineering CS E research reaffirmed report appearance distinct subject area SDCR Workshop
The topic education computer science engineering large consider
To make topic manageable working group chose distinguish following five area These area considered individually following subsection
Computer science remains rapidly evolving discipline place considerable pressure CS E curriculum
The emergence new tool technique paradigm force continual reevaluation topic covered pedagogical approach used
Maintaining curriculum particularly difficult institution pace change discipline fast
As result CS E curriculum quickly becomes outdated technology advance
One indication obsolescence curriculum fact many important topic yet find niche core curriculum offered many institution
Examples topic include paradigm problem solving parallelism network interaction software design software safety social impact technology
One way address lack attention paid issue would update knowledge unit incorporate contemporary core topic theme eliminating concept become outdated
Given curriculum report traditionally published every decade critical establish responsive process would allow integration new principle artifact soon emerge
A similar process continually identifying eliminating obsolescent topic core curriculum also needed
Because rapid pace change discipline imperative computer science institution develop better mechanism sharing educational resource
There far much reinvention little synergy throughout educational community
For example proliferation text waste time creates many result
We need develop new mechanism successful course material widely economically shared
As possible starting point SIGCSE Web page NSF Computer Science Courseware repository contain link information variety course material available different institution
Some recent textbook similarly advised instructor download supporting software laboratory material use course
Although Web provides underlying technology sharing resource system would effective without level centralized support
If institution simply publishes material independently easy way others find right material vastness Web assurance quality
To create effective repository someone likely group agency must take role reviewer filter material manageable collection ensure quality maintained
Different institution different educational priority constituency must therefore shape program accordingly
Some driven industry need others driven general goal liberal art science education
Because difference common model applies institution
Despite difference nonetheless several problem affect wide range institution offering undergraduate program computer science
These problem identified following paragraph
The relationship education research must reexamined college university faculty well entire profession
New interaction research education industry needed student faculty computing practitioner maximize utility education throughout broad range intellectual practical interest serf
Standards promotion tenure must change make teaching exciting activity faculty alongside research consulting
To end institution must find way recognize value faculty effort toward pedagogical curriculum innovation especially broad impact institution
Because computer science change rapidly
Depending institution individual might mean conducting research traditional area developing new course teaching material based recent progress discipline conducting research nontraditional area curriculum teaching methodology
Institutions strongly emphasize teaching must moderate teaching load increase real support scholarly activity
Opportunities continued faculty development provided short course tutorial would available conference summer workshop
Internships industry university setting also available faculty institution remain current
Undergraduate course design take account requirement industry maintaining commitment sound pedagogical practice
The introductory course emphasize fundamental principle discipline advanced course often application strong theme
The breadth discipline taught early curriculum expense solid introduction programming incorporates problem solving software engineering design
design empowering essential experience undergraduate
A design course capstone research experience required undergraduate major
Such course aim give student experience solving significant problem confronting contemporary research issue
Examples include discussion semantics programming language verification issue software engineering theory issue database unsolvability algorithm
Faculties also look opportunity repackage traditional subject discipline including theoretical concept present new engaging way
Lab exercise textbook example reflect broadest range student concern contemporary life experience
Lectures alone without student interaction small group laboratory inadequate learning mechanism CS E education
While professional training already important mission community college many undergraduate program also provide practical course evening student appropriate individual mission need local community
Because student come CS E wide range learning style background We must view change pedagogy opportunistically view change research specialty
CS E educator slow take advantage new method teaching many current method ideally suited encouraging new student interest field
For instance interdisciplinary major program involving natural science economics psychology developed within setting concentration computer science
Some early progress sort made area computational science
At many institution first course serve interest mixed audience major nonmajors
The interest nonmajors field CS E increasingly strong sophisticated
These interest ought recognized development new course material effective teaching strategy
Priorities Master granting institution varied undergraduate program
Although graduate department change curriculum course nature granting institution requires faculty stay abreast recent trend field order productive researcher move forward tenure promotion
At time climate institution graduate program changing
Government funding level research significantly decreased indication suggest reduction occur
Universities may need develop closer tie industry maintain appropriate level research funding future
These change may engender change educational research mission CS E graduate program
Thus CS E graduate program face several unique challenge identified paragraph
The recent Taulbee Survey indicates roughly new employed industry government rather academia
At time number position available CS E department decreased remained constant since
In era fiscal retrenchment university level reasonable expect proportion employed academia decline
As academic department develop closer tie industry may affect course offering curriculum
However many hired industry ability see difficult project completion much expertise subject area
Thus although closer tie industry see graduate education continuing source strength department although funding may come different source
yet prepared particular balance academic priority department value
Many university graduate program beginning put increased emphasis educational initiative source funding undergraduate tuition large portion budget increased pressure student external source
Training teaching coping new job requires planning resource department currently provide
Departments must place new emphasis teaching skill graduate student many faculty
Although number program risen recent year department offering Master degree especially local industry provides demand
In response project Master degree may become common
Some department need consider providing different balance research applied activity research take smaller role program
Professional education thus widely accepted regular part academy
Some graduate program provide course evening student accordance need local community
The audience course would include industry professional educator whose technical knowledge need updated broadened new direction
The following issue apply specifically primary secondary school level computing education although idea may relevance undergraduate curriculum well
In natural science mathematics curriculum relatively well established
We believe important implement similar curriculum computer science identifies great idea computing idea affect world live
It follow idea presented ACM Model High School Curriculum introduces discipline broadly
The current AP curriculum serf narrow purpose satisfy need area
The biggest obstacle teaching computer science secondary school lack teacher appropriate skill training
A substantial effort area needed address problem
Students college exposure computer science need encouraged consider teaching career new program need instituted would offer new teacher appropriate training beginning career
Moreover teacher training must broad enough understand communicate student public CS E encompasses much broader range subject programming
There massive imbalance educational opportunity available student different school system
Students affluent school system many opportunity learn technology counterpart poorer district
Moreover even within single school system gap educator administrator comfortable technology also wide
A major effort needed bring faculty staff level speed computing technology integrate effectively widest range curricular subject
Activities like ACM undergraduate research award high school programming contest need revitalized
New activity might include starting high computer science problem magazine like one mathematics starting new summer course computer science secondary school teacher
There many computer science education community whose interest represented different organization including following advancement computing education ACM Education Board Computer Science Education Computer Uses Education ACM SIGACT Education Committee ACM Committee Consortium Computing Small Colleges CEEB AP Curriculum Committee Graduate education faculty issue accreditation computing technology higher education IFIP International undergraduate curriculum committee ISTE Computer Science Society technology secondary school education Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium Although community many common interest interact much
At moment member ACM Education Board appointed entirely discretion chair
As result different educational interest directly represented highest level within ACM
We believe ACM Education Board modify charter ensure representation constituency promote higher level interaction among
Such change would create visible representative proactive board could provide leadership ongoing process improving quality computer science education level
The Education Board also seek create new communication channel shared curricular concern effectively discussed
Moreover SIGCSE program committee representative secondary school community including AP graduate school community professional education community alongside undergraduate community
The recent decision switch Pascal programming language AP course excellent example issue better channel interconstituency communication might profoundly beneficial effect
As title make clear one major goal workshop working group identify direction work discipline strategic sense new investment area would provide greatest leverage advancing area whole
In seeking apply criterion computer science education working group concludes important strategic direction promote greater sharing educational resource exploiting power modern computing technology
In sense facilitating reuse curricular development educational software constitutes grand challenge CS E education much way reuse software remains grand challenge software engineering
Our vision develop distributed center tentatively called CS E Education Center would collect promote distribution material relevant computer science education
The service provided CS E Education Center would include following The audience course would include people workplace require continuing education course Java interactive Web software design course programming
It would also include handful student geographically dispersed need course subject curriculum compiler code generation optimization
At moment difficult mount course particular institution due limited local demand
A detailed discussion idea found
A great deal exploratory research needed challenge effectively met
A central question whether CS E Education Center provide adequate meaningful human interaction support educational function
For instance expert need answer student question timely manner well evaluate student work
The need support great public source industry benefit initiative
Some new program National Science Foundation especially EHR Directorate seem supporting exploration like one discussed
The establishment CS E Education Center may emerge exciting complex fundamentally important idea help ensure future vitality meaningful extension computing education next millennium

Methods making class session effective Ways encourage student participation class Advantages collaborative learning Examples effective laboratory practice This chapter discus several method teaching science within traditional format lecture discussion session laboratory
How help student learn science better efficiently format
Although universal best way teach experience show general principle apply American Association Advancement Science McDermott et Mazur Teach scientific way thinking
Actively involve student learning
Help student develop conceptual framework well develop problem solving skill
Promote student discussion group activity
Help student experience science varied interesting enjoyable way
Assess student understanding frequent interval throughout learning process
Evidence number discipline suggests oral presentation large group passive student contribute little real learning
In physic standard lecture help student develop conceptual understanding fundamental process electricity mechanic Arons McDermott Shaffer McDermott et
Similarly student grade large general chemistry lecture course correlate lecturing skill experience instructor Birk Foster
Despite limitation traditional lecture many institution forced offer introductory science course
Many professor teach course feel lecturing option dream could accomplish smaller class
However small growing group science faculty member developed way engage student process thinking questioning problem solving despite large class size
Strategies use introductory course biology geology described sidebar
Although many method described sidebar consistent expert know student learn see may welcomed student class
There several way help student make transition passive listener active participant learning Orzechowksi Start slowly student may much experience active learning
Introduce change beginning course rather midway
Avoid giving student impression experimenting
Biochemistry Genetics Molecular Biology Stanford University Professor Sharon Long Enrollment student One important tool I use engage student create opportunity thought active pursuit unknown class session
If I give lecture I provide common always leave blank critical part note
On board transparency I indicate unknown
I pause I talk drawing student attention hole note
If possible I ask suggested answer vote among possibility
By arranging pause lecture give student chance puzzle question preview ability work question independently
And attending class student gain important draw encourage class attendance
In teaching formal genetics I draw genetic cross first general form example Drosophila eye color inheritance test w x w w Then I put lecture completely blank Punnett square show structure provide answer
The student encounter unknown I address content line box question
Everybody consult neighbor second row anybody tell two blank top
What would genotype phenotype bottom right box
Physical Geology Arizona State University Professor Ramon Arrowsmith Enrollment student I show example geology experience occasionally include funny slide video audio clip lighten thing
I use multimedia presentation system composed vertical camera illuminated table I write place rock example book anything else I want student see
The video signal projected screen classroom
This form presentation worked well definitely improved student access material making thing visible
Along presentation system I use laser disc containing movie photograph textbook publisher
I easily switch multimedia laser disc output thus weave visual example lecture
Occasionally I show student computer file video VHS player
The student react well multimedia approach involve student I short exercise group talk
For I walk side auditorium designate even odd row
Then I say even people turn around face odd people exercise together
This generates group people
They put name onto single sheet turn
Then student work together question minute
I walk around room answering question
When time TA stand overhead projector I walk crowd I lapel mike hear collecting answer question
Then talk solution
Usually time run student turn paper
Of course get credit participation provides motivation I sure student understand concept better presented lecture
This process engages student
Of course grows student move assigned topic conversation come back fairly quickly
It bit unnerving potential loss control class student seem either like indifferent certainly quite passive lectured
Do give lecture completely
Anticipate student anxiety prepared provide support encouragement adapt expectation
Discuss approach colleague especially teaching course curriculum
When lecturing chosen necessary teaching method one way keep student engaged pause periodically ass student understanding initiate short student discussion see sidebar
Calling individual student answer question offer comment also hold student attention however student prefer feedback method anonymity
If opportunity discus question small group group offer answer remove one student spotlight
Another option student write answer index card pas card end row student seated select one answer present without disclosing whose
The literature teaching learning contains example technique maintain student attention lecture setting Eble Davis Lowman McKeachie Avoid direct repetition material textbook remains useful alternative resource
Use paradox puzzle apparent contradiction engage student
Make connection current event everyday phenomenon
Begin class something familiar important student
End class summarizing main point made
Adopt reasonable adjustable pace balance content coverage student understanding
Consider using slide video film computer simulation enhance presentation remember Students take note darkened room
The text need large enough read back room
Students need time summarize observation draw note conclusion
Pay attention delivery Maintain eye contact student part room
Step behind lecture bench feasible
Move around much distracting
Talk student blackboard
If using board avoid blocking AV projector screen
Shift mood intensity
Vary presentation technique
At beginning course discus student several strategy effectively engaging learning class
Some may listen others take note still others may try transcribe word
Some student may want tape class session
If want encourage particular form student participation make clear expectation reason student learning benefit
Whether lecture discussion section laboratory individual encounter questioning important part guiding student learning
When student ask question often seeking shortcut learning process getting right answer authority figure
However process arriving answer assessing validity answer usually important particularly student apply process next question
Both process obscured teacher simply give requested answer
Often Socratic student question another perhaps leading student often frustrating offer possible answer supporting reason assessment
In fact posing question effective teaching technique
Here tip effective use question Wait long enough indicate expect student think answering
Some student know silent professor give answer Rowe
Solicit answer volunteer selected student
Determine student confidence level listen answer
Solicit alternative answer elaboration provide material comparison contrast assessment
Solicit additional response student leading question observation
Direct ensuing discussion comparison evaluation extension offered answer rather simple validation refutation right wrong answer
Pose second question continue exploration
Biochemistry Genetics Molecular Biology Stanford University Professor Sharon Long Enrollment student Even demonstration work large class us everyday object student recognize especially something student find use
My favorite example use telephone cord demonstrate supercoiling DNA
The phone cord intrinsic helicity DNA though usually phone cord left handed whereas DNA often discussed right handed B form
Who experience coiled headset cord telephone show supercoils twist around
This present student chance play home convince direction handedness supercoils depends direction original helix whether cord underwound overwound headset replaced constraining end
Students learn important principle understanding nucleic acid handy practical tip let predict easiest way get kink phone cord
They get chance test understanding making prediction one hope active scientific learning
A professor question build confidence rather induce fear
One technique encourage student propose several different answer question
The student encouraged step outside answer begin develop skill necessary ass answer
Some question seek fact simply measure student recall others demand higher reasoning skill elaborating explaining concept comparing contrasting several possibility speculating outcome speculating cause effect
The type question asked response given student initial answer crucial type reasoning process student encouraged use
Several aspect question formulate reasoning knowledge tested encouraged deal dialogue testing
Chapters contain information question part assessment testing grading
Demonstrations effective illustrating concept class result passive learning without careful attention engaging student
They provoke student think especially helpful demonstration surprise challenge assumption illustrates otherwise abstract concept mechanism
Demonstrations use everyday object especially effective require little preparation part faculty see sidebar
Students interest peaked asked make prediction vote probable outcome
There numerous resource available help faculty design conduct demonstration
Many science education periodical contain one demonstration issue
The Demonstrations column Favorite Demonstration column two many example
The American Chemical Society University Wisconsin Press published excellent book chemical demonstration Shakhashiri Summerlin Ealy Summerlin et
Similar volume physic demonstration published American Association Physics Teachers Freier Anderson Berry
You consider number issue planning demonstration What concept want demonstration illustrate
Which many demonstration selected topic generate greatest enhancement student learning
Where class would effective
What prior knowledge reviewed demonstration
What design would effective given material hand target audience
Which step demonstration procedure carried ahead time
What question appropriate motivate direct student observation thought process demonstration
What question used test stretch student understanding new concept
If classroom lecture hall large consider whether student back able see demonstration
Look videotaping demonstration projecting image larger screen student see
Small group discussion section often used course complement lecture
In course small enrollment substitute lecture lecture discussion format used class period
The main distinction lecture discussion level student participation expected whole continuum exists
Discussions student answer instructor question student address one another instructor mainly guide discussion toward important point
In case discussion session productive student expected prepare advance
Focused discussion effective way many student develop conceptual framework learn problem solving skill try idea student instructor
The give take technical discussion also sharpens critical quantitative thinking skill
Classes student must participate discussion force go beyond merely plugging number formula memorizing term
They must learn explain word thinking
Students motivated prepare class expected participate actively
However discussion le predictable presentation time consuming require skill teacher
To lead effective discussion teacher must good facilitator ensuring key point covered monitoring group dynamic
Guidance needed keep discussion becoming disorganized irrelevant
Some student like may function effectively class much time devoted student discussion
Some may take point view paid hear expert teacher
For student useful review benefit format contrast lecture whose purpose transmit information
Sensitivity personality cultural linguistic gender difference may affect student participation discussion also important especially participation graded
When student spontaneously engage discussion may unprepared may reluctant speak assertive
Some may comfortable making comparison absolute statement others may comfortable narrative description quantitative analysis
You might try various strategy engage student meaningful discussion posing question measure different level understanding knowledge application analysis comprehension see
Probably best overall advice bold flexible willing adjust strategy fit character class
If want experiment using discussion class thing consider Decide goal class discussion
What want student get class session
Concepts
Problem solving skill
skill
The ability make connection discipline technology
Broader perspective
Keep mind goal may change progress material quarter semester
Explain student discussion structured
Will discussion involve whole class student work smaller group
Make clear expect coming class session read chapter think question end chapter seriously try first five problem etc
Let student see take attendance
Students come class may studying
If want student discus question concept small group explain student group form
Do allow student dominate discussion
Some student naturally respond quickly must encouraged let others chance
Be sure student participate acceptable level
In extreme case may speak outside class aggressive excessively reticent student
Look opportunity student bring class illustrating important point day topic
This effective way stimulate discussion
Be willing adjust need student take advantage strength teacher
Watch sign student need le guidance
Are main point coming getting resolved
Do need summarizing moderating
Collaborative learning umbrella term variety educational approach involving joint intellectual effort student student teacher together Goodsell et
Cooperative learning form collaborative learning instructional technique student work group achieve common goal contribute individually accountable way Stover et
The interaction take different form study group discussion group project group class group role leader timekeeper technician spokesperson forth assigned rotated Although cooperative learning used effectively elementary middle high school number year discussed Johnson Johnson Slavin study done demonstrate effectiveness college classroom
Nevertheless growing number practitioner assessing effectiveness Treisman Fullilove Johnson et Smith et Caprio Posner Markstein Cooper Watson Marshall
While many advocate collaborative learning quick point advantage also sensitive perceived problem
Cooper example point coverage lack control class student carry weight group need considered embarking collaborative learning
In addition evaluation group work requires careful consideration see
It hard imagine learning science learning science without laboratory field work
Experimentation underlies scientific knowledge understanding
Laboratories wonderful setting teaching learning science
They provide student opportunity think discus solve real problem
Developing teaching effective laboratory requires much skill creativity hard work proposing executing research project
Despite importance experimentation science introductory lab fail convey excitement discovery majority student
They generally give introductory science lab low mark often describing boring waste time
What wrong
It clear many introductory laboratory program suffering neglect
Typically student work way list instruction trying reproduce expected result wondering get right answer
While approach little science common practice efficient
Laboratories costly time consuming predictable cookbook lab allow department offer lab course large number student
Improving undergraduate laboratory instruction become priority many institution driven part exciting program developed wide range institution
Some lab encourage critical quantitative thinking emphasize demonstration principle development lab technique help student deepen understanding fundamental concept Hake
Where possible lab coincident lecture discussion
Before begin develop laboratory program important think goal
Here number possibility Develop intuition deepen understanding concept
Apply concept learned class new situation
Experience basic phenomenon
Develop critical quantitative thinking
Develop experimental data analysis skill
Learn use scientific apparatus
Learn estimate statistical error recognize systematic error
Develop reporting skill written oral
Practice collaborative problem solving
Exercise curiosity creativity designing procedure test hypothesis
Better appreciate role experimentation science
Test important law rule
Developing effective laboratory requires appropriate space equipment extraordinary effort department creative teacher
Still invested innovative introductory laboratory program report encouraging result better understanding material much positive student attitude toward lab faculty participation lab Wilson
Many science department implemented innovative laboratory program introductory course
We encourage consult organization publication listed Appendices
Education session professional society meeting another opportunity get good idea lab discipline
Some faculty member given lecturing large Animal Behavior Laboratory Princeton University Professor James Gould Enrollment approximately student section A major goal course teach student science collect initial observation formulate testable hypothesis perform test refine overhaul original hypothesis devise new test
Each lab two week long equipment animal available entire time
All material student could plausibly need stored shelf easy immediate access
In first hour discus lab possible hypothesis look material hand
Each group formulates initial plan obtains approval plan conduct experiment
The flexible lab utilize stimulus
In one lab student asked determine feature prey toad responds
Although begin live cricket worm encouraged use computer library virtual cricket toad
Students given instruction making new prey model modifying existing one test toad response different feature
The library includes variation shape motion color size plus variety cricket chirp call
In general student quickly discover virtual cricket work almost well real provide data since toad never fill
A simple statistical program computer help minimize drudgery data analysis enabling student concentrate experimental design result rather tedious computation
A number lab course make use modified stimulus
Labs using strategy deal mate recognition cricket fish competitor recognition fish predator recognition chick fish imprinting duckling color change lizard hemispheric dominance human
Cooperative Learning Laboratory Students two laboratory section chemistry course nonscience major worked group three two experiment acid base buffer
The experiment devised using modified jigsaw technique student group assigned particular part lesson unit responsible helping member group learn material
The week prior laboratory student given list objective preparatory work divided three part
Students decided divide responsibility preparatory laboratory task informed score exam would averaged member group would receive grade
Two control section laboratory conducted traditional manner student working independently
All four group student part lecture class significant difference age gender balance previous number chemistry class
Although control section overall GPA higher cooperative learning section versus student cooperative section higher overall score test
The author conclude use cooperative learning laboratory positive effect student achievement
Smith et class meeting favor supervised collaborative learning laboratory setting
Such workshop method devised teaching physic Laws chemistry Lisensky et mathematics
Although feasible many institution idea developed course translate reasonably well course lab associated course Thornton press
Laboratories enriched computer make data acquisition analysis easier much faster thus allowing student think result improved experiment
Computers also used element experiment simulate response vary stimulus
Computers offer convenience flexibility safety laboratory completely replace student interaction natural world
Laboratory teaching method vary widely certainly substitute instructor circulating among student answering asking question pointing subtle detail possible application generally guiding student learning
Although student work informally pair group many lab faculty formally introduced cooperative learning lab see sidebar
Some instructor rely lab handout give cookbook instruction pose carefully constructed sequence question help student design experiment illustrate important concept Hake
One advantage handout designer closely control student lab Moog Farrell
The challenge design student must think creative
In unstructured lab challenge prevent student getting stranded discouraged
Easy access faculty member teaching assistant essential type lab
Once decided goal laboratory familiar innovative idea field ready ask following question How others operated program
Seek colleague department institution may implemented laboratory program similar one considering learn experience
How much time energy willing invest
Buying new equipment tinkering lab probably improve lab much required implement substantial change
Changing way student learn involves rethinking way lab taught writing new lab handout setting training program teaching assistant perhaps designing new experiment
What support
Solicit interest support departmental colleague teaching assistant
Are departmental institutional administration supportive project willing accept risk
Determine likely provide needed resource
Are prepared go still get mediocre student evaluation
Helping Teaching Assistants Teach Laboratory All teaching assistant perform laboratory exercise student determine operational analytical difficulty test instructional note procedure
Teachers discus usual student question misconception idea directing student learning
Teachers review procedure circulating among student group ensure group get attention
Groups visited early help get started
Each group visited several time least midway lab discus preliminary result interpretation toward end lab review outcome interpretation
Teachers review student notebook report meet discus difficulty misconception
Discussions grading comment might made important procedure influence student performance attitude subsequent exercise
The various method student report lab work different pedagogical objective
The formal written report teach student communicate work journal style student sometimes sacrifice content appearance
Keeping lab notebook graded teach student keep record experiment may develop good writing presentation skill
Oral report motivate student understand work well enough explain others take time give student practice writing
Oral report also motivate student keep good notebook especially consult presentation
In choosing important aspect student lab experience consider student might report work future
Many benefit carefully planned laboratory exercise realized instructional staff well prepared teach
Often primary lab instruction come graduate undergraduate teaching assistant faculty member involved designing lab
Time must invested training teaching staff focusing first mastery lab experiment method instruction
It fine art guide student without either simply giving answer seeming obstinately obscure
Teaching assistant taught way difficulty adapting innovative laboratory program suggestion help guide transition
A good part success course depends group spirit whole team instructor teaching assistant
Many group meet weekly perhaps informal structured way teaching assistant provide feedback instructor well learn effective way teach next laboratory experiment see sidebar
The responsibility preparing teaching assistant largely dependent setting
While many faculty member institution responsible preparing teaching assistant task handled basis program large number graduate student
Many professional society publication topic see
The American Association Higher Education another excellent source information
Their publication Lambert Tice provides numerous example teaching assistant training program wide array discipline
Effective science teaching requires creativity imagination innovation
In light concern American science literacy scientist educator struggled teach discipline effectively
provides undergraduate science educator path understanding student accommodating individual difference helping grasp method wonder science
What impact teaching style
How I plan course curriculum
How I make lecture class laboratory effective
How I tell student thinking
Why understand
This handbook provides productive approach question
Written scientist also educator handbook offer suggestion greater impact classroom provides resource research

Traditional science lesson often begun teacher presenting student science vocabulary word asking write word find definition dictionary glossary textbook match word definition use word sentence
In model instruction word often presented isolation student tested word alone without application concept
Many u taught way remember little practice contributed conceptual development
These traditional strategy stem assumption student absorb meaning many science term simply writing word definition
To many student science word seem like new language English language learner word new language
The job science education teach student use thematic pattern science communicate meaning talking science solve problem writing speaking issue science relevant
The goal helping student learn communicate science important must also aware potentially harmful message unconsciously communicated student
As science educator teach science may communicate mystique science attitude promoting idea science authoritative impersonal humorless lacking creativity value
This communicates view scientist expert rather seeing scientist
Scientific writing talk often project science description way world work rather human social activity try make sense world
We instead help student learn science around u influenced human uncertainty judgment value interest
It important emphasize human side science
These idea nature science lasting effect student need sensitive message communicate
Science creative science tentative mean scientist recognize understand thing based current research
Just think understanding world changed result invention telescope microscope
Science time school often limited result teacher find difficult include science vocabulary instruction help student make sense text
In addition teacher often eager teach content consequently provide brief introduction science term
English language learner added burden trying learn science language yet mastered
The increase English language learner school spawned research elementary student science vocabulary focus ELL student curriculum
Many teacher mistakenly believe ELL student must first learn English learning science fail understand cultural influence learning
Through inquiry instruction student develop content knowledge along language development
Lee Buxton Lewis LeRoy identify science instruction beneficial student following way student participate activity learn vocabulary b student work collaboratively interact others science content c activity offer student written oral graphic kinesthetic form expression
Coupled science activity intentional explicit vocabulary instruction benefit English proficient ELL vocabulary literacy development learn science content
As student combine science experience discussion word us meaning vocabulary content knowledge grow
In order student develop scientific literacy need gain knowledge science content practice scientific habit mind
Knowing science vocabulary support development understanding
As Wellington Osborne point science teacher among thing language By using scientific term phrase science activity science educator model scientific thinking questioning including doubt dilemma part making sense world
The opportunity provide student experience scientific endeavor natural scientific talk develop
Teachers maximize opportunity beginning young student
The suggestion article designed enhance science vocabulary development English proficient student student depend school learn academic English English language learner
By using strategy teacher begin help student engage language science
It important promote student dialogue instructional conversation
We need provide student opportunity use colloquial language translate back forth scientific technical term
We use strategy called discus different explanation student experience classroom
For example We support student information processing supplementing auditory information visual clue
When provide student experience observing communicating help student especially emerging reader English language learner
Instructions given using variety visual aural support material Text card help student interact word meaning
Teachers create science text card writing statement science concept index card
Working individually small group student discus statement sorting
A number different format used These card used two different way Pass one card student find student belong group
Mix card student work small group sort characteristic appropriate group
Additional example strategy include Many teacher use word wall provide visual clue word introduced class
It also important teacher student word much possible
Students look written word teacher use class discussion teacher encourage student use language science verbal written communication
Work student group word feature Traditional game adapted help student experience language science
For advanced student making game using science vocabulary promotes understanding word meaning
Teachers reinforce structure word student identify interpret prefix suffix base word meaning Words multiple meaning confusing student proficient English especially troublesome English language learner
It important discus meaning student
When confuse common definition meaning used science student understanding suffers
For example common use theory mean hunch science theory explanation natural world based solid empirical evidence
Reflections commonly thought thought musing contrast reflection light ray
Many word appear scientific vocabulary everyday speech including Work student identify different meaning application word multiple meaning
When student interact science word multiple way able approach word meaning fully
Graphic organizer help present word range contextual information
This graphic organizer provides template presenting vocabulary word contextual information
The following strategy regarding vocabulary instruction designed English language learner helpful student
While many strategy helping student learn use science vocabulary initial list provides starting point combining science content vocabulary instruction way avoid falling back traditional vocabulary instruction practice
It take concentrated effort fit even time science instruction school day
Modeling use vocabulary word throughout instruction reinforces student comprehension also maximizes teacher instructional time
I try audio record regular basis vocabulary use instruction
In addition gesture dialect intonation semiotics norm specific cultural experience especially English language learner positively affect student learning
Additional strategy help build depth vocabulary knowledge foster word consciousness
Asking student predict meaning word compare prediction student teacher strengthen learning
Interdisciplinary approach blend literacy lesson science also support science literacy
Additionally teacher expose student various form reading listening text provide opportunity student use word speaking writing
Vocabulary instruction effective includes visual verbal physical support therefore physical scaffolding critical teaching
us nonverbal gesture graphic representation convey understanding science concept beneficial student including culturally linguistically diverse student
It important young student recognize value science vocabulary used discourse
Sutton described path initial communication among scientist history Faraday Darwin began personal statement I starting think I seem letter colleague
Sutton lament skewed view science presented child cold static fact rather dynamic discussion wonder
According Wellington Osborne Learning use language science fundamental learning When teacher student share science vocabulary learn communicate science

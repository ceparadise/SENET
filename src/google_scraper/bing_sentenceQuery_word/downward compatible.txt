In computing standard needed build program software work different system
Standards de jure de facto
They also open proprietary
Compatibility important issue making program
You understand system product going compatible
You may develop software phone could also work Windows desktop PC
Companies like Apple Google Microsoft compete computing standard easy create piece software work system
Apple often us unique standard compatible device
For example Apple device iPhones use charger fit device
All manufacturer adopted micro device charging interfacing used different manufacturer phone
Before adopted standard different adapter every phone
The personal computer PC became computer everyday use
Until company generally designed computer compatible product
changed industry standard release compatible PC
IBM used part create computer could upgraded owner part designed IBM
People likely purchase product compatible knew would work computer
Other computer production company saw IBM decided adopt standard
This created competition led compatibility across computer
Microsoft capitalised rise PC creating software like MS DOS Windows Microsoft Office
This software highly compatible different PCs produced company
Microsoft far dominant Apple
Up Apple Microsoft product largely incompatible
In Microsoft agreed support Office Apple computer Apple included Internet Explorer default
Office become one popular software suite kind
This important turning point Apple made Apple computer appealing people wanted use Office
iTunes originally available Apple device
It become available device
The release widely compatible version iTunes led huge boost profit Apple

Backward compatibility allows newer technology advance without superseding current component
Backward compatible also known downward compatible
Backward compatibility refer program system platform
A backward compatible program new application support feature older version
An example would Microsoft Word read open older version back Word
A backward compatible system newer hardware backward compatible older hardware version model
For example PlayStation backward compatible PlayStation PlayStation system

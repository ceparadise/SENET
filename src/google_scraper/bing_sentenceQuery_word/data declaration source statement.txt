In specifies property declares word identifier mean
Declarations particularly prominent language tradition including family prominently also
us term declaration though Java separate declaration definition
A basic dichotomy whether declaration contains example whether declaration constant variable specifies value constant respectively variable type similarly whether declaration function specifies body function type signature
Not language make distinction many language declaration always include definition may referred either declaration definition depending language
However concept distinguished language require declaration use forward declaration used language interface implementation separated interface contains declaration implementation contains definition
In informal usage declaration refers pure declaration type value body definition refers declaration includes value body
However formal usage language specification declaration includes sens finer distinction language C declaration function include body called declaration function include body called function definition
By contrast Java declaration always include body word definition technical meaning Java
In programming language declaration often collected included source file reference use declaration access definition
The information header file provides interface code us declaration defines form
A declaration often used order access function variable defined different source file
A mismatch definition type declaration type generates compiler error
For variable definition assign value area memory reserved declaration phase
For function definition supply function body
While variable function may declared many time typically defined known ODR
Dynamic language generally allow function redefined function variable much like name value definition
Here example declaration definition C Here example declaration definition C In programming language implicit declaration provided first time variable encountered
In language usage considered error may resulting diagnostic message
Some language started implicit declaration behavior matured provided option disable


A declaration statement used specifying data type name
Below example declaration statement
A relation Java programming container hold value used Java program
Instead defining value variable value attached defined
Since variable must given initial starting value see work example page
The following three declaration statement declare variable In addition data type name declaration statement initialize variable value It also possible declare one variable data type one declaration statement The variable int data type
The two boolean variable declared initial value false true respectively
Finally String variable assigned String value Hello
whilst variable simply declared String
There error

Statements similar English language
A sentence form complete idea include one clause
Likewise statement Java form complete command executed include one expression
In simpler term Java statement instruction explains happen

learn share knowledge build career
The meaning eludes
A introduces identifier describes type type object function
A declaration accept reference identifier
These declaration A actually identifier
It order link reference entity
These definition corresponding declaration A definition used place declaration
An identifier often want
Thus following legal C However must exactly
If forget define something declared referenced somewhere linker know link reference complains missing symbol
If define something linker know definition link reference complains duplicated symbol
Since debate class class keep coming answer comment question I paste quote standard
At say A declaration definition unless class name declaration
give example
Amongst To sum The standard considers
In word since form class declaration
Thanks dug actual chapter verse one answer
From standard section A introduces name translation unit redeclares name introduced previous declaration
A declaration specifies interpretation attribute name
The next paragraph state emphasis mine declaration unless declares function without specifying body declares static member within class definition declares class name contains keyword without initializer function body statement
Now big reason important understand difference declaration definition
From section standard No translation unit shall contain one definition variable function class type enumeration type template
Declaration Somewhere exists foo
Definition
There interesting edge case C
Consider That definition declaration depending type In using template another edge case
The last declaration definition
It declaration explicit specialization static member
It tell compiler If come instantiating instantiate definition member primary template use definition found elsewhere
To make definition supply initializer Declarations tell compiler program element name exists
A declaration introduces one name program
Declarations occur program
Therefore class structure enumerated type type declared compilation unit
Definitions specify code data name describes
A name must declared used
From standard A declaration specifies interpretation attribute set identifier
A identifier declaration identifier From standard A declaration unless declares function without specifying function body contains extern specifier neither initializer declares static data member class declaration class name declaration typedef declaration
Then example
So interestingly I slightly surprised definition declaration
From The term declaration mean C telling compiler type size case function declaration type size parameter variable user defined type function program
space reserved memory variable case declaration
However compiler know much space reserve case variable type created
example following declaration Definition hand mean addition thing declaration space also reserved memory
You say DEFINITION DECLARATION SPACE RESERVATION following example definition see
Since I see answer pertinent one
A declaration unless declares Additional clause inherited list A declaration
A also definition declaration defines function class static data member
Examples standard differentiates declaration definition I found helpful understanding nuance definition mean actual function written declaration mean simple declare function
definition function myfunction Thus declaration associate variable type
Following example declaration
Now Note semicolon end function say declaration
Compiler know somewhere program function prototype
Now compiler get function call something like Compiler throw error saying function
Because prototype function
Note difference two program
In print function declared defined well
Since function call coming definition
Now see next program
It essential function call precedes definition compiler must know whether function
So declare function inform compiler
This part defining function called Definition
It say inside function
Now variable
Some time declaration definition grouped single statement like
Couldnt state general term possible declaration identifier storage allocated definition actually allocates storage declared identifier
One interesting thought template allocate storage class function linked type information
So template identifier declaration definition
It declaration since storage allocated simply template class function
Rule thumb A tell compiler interpret variable data memory
This needed every access
A reserve memory make variable existing
This happen exactly first access
Find similar answer A provides name program provides unique description entity
type instance function within program
Declarations repeated given scope introduces name given scope
A declaration definition unless A definition declaration unless Declaration mean give name type variable case variable declaration eg give name return type parameter type function without body case function declaration eg whereas definition mean assign value variable case variable definition
eg body functionality function called function definition
eg many time declaration definition done together In case define declare variable function max This going sound really cheesy best way I able keep term straight head Declaration Picture Thomas Jefferson giving speech I HEREBY DECLARE THAT THIS FOO EXISTS IN THIS SOURCE CODE
Definition picture dictionary looking Foo actually mean
To understand difference declaration definition need see assembly code definition As see nothing change
Declaration different definition give information used compiler
For example tell compiler use asm function movb
See Declaration equivalent instruction something executed
Furthermore declaration tell compiler scope variable
We say declaration information used compiler establish correct use variable long memory belongs certain variable
A declaration introduces name program definition provides unique description entity
type instance function
Declarations repeated given scope introduces name given scope
There must exactly one definition every object function class used program
A declaration definition unless A definition declaration unless Difference declaring defining function The prototype statement function declares
tell compiler function name return type number type parameter
The function header followed body function defines function giving detail step perform function operation
Ex
Code With Respect Variables For automatic register variable difference definition declaration
The process declaring automatic register variable defines variable name allocates appropriate memory
However external variable Because memory variable must allocated ensure access variable always refers cell
variable must defined
If external variable used file one defined mechanism needed connect use uniquely defined external variable cell allocated
This process connecting reference external variable different file called resolving reference
It may defined declared declaration statement outside function storage class specifier
Such declaration allocates memory variable
A declaration statement may also used simply declare variable name extern storage class specifier beginning declaration
Such declaration specifies variable defined elsewhere
memory variable allocated another file
Thus access external variable file one defined possible declared keyword extern new memory allocated
Such declaration tell compiler variable defined elsewhere code compiled external variable left unresolved
The reference external variable resolved linking process
Ex
Code These declaration tell compiler variable stack stkptr defined elsewhere usually file
If keyword extern omitted variable would considered new one memory would allocated
Remember access external variable defined another file possible keyword extern used declaration
The concept Declaration Definition form pitfall using extern storage class definition location declaring variable local code file page
One difference C C declaration done normally beginning function code page
In like
You declare place choice
My favorite example int Num variable defined int declared Num instantiated value five
We A class struct allows change object defined later used
For example When learn programming two term often confused often time
Whenever write function main function compiler error since idea function time calling function
If provide prototype declaration function compiler look definition
In example first line called function declaration
Whenever write declaration statement memory allocated variable
Variable declaration randomly specify memory location
Whenever declare variable space reserved variable
Whenever declare variable compiler look detail definition variable
Declaration handy way write code actual memory allocated
In declaration memory allocated
Whenever define variable memory allocated variable
A declaration present symbol name compiler
A definition declaration allocates space symbol
A variable compiler informed variable exists type allocate storage variable point
A variable compiler allocates storage variable

Computer program use data type organise different type data program
Data also constant variable within program function
In order change stored use operation called
This cause value copied overwriting
Different value may variable different time program
Each assignment overwrites current value new one
The scope variable local global
Declaring name variable saying stored memory
Information used program given form
These section program code define name used refer variable kind data hold

In syntactic unit express action carried
A program written language formed sequence one statement
A statement may internal component
Many imperative language
make distinction statement definition statement containing executable code definition instantiating expression evaluates value
A distinction also made simple compound statement latter may contain statement component
The following major generic kind statement pseudocoded
These pseudocoded statement immediate corresponding syntax typical imperative language like Pascal C Fortran etc
The appearance statement shape look program
Programming language characterized type statement use
family
Many statement introduced like
Often statement reserved used name
Imperative language typically use special syntax statement look quite different function call
Common method describe syntax statement
Semantically many statement differ call handling
Usually actual subroutine parameter evaluated subroutine called
This contrast many statement parameter evaluated several time
condition
loop body loop
Technically statement parameter parameter
parameter evaluated needed see also
When parameter available statement like behaviour implemented subroutine see
For language without parameter semantic description usually beyond capability language
Therefore standard document often refer semantic description natural language
In language statement contrast statement return result executed solely expression always return result often side effect
Among imperative programming language one statement return result
In language mix imperative style family distinction expression statement made even expression executed sequential context solely side effect whose return value used considered
In statement everything expression
This distinction frequently observed wording statement expression
This found function found language Python found applied statement applied expression
Most language fixed set statement defined language experiment allow programmer define new statement

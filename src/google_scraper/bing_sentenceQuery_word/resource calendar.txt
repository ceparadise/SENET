Despite name Computer Science really science computer
Computers quite remarkable electronic device even remarkable made simulate flow air wing manage communication Internet control action robot synthesize realistic image play chess
Indeed application computer activity like affected area modern life
What task common little physic electronics computer matter formulated sort computation
This real subject matter Computer Science computation done computationally
In trying make sense get computer wide variety topic come
There however two recurring theme
The first issue scale big system specify without getting lost design big task computer handle within reasonable bound time memory accuracy
A large part Computer Science deal question one form another
In area programming language methodology example look notation describing computation programming methodology facilitate production manageable efficient software
In theory computation area study resource requirement time memory many basic computational task
The second theme concern scope computation
Computers originally conceived purely numerical calculator today tend view much broadly
Part Computer Science concerned understanding far computational idea applied
In area artificial intelligence example ask much intelligent behaviour people expressed computational term
In area interaction ask sort normal activity people might supported augmented using computer

Recently I discussion colleague resource calendar inspiration week post
This week I also rolling format feature use course use
Let begin basic
In vocabulary Microsoft Project occurs assigned
When work occur controlled several thing including If stack calendar begin see work occur Of three calendar project calendar simplest understand think project open business scheduled work occur
To overlay specific resource working time exception project calendar need create task calendar limit one specific task scheduled
Lots Project user go default project calendar need customize
However may frequently need make adjustment resource calendar
Two common need include The first example exception Toby resource calendar
If Toby work scheduled Friday January setting day nonworking day resource calendar cause Project push forward Toby assignment future
If Toby resource assigned task Friday net effect Project split task work scheduled Friday
The second example ongoing situation affect scheduling Jun work indefinitely
Recall initial resource calendar Project creates resource initially exactly match project calendar
If never customize resource calendar really getting benefit feature
By customizing resource calendar precisely model resource really going available work assigned task
This produce good result resource Both project resource calendar use interface customizations Project tab Properties group Change Working Time command
For matter use command edit calendar associate task task calendar
To begin first I enter working time exception resource
Our resource Toby Nixon conference next Friday January
Checking initial Project plan see Toby currently assignment task includes January
Click screenshot image larger view
I visit Change Working Time dialog box For calendar box I select Toby Nixon
I ca tell many time I forgot pick specific resource ended inadvertently editing project calendar
Now I right resource name selected I ready enter working time exception
In lower part dialog box Exceptions tab I enter detail I click OK complete resource calendar customization Project responds expected
Note duration task still day extends Thursday following Monday
That Toby planned work Friday pushed next available working day Monday
The Gantt bar task reveal detail one reliable way I see level detail I want switch usage view
Here Toby assignment detail task Task Usage view In view clearly see task Toby hour work scheduled Thursday none Friday due resource calendar exception remaining hour scheduled Monday
Next week I cover detail making recurring resource calendar adjustment

Note difference mathematical performance student result hard work
Increasingly vast technologically glued world experience need stand theory hold quantitative analysis
Hence ability mathematics definitely helpful
However knowledge mathematics rather familiarity comfort algorithmic reasoning correlate success computing discipline
Most successful Computer Science student demonstrated ability flexible adaptable
MORPH well
Specifically MORPH trait include Mature Clarity thought focused career vision
ii Organized Able manage time balance personal work habit
iii Responsible Ability take lead handle responsibility
iv Persistence Ability tenacious deliberative problem solving
v Helpful consciousness supportive diverse need reach discipline
For example many good student class one could finish assignment class first attempt one made learned mistake dogged persistence sheer hard work
One key attribute successful major ability think logically Computer Science parlance algorithmically
This mean developing ability break problem series small step solved logical sequence action
To succeed discipline aspiring student must seek obtain strong high school background math science build skill develop strong oral written communication skill develop ability work team environment
As creative discipline curious imaginative mind abundance successful essential

The chapter called Admissions Financial Aid describes transfer policy general term
Your transfer work evaluated required document received
All transfer student initially admitted University College
Please check transfer articulation agreement
If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution
If please discus UALR academic advisor answer question student transfer credit aspect student academic program study

Suppose select Standard calendar template project Hours task calendar template
If specify task duration one day one day assuming assigned resource also use calendar allowing schedule machinery
To modify setting task calendar follow step task name
The Task Information dialog box appears
Click Advanced tab
From Calendar list choose different base calendar
Click OK button save new calendar setting
If resource assigned task modified calendar resource work specific hour task calendar resource calendar common
Only work resource calendar
That material resource charged time worked unit used cost resource assigned set cost relate time worked task
Even resourceful resource many hour day work
When deal variation resource schedule consider modifying resource calendar
You change base calendar template work resource set specific date working nonworking
These exception take precedence project task calendar control specific resource work
Unless resource truly unique working schedule change base calendar template
For example resource usually work day shift work night shift day life project change resource base calendar template Night Shift
Unless project deal detailed level time hour day typical unit measure task making type change work worth
To modify resource calendar setting follow step Display view includes resource column Resource Sheet view
Simply select view list appears click bottom Gantt Chart button Task tab Ribbon
resource name
The Resource Information dialog box appears
Click Change Working Time button General tab display Change Working Time dialog box
The Exceptions Work Weeks tab setting identical one Change Working Time dialog box task change made affect resource rather task
In Click Day See Its Working Times calendar section click day want change
Click Work Weeks tab display click blank row enter name exception press Enter
If want edit default work week week year leave Default selected instead
If want mark single holiday use Exceptions tab instead
Click exception created click Details button
The Details dialog box exception appears
Select day day modify Select Day list left side
You click first day select range adjacent day select nonadjacent day
To set working time exception select either Nonworking Working ratio button
If chose latter option Step enter time range From To field
To delete row From To area click row number press Delete
To set nonconsecutive hour example build lunch break put two set number start finish column
Set range recurrence
Set start date occurrence select End After radio button enter number occurrence select End By instead enter end date recurrence
Click OK button close Change Working Time dialog box save change
Micromanaging nonworking time resource leave time anything else avoid urge
For example someone take half day doctor appointment block day
However resource take vacation sabbatical probably modify resource calendar
Resources work overtime even calendar say though tell Project schedule overtime work
You also set different rate charged overtime work resource

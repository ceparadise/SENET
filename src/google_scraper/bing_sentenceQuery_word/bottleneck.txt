In occurs capacity computer system severely limited single component like neck bottle slowing overall water flow
The bottleneck lowest throughput part transaction path
A common example bottleneck powerful CPU bottlenecked GPU
With powerful GPU CPU would able fully utilized
As system designer try avoid bottleneck direct effort towards locating tuning existing bottleneck
Some example possible engineering bottleneck etc
Any system application hit bottleneck work arrives sufficiently fast pace
Tracking bottleneck sometimes known hot spot section code execute frequently
highest execution count called
Reduction usually achieved help specialized tool known
The objective make particular section code perform fast possible improve overall

Bottlenecks affect microprocessor performance slowing flow information back forth
If component system able feed amount data speed delay created
For example processor severely bottlenecked memory bandwidth
Bottlenecks affect network performance slowing flow information transmitted across network
connection originally designed transmit proliferation transmission graphic caused bottleneck process therefore data move slowly across network
To delay tranmission data data path

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Whether laptop desktop computer made several piece hardware communicate
Sending data back forth ensure user get desired result
I seen theoretical stuff computer hardware I wonder come together
And thing
Which biggest bottle neck
Why would person big value one category certain situation

reading spec processor I came across description In place FSB one high speed bus called Quick Path Interconnect QPI used formerly known Common Serial Interconnect Bus CSI
QPI feature higher bandwidth traditional FSB better suited system scaling
What compare FSB
EDIT I planning buy computer
The goal question understand internal relation various hardware piece specific function work together
For instance I heard somewhat amount Cache help speed computer
What saying
Also I forgot mention RPM
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
As always depends
It help know exactly need machine
Ask couple friend use way let look performance try determine exactly bottleneck machine
Then take best guess
I generally found worth given little bit processor frequency favor RAM faster
But running physic simulation analysis code
These code hold lot memory lot looking thing database logging flushing buffer insure large data loss event crash thus biggest demand RAM fast disk If trying build general purpose machine I would recommend trying get component price point hit diminishing return widget
That work pretty well
Fast hard drive mean high throughput large cache
A lot computer part bottleneck another part
Here I bring list cause bottleneck loss performance crash explain fix
The list long I split two part software hardware
Note As long I think wo read text jump part interest much Note Feel free edit tell I miss something tell something wrong
Feedback good
Let start software side
Note speed hard drive usually visible starting program program move RAM booting OS
Shortly fast drive program game load rapidly
Not talking server computer When running drive speed cause performance loss
OS move memory page RAM HDD vice versa HDD speed slow performance suffer lot
If always running low memory help way buy bigger RAM faster HDD
Note RAM speed size essential building fast computer computer part talk RAM frequently
So slow little RAM usually reduces overall performance
For example Core fast hard drive RAM feel full power fast computer
Look frequency size buying RAMs
Two different RAMs sometimes work error put together
When buying RAM chip consider buying RAM kit
swap size may cause performance loss
OS move inactive memory page RAM paging file HDD vice versa allocate memory active process
When RAM big page file size little may run memory
On hand RAM size big big paging file slow computer
So page file size selected correctly improve performance otherwise slow computer
Fast RAM slower frequency slot another mistake
In case RAM run slow frequency
may run notice fast performance overclock
Make sure motherboard support RAM speed buying
CPU overheating cause crash performance loss computer freeze BSOD
Overheating common issue talking CPU
So buy quality fan sure fan running properly remember change thermal paste necessary
Use tool like monitor CPU temperature fan speed change thermal paste CPU temperature close maximum allowed temperature
Note newbie
obviously CPU frequency core thread count important thing computer performance
Nothing help fast drive memory videocard CPU still Pentium
Some CPUs videocards part may use watt high load high temperature PSU ca supply enough energy computer may behave way Power case know work saved
Also computer part may struggle little bit
But best thing happen
PSU care supply low wattage may see sudden blue screen
Sometimes decrease hardware lifetime
PSU care low quality PSUs really burn hardware
They simply ignore supply current wire wire get hot melt even burn
Anyway may immediately kill hardware get control
So buying PSU make sure supply enough power computer computer full load leave watt headroom
On top pay attention
show much energy PSU supply computer
For example energy supplied computer wasted heating fan
Continuous wattage show much energy PSU supply computer matter much PC loaded
For example continuous wattage sure stay stable even computer high load
But cheap manufacturer often write maximum wattage specification real stable wattage
So sure add another headroom buy cheap PSU
For info PSU check
In personal experience slowest component modern PC hard drive
Proof pay attention operation make wait front PC note HDD diode flashing wait time
So intend component new PC far performance per dollar concerned HDD slowest component
RAID could help really add noise vibration unless make RAID SSDs
wrote blog subject
It constantly flux depending use
I could hdd I used webapps lynx I probably would mind much
Even though topic going two year old I agree even two year later hard drive generally biggest bottleneck
My home computer running Core SSD work computer running quad core HDD
My home computer boot log literally second le work computer sometimes take several minute
Granted work computer managed machine requires script run even day day functionality significantly slower machine
In opinion least business world HDD far single biggest cause computer slowness ultimately user frustration particularly laptop RPM hard drive made illegal
Q Which biggest bottleneck
A The hard disk
Most PC user still use good old rotating hard disk
Those real bottleneck come data transfer
The CPU RAM Cache GPU pretty much fast except HDD
Try getting hand SSD see difference asked viewed active site design logo Stack Exchange Inc user contribution licensed

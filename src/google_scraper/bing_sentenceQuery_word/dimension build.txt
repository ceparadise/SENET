Follow u As probably noticed live world defined three spatial dimension one dimension time
In word take three number pinpoint physical location given moment
On coordinate break longitude latitude altitude representing dimension length width height depth
Slap time stamp coordinate pinpointed time well
To strip even world would like single bead measured thread
You slide bead forward slide bead backward need one number figure exact location string length
Where bead
It mark
Now let upgrade world
This essentially flat map like playing field game Battleship chess
You need length width determine location
In Battleship say know location convergence horizontal E line vertical line
Now let add one dimension
Our world factor height depth equation locating submarine exact location Battleship requires two number submarine would demand third coordinate depth
Sure might charging along surface might also hiding foot meter beneath wave
Which
Could fourth spatial dimension
Well tricky question currently ca perceive measure anything beyond dimension length width height
Just three number required pinpoint location world world would require four
At moment likely positioned particular longitude latitude altitude
Walk little left alter longitude latitude
Stand chair exact spot alter altitude
Here get hard Can move current location without altering longitude latitude altitude
You ca fourth spatial dimension u move
But fact ca move fourth spatial dimension perceive one necessarily rule existence
In mathematician Theodor Kaluza theorized fourth spatial dimension might link general relativity electromagnetic theory source
But would go
Theoretical physicist Oskar Klein later revised theory proposing fourth dimension merely curled three spatial dimension extended
In word fourth dimension rolled unseen little like fully retracted tape measure
Furthermore would mean every point world would additional fourth spatial dimension rolled away inside
String theorist however need slightly complicated vision empower superstring theory cosmos
In fact quite easy assume showing bit proposing dimension including time
Wait let blow mind yet
One way envisioning imagine point world contains retracted tape measure geometric shape
One example shape look bit like cross mollusk
Escher drawing Star Trek holiday ornament source
Think way A concrete wall look solid firm distance
Move closer however see dimple hole mark surface
Move even closer see made molecule
Or consider cable From distance appears single thick strand
Get right next find woven countless strand
There always greater complexity meet eye hidden complexity may well conceal tiny dimension
Yet remain certain three spatial dimension one time
If dimension await u beyond limited perception
Explore link next page learn even universe

In simply consisting collection identified least one
An array stored position element computed index mathematical formula
The simplest type data structure linear array also called array
For example array integer variable index may stored memory address element index address
The memory address first element array called first address foundation address
Because mathematical concept represented grid array also sometimes called matrix
In case term vector used computing refer array although rather correctly mathematical equivalent
Arrays often used implement especially word sometimes used synonym
Arrays among oldest important data structure used almost every program
They also used implement many data structure
They effectively exploit addressing logic computer
In modern computer many device memory array word whose index address
especially often optimized array operation
Arrays useful mostly element index computed
Among thing feature allows single iterative process arbitrarily many element array
For reason element array data structure required size use data representation
The set valid index tuples address element hence element addressing formula usually always fixed array use
The term often used mean kind provided consists collection value variable selected one index computed
Array type often implemented array structure however language may implemented data structure
The term also used especially description mean abstract array model ADT intended capture essential property array
Arrays better cache locality compared
The first digital computer used programming set access array structure data table vector matrix computation many purpose
wrote first program building
Array indexing originally done later using
Some mainframe designed successor used perform checking hardware
Assembly language generally special support array machine provides
The earliest programming language including support array
In class template exist array whose dimension fixed runtime well array
Arrays used implement mathematical well kind rectangular table
Many small large consist include array whose element
Arrays used implement data structure list
implementation data structure frequently simple requiring little space may poor space complexity particularly modified compared data structure compare
One large array sometimes used emulate particularly allocation
Historically sometimes way allocate dynamic memory portably
Arrays used determine partial complete program compact alternative otherwise repetitive multiple statement
They known context used conjunction purpose built interpreter whose altered according value contained array
The array may contain relative subroutine number acted upon statement direct path execution
When data object stored array individual object selected index usually
Indexes also called subscript
An index array value stored object
There three way element array indexed Arrays multiple dimension thus uncommon access array using multiple index
For example array three row four column might provide access element row column expression case indexing system
Thus two index used array three array array
The number index needed specify element called dimension dimensionality array
In standard array index restricted certain range consecutive integer consecutive value address element computed linear formula index
A array single dimension array type linear array
Accessing element involves single subscript either represent row column index
As example consider C declaration Syntax datatype anArrayname sizeofArray In given example array contain element value available type
In C array element index inclusive case
For example expression first last element respectively
For vector linear addressing element index located address fixed fixed constant sometimes called
If valid element index begin constant simply address first element array
For reason specifies array index always begin many programmer call element rather first
However one choose index first element appropriate choice base address
For example array five element indexed base address replaced index element
If numbering start constant may address element
For multidimensional array element index would address coefficient respectively
More generally array address element index For example int This mean array row column array integer type
Here store element stored linearly starting first row linear continuing second row
The array stored
This formula requires multiplication addition array fit memory
Moreover coefficient fixed power multiplication replaced
The coefficient must chosen every valid index tuple map address distinct element
If minimum legal value every index address element whose index zero
As case element index may changed changing base address
Thus array row column indexed respectively replacing cause renumbered respectively
Taking advantage feature language like FORTRAN specify array index begin mathematical tradition language like Fortran Pascal Algol let user choose minimum value index
The addressing formula completely defined dimension base address increment
It often useful pack parameter record called array
The size element minimum maximum value allowed index may also included dope vector
The dope vector complete array convenient way pas array argument
Many useful operation selecting swapping index reversing direction index performed efficiently manipulating dope vector
Often coefficient chosen element occupy contiguous area memory
However necessary
Even array always created contiguous element array slicing operation may create
There two systematic compact layout array
For example consider matrix In order layout adopted C statically declared array element row stored consecutive position element row lower address element consecutive row In order traditionally used Fortran element column consecutive memory element column lower address element consecutive column For array three index row major order put consecutive position two element whose index tuples differ one index
Column major order analogous respect index
In system use scanning array much faster successive element stored consecutive position memory rather sparsely scattered
Many algorithm use multidimensional array scan predictable order
A programmer sophisticated compiler may use information choose layout array
For example computing product two matrix would best stored order order
Static array size fixed created consequently allow element inserted removed
However allocating new array copying content old array possible effectively implement version array see
If operation done infrequently insertion end array require amortized constant time
Some array data structure reallocate storage store count number element array use called count size
This effectively make array fixed maximum size capacity example
More complicated formula occasionally used
For compact instance addressing formula polynomial degree
Both take deterministic worst case
Arrays take linear space number element hold
In array element size machine cache line size B byte iterating array element requires minimum ceiling cache miss element occupy contiguous memory location
This roughly factor better number cache miss needed access element random memory location
As consequence sequential iteration array noticeably faster practice iteration many data structure property called mean however using within local array even faster achievable
Libraries provide optimized facility copying range memory used move block array element significantly faster achieved individual element access
The speedup optimized routine varies array element size architecture implementation
array compact data structure
There may overhead
store index bound
It also happen element stored array require memory element stored individual variable several array element stored single array often called array
An extreme commonly used case every bit represents single element
A single thus hold different combination different condition compact form
Array access statically predictable access pattern major source
similar array add ability insert delete element adding deleting end particularly efficient
However reserve linear additional storage whereas array reserve additional storage
provide mechanism functionality without huge storage overhead index value sparse
For example array contains value index billion may benefit using structure
Specialized associative array integer key include
require O log time indexed access also permit inserting deleting element O log time whereas growable array require linear Œò time insert delete element arbitrary position
allow constant time removal insertion middle take linear time indexed access
Their memory use typically worse array still linear
An alternative multidimensional array structure
It us array array one dimension le
For two dimension particular alternative structure would vector pointer vector one row
Thus element row column array would accessed double indexing typical notation
This alternative structure allows row may different size general valid range index depends value preceding index
It also save one multiplication column address increment replacing bit shift index vector row pointer one extra memory access fetching row address may worthwhile architecture
The dimension array number index needed select element
Thus array seen function set possible index combination dimension space domain discrete subset
Thus array list data array rectangle data array block data etc
This confused dimension set matrix given domain number element array
For example array row column matrix form space
Similarly vector represented array size three

Computer simulation pioneered scientific tool meteorology nuclear physic period directly following World War II since become indispensable growing number discipline
The list science make extensive use computer simulation grown include astrophysics particle physic material science engineering fluid mechanic climate science evolutionary biology ecology economics decision theory medicine sociology epidemiology many others
There even discipline chaos theory complexity theory whose existence emerged alongside development computational model study
After slow start philosopher science begun devote attention role computer simulation science
Several area philosophical interest computer simulation emerged What structure epistemology computer simulation
What relationship computer simulation experiment
Does computer simulation raise issue philosophy science fully covered recent work model generally
What computer simulation teach u emergence
About structure scientific theory
About role fiction scientific modeling
No single definition computer simulation appropriate
In first place term used narrow broad sense
In second place one might want understand term one point view
In narrowest sense computer simulation program run computer us method explore approximate behavior mathematical model
Usually model system although system question might imaginary hypothetical one
Such computer program
One run program computer computer simulation system
The algorithm take input specification state value variable time It calculates system state time
From value characterizing second state calculates system state time
When run computer algorithm thus produce numerical picture evolution system state conceptualized model
This sequence value model variable saved large collection data often viewed computer screen using method visualization
Often certainly always method visualization designed output scientific simulation appears measuring system interest
Sometimes method computer simulation used model interest contains continuous differential equation specify continuous rate change time solved principle perhaps practice
This underwrites spirit following definition given Paul Humphreys method exploring property mathematical model analytic method available
But even narrow definition one read carefully taken suggest simulation used analytically unsolvable equation model
Computer simulation often used either original model contains discrete directly implemented algorithm suitable original model consists something better described
In former case equation discretized turning equation describe continuous rate change discrete equation emphasized although common speak simulation solving equation discretization best find something approximates solution continuous equation desired degree accuracy
Finally speaking computer simulation narrowest sense speaking particular implementation algorithm particular digital computer written particular language using particular compiler etc
There case different result obtained result variation particular
More broadly think computer simulation comprehensive method studying system
In broader sense term refers entire process
This process includes choosing model finding way implementing model form run computer calculating output algorithm visualizing studying resultant data
The method includes entire make inference target system one try well procedure used sanction inference
This le definition computer simulation Winsberg
Successful simulation study compute number
They make use variety technique draw inference number
Simulations make creative use calculational technique motivated
As unlike simple computation carried computer result simulation automatically reliable
Much effort expertise go deciding simulation result reliable When philosopher science write computer simulation make claim epistemological methodological property computer simulation usually mean term understood broad sense computer simulation study
Both definition take computer simulation fundamentally using computer solve approximately solve mathematical equation model meant represent real hypothetical
Another approach try define simulation independently notion computer simulation define computer simulation compositionally simulation carried programmed digital computer
On approach simulation system believed hoped dynamical behavior similar enough system former studied learn latter
For example study object believe sufficiently dynamically similar basin fluid u learn basin fluid studying provides simulation basin fluid
This line definition simulation find Hartmann something imitates one process another process
In definition term process refers solely object system whose state change time
Hughes objected Hartmann definition ruled simulation imitate structure rather dynamic
Humphreys revised definition simulation accord remark Hartmann Hughes follows Note Humphreys defining computer simulation simulation generally spirit defining compositional term
It noted Humphreys definition make simulation success term seems unfortunate
A better definition would one like one last section included word like believed hoped address issue
In philosophical discussion computer simulation useful concept one defined
The exception explicitly goal discussion understand computer simulation example simulation generally see section
Examples simulation computer simulation include famous physical model San Francisco Bay Huggins Schultz
This working hydraulic scale model San Francisco Bay Joaquin River Delta System built Army Corps engineer study possible engineering intervention Bay
Another nice example discussed extensively Dardashti et al
forthcoming use acoustic dumb hole made condensate study behavior Black Holes
Physicist Bill Unruh noted certain fluid something akin black hole would arise region fluid moving fast wave would move faster speed sound something order escape Unruh
Such region would effect sonic event horizon
Unruh called physical setup dumb hole dumb mute proposed could studied order learn thing know black hole
For time proposal viewed nothing clever idea physicist recently come realize using condensate actually build study dumb hole laboratory
It clear think setup simulation dumb hole simulates black hole
Instead finding computer program simulate black hole physicist find fluid dynamical setup believe good model model fundamental mathematical similarity model system interest
They observe behavior fluid setup laboratory order make inference black hole
The point definition simulation section try understand sense computer simulation sort activity specie genus
We might better situation understand simulation sense happens run computer overlap simulation sense
We come back section
Barberousse et al
however critical analogy
They point computer simulation work way Unruh simulation work
It case computer material object target system follow differential equation
A good reference simulation computer simulation Trenholme
Two type computer simulation often distinguished
Computer Simulations type used three different general sort purpose prediction pointwise understanding exploratory heuristic purpose
simulation commonly used physical science science governing theory guide construction mathematical model based differential equation
I use term equation based refer simulation based kind global equation associate physical opposed rule evolution discussed next section
Equation based simulation either n many discrete body set differential equation governing interaction set equation governing time evolution continuous medium field
An example former simulation galaxy formation gravitational interaction finite collection discrete body discretized time space
An example latter simulation fluid meteorological system like severe storm
Here system treated continuous field representing distribution relevant variable space discritized space updated discrete interval time
simulation common social behavioral science though also find discipline artificial life epidemiology ecology discipline networked interaction many individual studied
simulation similar simulation represent behavior discrete individual
But unlike simulation global differential equation govern motion individual
Rather simulation behavior individual dictated local rule To give one example famous groundbreaking simulation Thomas Schelling model The agent simulation individual lived chessboard
The individual divided two group society
two different race boy girl smoker etc
Each square board represented house one person per house
An individual happy certain percent neighbor group
Happy agent stay unhappy agent move free location
Schelling found board quickly evolved strongly segregated location pattern agent happiness rule specified segregation heavily favored
Surprisingly however also found initially integrated board tipped full segregation even agent happiness rule expressed mild preference neighbor type
In section discussed model based particle method based field method
But simulation model hybrid different kind modeling method
Multiscale simulation model particular couple together modeling element different scale description
A good example would model simulates dynamic bulk matter treating material field undergoing stress strain relatively coarse level description zoom particular region material important small scale effect taking place model smaller region relatively modeling method
Such method might rely molecular dynamic quantum mechanic description matter offered treating material field
Multiscale simulation method broken serial multiscale parallel multiscale method
The traditional method serial modeling
The idea choose region simulate lower level description summarize result set parameter digestible higher level model pas part algorithm calculating higher level
Serial multiscale method effective different scale strongly coupled together
When different scale interact strongly produce observed behavior required approach simulates region simultaneously
This called parallel multiscale modeling
Parallel multiscale modeling foundation nearly ubiquitous simulation method called modeling
modelingrefers representation important physical process occur adequately resolved grid size particular simulation
Remember many simulation discretize continuous equation relatively arbitrary finite grid In study turbulence fluid example common practical strategy calculation account missing fall inside grid cell
This done adding motion characterizes transport dissipation energy feature occurs small scale captured grid
In climate science kindred discipline modeling called This refers method replacing complex physically represented simple mathematical description
This opposed flow calculated grid level accordance basic theory
It called parameterization various needed drive highly approximative algorithm compute value
Examples parameterization climate simulation include descent rate raindrop rate atmospheric radiative transfer rate cloud formation
For example average cloudiness km grid box cleanly related average humidity box
Nonetheless average humidity increase average cloudiness also could parameter linking average cloudiness average humidity inside grid box
Even though parameterizations cloud formation sophisticated basic idea well illustrated example
The use modeling method simulation important consequence understanding structure epistemology simulation
This discussed greater detail section
modelling method contrasted another kind parallel multiscale model algorithm theoretically principled motivated theory different level description
In example simulation bulk matter mentioned example algorithm driving smaller level description built
The algorithm driving smaller level actually theoretically principled higher level sense physic fundamental quantum mechanic molecular dynamic continuum mechanic
These kind multiscale model word cobble together resource theory different level description
So provide interesting example provoke thinking intertheoretic relationship challenge view inconsistent set law model
In scientific literature another large class computer simulation called Monte Carlo MC Simulations
MC simulation computer algorithm use randomness calculate property mathematical model randomness algorithm feature target model
A nice example use random algorithm calculate value œÄ
If draw unit square piece paper inscribe circle randomly drop collection object inside square proportion object land circle would roughly equal
A computer simulation simulated procedure like would called MC simulation calculating œÄ
Many philosopher science deviated ordinary scientific language shied away thinking MC simulation genuine simulation
Weirich offer following reasoning The Monte Carlo approach mimetic purpose It imitates deterministic system order serve surrogate investigated stead order offer alternative computation deterministic system property
This show MC simulation fit definition aptly
On hand divide philosopher ordinary language perhaps squared noting MC simulation simulate imaginary process might used calculating something relevant studying process
Suppose I modeling planetary orbit calculation I need know value œÄ
If I MC simulation mentioned last paragraph I simulating process randomly dropping object square I modeling planetary orbit
This sense MC simulation simulation simulation system used study
However Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources point MC simulation viz
use MC technique solve stochastic dynamical equation referring physical system fact simulation system study
There three general category purpose computer simulation put
Simulations used heuristic purpose purpose predicting data generating understanding data already
Under category heuristic model simulation subdivided used communicate knowledge others used represent information
When Watson Crick played tin plate wire latter first former showed result others
When army corp built model San Francisco Bay convince voting population particular intervention dangerous using kind heuristic purpose
Computer simulation used kind explore feature possible representational structure communicate knowledge others
For example computer simulation natural process bacterial reproduction tectonic shifting chemical reaction evolution used classroom setting help student visualize hidden structure phenomenon process impractical impossible costly illustrate wet laboratory setting
Another broad class purpose computer simulation put telling u expect system real world behave particular set circumstance
Loosely speaking computer simulation used prediction
We use model predict future retrodict past use make precise prediction loose general one
With regard relative precision prediction make simulation slightly finegrained taxonomy
There Point prediction Where planet Mars October
b Qualitative global systemic prediction Is orbit planet stable
What scaling law emerges kind system
What fractal dimension attractor system kind
c Range prediction It likely global mean surface temperature increase degree C year highly likely sea level rise least two foot implausible thermohaline shut next year
Finally simulation used understand system behavior
If already data telling u system behaves use computer simulation answer question event could possibly occurred event actually occur
When thinking topic next section epistemology computer simulation also keep mind procedure needed sanction result simulation often depend large part kind purpose purpose simulation put
As computer simulation method gained importance discipline issue trustworthiness generating new knowledge grown especially simulation expected counted epistemic peer experiment traditional analytic theoretical method
The relevant question always whether result particular computer simulation accurate enough intended purpose
If simulation used weather predict variable interested degree accuracy sufficient meet need consumer
If simulation atmosphere Midwestern plain used structure severe thunderstorm confidence structure one play explanatory role account storm sometimes split two sometimes form depicted accurately enough support confidence explanation
If simulation used engineering design prediction made simulation reliable enough sanction particular choice design parameter sanction belief particular design airplane wing function
Assuming answer question sometimes yes
kind inference least sometimes justified central philosophical question justifies
More generally claim simulation good enough intended purpose evaluated
These central question epistemology computer simulation EOCS
Given confirmation theory one traditional topic philosophy science might seem obvious latter would resource begin approach question
Winsberg however argued come topic related credentialing knowledge claim philosophy science traditionally concerned justification theory application
Most simulation hand extent make use theory tends make use theory
EOCS word rarely testing basic theory may go simulation often establishing credibility hypothesis part result application theory
Winsberg argued unlike epistemological issue take center stage traditional confirmation theory adequate EOCS must meet three condition
In particular must take account fact knowledge produced computer simulation result inference

EOCS must reflect fact large number case accepted scientific theory starting point construction computer simulation model play important role justification inference simulation result conclusion target system
The word downward meant signal fact unlike scientific inference traditionally interested philosopher move observation instance theory inference drawn part high theory particular feature phenomenon

EOCS must take account simulation result nevertheless typically depend theory many model ingredient resource well including parameterizations discussed numerical solution method mathematical trick approximation idealization outright fiction ad hoc assumption function library compiler computer hardware perhaps importantly blood sweat tear much trial error

EOCS must take account autonomy knowledge produced simulation sense knowledge produced simulation sanctioned entirely comparison observation
Simulations usually employed study phenomenon data sparse
In circumstance simulation meant replace experiment observation source data world relevant experiment observation reach principled practical ethical reason
Parker forthcoming made point usefulness condition somewhat compromised fact overly focused simulation physical science discipline simulation
This seems correct
In social behavioral science discipline simulation see norm model built absence established quantitative theory EOCS probably ought characterized term
For instance social scientist use simulation pursue methodology social phenomenon example observed pattern like segregation explained accounted generating similar looking phenomenon simulation Epstein Axtell Epstein
But raise sort epistemological question
What exactly accomplished kind knowledge acquired observed social phenomenon le reproduced simulation
Does count explanation phenomenon
A possible explanation
see
It also fair say Parker forthcoming condition outlined pay insufficient attention various differing purpose simulation used discussed
If using simulation make detailed quantitative prediction future behavior target system epistemology inference might require stringent standard involved inference made general qualitative behavior whole class system
Indeed also fair say much work could done classifying kind purpose computer simulation put constraint purpose place structure epistemology
Frigg Reiss argued none three condition new computer simulation
They argued ordinary paper pencil modeling incorporate feature
Indeed argued computer simulation could possibly raise new epistemological issue epistemological issue could cleanly divided question appropriateness model underlying simulation issue identical epistemological issue arise ordinary modeling question correctness solution model equation delivered simulation mathematical question one related epistemology science
On first point Winsberg replied simultaneous confluence three feature new simulation
We return second point section Some work EOCS developed analogy computer simulation order draw recent work epistemology experiment particularly work Allan Franklin
see entry
In work epistemology experiment Alan Franklin identified number strategy experimenter use increase rational confidence result
Weissart Parker argued various form analogy strategy number strategy available simulationists sanction result
The detailed analysis relationship found Parker also us analogy highlight weakness current approach simulation model evaluation
Winsberg also make use Ian Hacking work philosophy experiment
One central insight experiment captured slogan experiment life
Hacking intended convey two thing slogan
The first reaction unstable picture science come example Kuhn
Hacking suggests experimental result remain stable even face dramatic change part science
The second related point intended convey experiment organic develop change yet retain certain development make u talk repeating replicating experiment
Some technique simulationists use construct model get credentialed much way Hacking say instrument experimental procedure method credential develop extended period time become deeply
In Hacking language technique set assumption simulationists use become
Perhaps better expression would carry credential
This provides response problem posed understanding simulation could viable epistemology despite motley autonomous nature inference
Drawing inspiration another philosopher experiment Mayo Parker suggests remedy shortcoming current approach simulation model evaluation
In work Parker suggests Mayo approach understanding traditional make use notion severe test shed light epistemology simulation
The central question epistemology simulation perspective becomes What warrant taking computer simulation severe test hypothesis natural world
That warrant concluding simulation would unlikely give result fact gave hypothesis interest false
Parker belief much pass simulation model evaluation lack rigor structure Drawing explicitly upon Mayo work argues epistemology simulation ought instead offering account canonical error arise well strategy probing presence
Practitioners simulation particularly engineering context weapon testing climate science tend conceptualize EOCS term
said process determining whether output simulation approximates true solution differential equation original model
hand said process determining whether chosen model good enough representation system purpose simulation
The literature verification validation engineer scientist enormous beginning receive attention philosopher
Verification divided solution verification code verification
The former verifies output approximates true solution differential equation original model
The latter verifies code written carry intended algorithm
Code verification mostly ignored philosopher science probably seen problem computer science empirical mistake
Part solution verification consists comparing computed output analytic solution called benchmark solution
Though method course help make case result computer simulation since simulation often used precisely analytic solution unavailable region solution space interest
Other indirect technique available important probably checking see whether rate computed output converges stable solution time spatial resolution discretization grid get finer
The principal strategy validation involves comparing model output observable data
Again course strategy limited case simulation run observable data sparse
But complex strategy employed including comparing output subsystem simulation relevant experiment Parker forthcoming Oberkampf Roy
The concept verification validation drawn criticism philosopher
Oreskes et al
article mostly critical terminology arguing validity particular property applies logical argument hence term applied model might lead overconfidence
Winsberg argued conceptual division verification validation misleading taken suggest one set method show solved equation right another set method show got right equation
He also argued misleading think epistemology simulation cleanly divided empirical part verification mathematical computer science part validation
But misleading idea often follows discussion verification validation
We find work practitioner philosopher
Here standard line practictioner Roy Verification deal mathematics address correctness numerical solution given model
Validation hand deal physic address appropriateness model reproducing experimental data
Verification thought solving chosen equation correctly validation choosing correct equation first place Roy
Some philosopher put distinction work argument philosophical novelty simulation
We first raised issue section Frigg Reiss argued simulation could epistemologically novel feature since contained two distinct component component identical epistemology ordinary modeling component entirely mathematical
We distinguish two different notion reliability answering two different question
First solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful purely mathematical question fall within class problem mentioned
So nothing new philosophical point view question indeed one number crunching
Second computational model basis simulation represent target system correctly
That simulation result externally valid
This serious question one independent Ô¨Årst problem one equally arises connection model involve intractable mathematics ordinary experiment Frigg Reiss
But verification validation strictly speaking cleanly separable
That method validation much weak establish validity simulation
And model equation chosen simulation straightforward sense right equation model equation would choose ideal world
We good reason think word model equation enjoy better empirical support abstract
The equation choose often reflect compromise think best describes phenomenon computational tractability
So equation chosen rarely well validated
If want understand simulation result taken credible look epistemology simulation integrated whole cleanly divided verification would look inadequate task
So one point verification validation separable activity
But point two independent entity onto activity directed model chosen discretized method discretizing
Once one recognizes equation solved sometimes chosen cancel discretization error etc
Lenhard nice example involving Arakawa operator later distinction get harder maintain
So success achieved simulation kind piecemeal adjustment model method calculation
And case hard even know mean say simulation separately verified validated
No one argued V V useful distinction rather scientist overinflate pragmatically useful distinction clean methodological dictate misrepresents messiness practice
Collaterally Frigg Reiss argument absence epistemological novelty simulation fails reason
It purely mathematical question whether solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful
At least respect question answered pragmatic matter entirely using mathematical method
And hence issue arise ordinary modeling
Working scientist sometimes describe simulation study experimental term
The connection simulation experiment probably go back far von Neumann advocating early use computer physic noted many difficult experiment conducted merely determine fact ought principle derivable theory
Once von Neumann vision became reality experiment began replaced simulation became somewhat natural view version experiment
A representative passage found popular book simulation The idea silico experiment becomes even plausible simulation study designed learn happens system result various possible intervention What would happen global climate amount carbon added atmosphere
What happen airplane wing subjected strain
How would traffic pattern change onramp added location
Philosophers consequently begun consider sense computer simulation like experiment sense differ
A number view emerged literature centered around defending criticizing two thesis
Computer simulation study literally instance experiment

The identity thesis would true good reason weak version best reason stronger version reason strongest version necessary condition believe simulation provide warrant belief hypothesis support
A consequence strongest version identity thesis true reason believe simulation confer warrant believing hypothesis
The central idea behind epistemological dependence thesis experiment canonical entity play central role warranting belief scientific hypothesis therefore degree ought think simulation also play role warranting belief depends extent identified kind experiment
One find philosopher arguing identity thesis early Humphreys Hughes
And least implicit support stronger version epistemological dependence thesis Hughes
The earliest explicit argument favor epistemological dependence thesis however Norton Suppe
According Norton Suppe simulation warrant belief precisely literally experiment
They detailed story tell sense experiment supposed work
According Norton Suppe valid simulation one certain formal relation call realization hold base model modeled physical system computer running algorithm
When proper condition met simulation used instrument probing detecting real world phenomenon
Empirical data real phenomenon produced condition experimental control
One problem story formal condition set much strict
It unlikely many real example computer simulation meet strict standard
Simulation almost always far idealizing approximating enterprise
So simulation experiment probably way Norton Suppe imagined
More generally identity thesis drawn fire quarter
Gilbert Troitzsch argued major difference experiment one controlling actual object interest example chemistry experiment chemical investigation simulation one experimenting model rather phenomenon Gilbert Troitzsch
But seem right
Many Guala Morgan Parker Winsberg pointed problem claim
If Gilbert Troitzsch mean simulationists manipulate model sense abstract object claim difficult manipulate abstract entity
If hand simply mean point fact physical object simulationists digital actual object interest clear differs ordinary experiment
It false real experiment always manipulate exactly target interest
In fact real experiment simulation complex relationship manipulated investigation one hand system target investigation
In case experiment simulation therefore take argument substance establish external validity investigation establish learned system manipulated applicable system interest
Mendel example manipulated pea plant interested learning phenomenon heritability generally
The idea biology make idea perspicuous
We experiment interested understanding organism general use gene control development genealogy
We experiment provides useful model mutation genetic inheritance
But idea limited biology
Galileo experimented inclined plane interested object fall would behave absence interfering inclined plane experiment even actually instantiate
Of course view experiment uncontested
It true quite often experimentalists infer something system distinct system interfere
However clear whether inference proper part original experiment
Peschard mount criticism along line hence seen defender Gilbert Troitzsch
Peschard argues fundamental assumption experimentation simulation manipulated system standing target confused
It confuses Peshard argues experiment She argues epistemic motivation experiment might quite proper epistemic target experiment worm
In simulation according Peschard however epistemic target never digital computer
Thus simulation distinct experiment according epistemic target opposed merely epistemic motivation distinct object manipulated
Other opponent identity thesis include Giere Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources
It clear adjudicate dispute seems revolve primarily around difference emphasis
One emphasize experiment simulation following Gilbert Troitzsch Peschard insisting experiment teach u first epistemic target secondarily allow inference behavior system
experiment worm teach u first instance worm secondarily allow u make inference genetic control generally
This would make conceptually different computer simulation thought teach u first instance behavior computer second instance storm galaxy whatever
Or one emphasize opposite way
One emphasize degree experimental target always chosen surrogate really interest
Morrison probably forceful defender emphasizing aspect similarity experiment simulation
She argues experimental practice indeed measurement practice involve kind modeling practice simulation
In case pace Peschard nothing debate maybe appeal ordinary language use scientist always compelling kind prevent u saying epistemic target storm simulation computer storm merely epistemic motivation studying computer
Be may many philosopher simulation including discussed section chosen latter way drawing attention way message lurking behind Gilbert Troitzch quoted claim paint overly simplistic picture experiment
It seem overly simplistic paint picture according experiment get world whereas situation
And picture one seems get Gilber Troitzsch quotation
Peschard sophisticated picture involving distinction epistemic target epistemic motivation go long way towards smoothing concern without pushing u territory thinking simulation experiment regard
Still despite rejecting Gilbert characterization difference simulation experiment Guala Morgan reject identity thesis
Drawing work Simon Guala argues simulation differ fundamentally experiment object manipulation experiment bear material similarity target interest simulation similarity object target merely formal
Interestingly Morgan accepts argument identity thesis seems hold version
She argues word difference experiment simulation identified Guala implies simulation epistemologically inferior real experiment intrinsically le power warrant belief hypothesis real world experiment
A defense epistemic power simulation Morgan argument could come form defense identity thesis form rejection epistemological dependency thesis
On former front seem two problem Guala argument identity thesis
The first notion material similarity weak second notion mere formal similarity vague required work
Consider example fact uncommon engineering science use simulation method study behavior system fabricated silicon
The engineer want learn property different design possibility silicon device develops computational model device run simulation behavior digital computer
There deep material similarity material cause work central processor computer silicon device studied
On Gaula line reasoning mark example real experiment seems wrong
The peculiarity example illustrate problem rather starkly problem fact quite general two system bear material similarity difference
On flip side idea existence formal similarity two material entity could mark anything interesting conceptually confused
Given two sufficiently complex entity many way formally identical mention similar
There also way formally completely different
Now speak loosely say two thing bear formal similarity really mean best formal representation two entity formal similarity
In case appear good ground rejecting Gilbert Troitzsch Morgan Guala ground distinguishing experiment simulation
Returning defense epistemic power simulation also ground rejecting epistemological dependence thesis
As Parker point experiment simulation relevant similarity computer simulation target system matter
When relevant background knowledge place simulation provide reliable knowledge system experiment
A computer simulation solar system based sophisticated model celestial dynamic produce better representation planet orbit experiment
Paul Humphreys argued computer simulation profound implication understanding structure theory argues reveal inadequacy semantic syntactic view scientific theory
This claim drawn sharp fire Roman Frigg Julian Reiss
Frigg Reiss argue whether model admits analytic solution bearing relates world
They use example double pendulum show
Whether pendulum inner fulcrum held fixed fact determine whether relevant model analytically solvable bearing semantics element model
From conclude semantics model relates world unaffected whether model analytically solvable
This responsive however charitable reading Humphreys pointing
The syntactic semantic view theory account abstract scientific representation relate world
More particularly story relation particular model world rather relation world role model played relation
They also story lot say philosophically interesting action come scientific theorizing
The syntactic view suggested scientific practice could adequately rationally reconstructed thinking theory axiomatic system importantly logical deduction useful regulative ideal thinking inference theory world drawn
The syntactic view also omission made fairly clear modeling played anything role science
This feature syntactic view theory Frederick Suppe one ardent critic often railed
Theories nothing model theory could compared world without important role modeling play
The semantic view theory hand emphasize important role model also urged theory entity
It urged philosopher distracted contingency particular form linguistic expression theory might found say particular textbook
Computer simulation however seem illustrate theme misguided
It profoundly wrong think logical deduction right tool rationally reconstructing process theory application
Computer simulation show method theory application vastly outstrip inferential power logical deduction
The space solution example available via logical deduction theory fluid microscopic compared space application explored via computer simulation
On flip side computer simulation seem reveal Humphreys urged syntax matter
It wrong turn suggest semantic view particular linguistic form scientific theory expressed philosophically uninteresting
The syntax theory expression deep effect inference drawn kind idealization work well etc
Humphreys put point follows specific syntactic representation used often crucial solvability theory equation Humphreys
The theory fluid used emphasize point whether express theory Eulerian Lagrangian form deeply affect practice calculate affect idealization approximation calculational technique effective reliable circumstance
So epistemology computer simulation need sensitive particular syntactic formulation theory well particular formulation credentialed
Hence seem right emphasize Humphreys computer simulation revealed inadequacy syntactic semantic theory
Paul Humphreys Mark Bedau argued philosopher interested topic emergence learn great deal looking computer simulation
Philosophers interested topic consult entry contribution philosopher discussed
The connection emergence simulation perhaps best articulated Bedau
Bedau argued conception emergence must meet twin hallmark explaining whole depends part whole independent part
He argues philosopher often focus call strong emergence posit brute downward causation irreducible principle
But argues mistake
He focus instead call weak emergence reducibility whole part
Systems produce emergent property mere mechanism mechanism complex many independently interacting part
As result way figure exactly happen given specific set initial boundary condition except crawl causal web
It connection computer simulation arises
Weakly emergent property characteristic complex system nature
And also characteristic complex computer simulation way predict except let run
Weak emergence explains according Bedau computer simulation play central role science complex system
The best way understand predict real complex system behave simulate crawling web see happens
Models course involve idealization
But argued kind idealization play especially prominent role kind modeling involved computer simulation point deserve title This section discus attempt define fiction explore role computer simulation
There two different line thinking role fiction science
According one model fiction
This line thinking motivated considering role example ideal pendulum science
Scientists argued often make claim sort entity ideal pendulum period proportional length nowhere found real world hence must fictional entity
This line argument fictional entity science connect special way computer interested topic consult entry scientific representation forthcoming
Another line thinking fiction concerned question sort representation science ought regarded fictional
Here concern much ontology scientific model entity representational character various postulated model entity
Here Winsberg argued fiction special connection computer simulation
Or rather computer simulation contain element best typify might call fictional representation science even representation uniquely present simulation
He note first conception make representation contradicts reality fiction correspond ordinary use term rough map fiction
He proposes alternative definition nonfiction offered good enough guide part world fiction
But definition need refined
Take fable grasshopper ant
Although fable offer lesson world still fiction useful guide way world general sense rather specific guide way part world prima facie representational target singing grasshopper toiling ant
Nonfictions hand point certain part world guide part world
These kind fictional component model paradigmatically exemplified certain computer simulation
Two example silogen atom artificial Silogen atom appear certain nanomechanical model crack specie kind multiscale model blend quantum mechanic molecular mechanic mentioned section
The silogen containing model crack propagation silicon work describing crack using quantum mechanic region immediately surrounding crack using classical molecular dynamic
To bring together modeling framework two region boundary get treated contains silogen atom mixture property silicon hydrogen
Silogen atom fiction
They offered even good enough description atom prima facie representational target
But used overall model hoped get thing right
Thus overall model fiction one component
Artificial viscosity similar sort example
Fluids abrupt shock difficult model computational grid abrupt shock hide inside single grid cell resolved algorithm
Artificial viscosity technique pretend fluid highly shock shock becomes le abrupt blur several grid cell
Getting viscosity hence thickness shock wrong help get overall model work well Again overall model fluid fiction reliable enough guide behavior fluid
But component called artificial viscosity used reliably model shock
It incorporated larger modeling framework make larger framework reliable This account drawn two sort criticism
Toon argued definition fiction narrow
He give example historical fiction like argues fiction despite fact offered good enough guide people place event certain respect entitled take
Toon presumably support broader conception role fiction science according play particularly prominent heightened role computer simulation
Gordon Purves forthcoming argues example fiction computational model example imaginary crack elsewhere meet strict requirement discussed
Unlike Toon however also want delineate fictional modeling element one
His principal criticism criterion fictionhood term social norm Purves argues ought able settle whether piece modeling fiction absence norm
Thus want find intrinsic characterization scientific fiction
His proposal take constitutive model fiction fail characteristic Laymon called piecewise improvability PI
PI characteristic many model idealization say model becomes accurate
But silogen atom get accurate simulation silicon crack
But Purves take failure PI constitutive fiction rather merely symptomatic

However idea science evaluated alternative explanation compared evidence acceptance explanation ultimately assessment data reliable relevant decision explanation satisfactory
Thus knowing wrong answer wrong help secure deeper stronger understanding right answer right
Engaging argumentation evidence explanation support student understanding reason empirical evidence explanation demonstrating science body knowledge rooted evidence
One helpful way understanding practice scientist engineer frame work done three sphere activity shown
In one sphere dominant activity investigation empirical inquiry
In second essence work construction explanation design using reasoning creative thinking model
And third sphere idea fit model explanation evidence appropriateness product design analyzed debated evaluated
In three sphere The three sphere activity scientist engineer
activity scientist engineer try use best available tool support task hand today mean modern computational technology integral virtually aspect work
At left figure activity related empirical investigation
In sphere activity scientist determine need measured observe phenomenon plan experiment program observation method data collection build instrument engage disciplined fieldwork identify source uncertainty
For part engineer engage testing contribute data informing proposed design
A civil engineer example design new highway without measuring terrain collecting data nature soil water flow
The activity related developing explanation solution shown right figure
For scientist work sphere activity draw established theory model propose extension theory create new model
Often develop model hypothesis lead new question investigate alternative explanation consider
For engineer major practice production design
Design development also involves constructing model example computer simulation new structure process may used test design range simulated condition later stage test physical prototype
Both scientist engineer use sketch diagram mathematical relationship simulation physical make prediction likely behavior system collect data evaluate prediction possibly revise model result
Between within two sphere activity practice evaluation represented middle space
Here iterative process repeat every step work
Critical thinking required whether developing refining idea explanation design conducting investigation
The dominant activity sphere argumentation critique often lead experiment observation change proposed model explanation design
Scientists engineer use argumentation make case idea whether involving new theory design novel way collecting data interpretation evidence
They peer attempt identify weakness limitation argument ultimate goal refining improving explanation design
In reality scientist engineer move fluidly iteratively back forth among three sphere activity conduct activity might involve two even three mode
The function therefore solely offer scheme help identify function significance range diversity practice embedded work scientist engineer
Although admittedly simplification figure identify three overarching category practice show interact
Engineering science similar involve creative process neither us one method
And scientific investigation defined different way engineering design described various way
However widespread agreement broad outline engineering design process
Like scientific investigation engineering design iterative systematic
It iterative new version design tested modified based learned point
It systematic number characteristic step must undertaken
One step identifying problem defining specification constraint
Another step generating idea solve problem engineer often use research group session brainstorming come range solution design alternative development
Yet another step testing potential solution building testing physical mathematical model prototype provide valuable data obtained way
With data hand engineer analyze well various solution meet given specification constraint evaluate needed improve leading design devise better one
In contrast scientific study may may driven immediate practical application
On one hand certain kind scientific research led Pasteur fundamental contribution germ theory disease undertaken practical purpose resulted important new technology including vaccination anthrax rabies pasteurization milk prevent spoilage
On hand many scientific study search planet orbiting distant star driven curiosity undertaken aim answering question world understanding Students opportunity immerse practice explore central science engineering critical appreciating skill expert nature enterprise
observed pattern
For science developing explanation constitutes success regardless whether immediate practical application goal science develop set coherent mutually consistent theoretical description world provide explanation wide range phenomenon For engineering however success measured extent human need want addressed
Both scientist engineer engage argumentation different goal
In engineering goal argumentation evaluate prospective design produce effective design meeting specification constraint
This optimization process typically involves competing goal consequence never one correct solution design challenge
Instead number possible solution choosing among inevitably involves personal well technical cost consideration
Moreover continual arrival new technology enables new solution
In contrast theory science must meet different set criterion parsimony preference simpler solution explanatory coherence essentially well new theory provides explanation phenomenon fit observation allow prediction inference past made
Moreover aim science find single coherent comprehensive theory range related phenomenon
Multiple competing explanation regarded unsatisfactory possible contradiction contain must resolved data enable either selection best available explanation development new comprehensive theory phenomenon question
Although expect student able develop new scientific theory expect develop model argue using conjunction evidence observation develop explanation
Indeed developing model argument explanation key developing demonstrating understanding accepted scientific viewpoint
A focus practice plural avoids mistaken impression one distinctive approach common single scientific The practice described chapter derived scientist engineer actually engage part work
We recognize student reach level competence professional scientist engineer novice violinist expected attain ability virtuoso
Yet student opportunity immerse practice explore central science engineering critical appreciating skill expert nature enterprise
We consider eight practice essential element science engineering curriculum
Asking question science defining problem engineering
Developing using model
Planning carrying investigation
Analyzing interpreting data

BOX Practice Questions engine drive science engineering
Science asks What exists happens
Why happen
How one know
Engineering asks What done address particular human need want
How need better specified
What tool technology available could developed addressing need
Both science engineering ask How one communicate phenomenon evidence explanation design solution
Asking question essential developing scientific habit mind
Even individual become scientist engineer ability ask question important component science literacy helping make critical consumer scientific knowledge
Scientific question arise variety way
They driven curiosity world Why sky blue
They inspired model theory prediction attempt extend refine model theory How particle model matter explain incompressibility liquid
Or result need provide better solution problem
For example question impossible siphon water height foot led Evangelista Torricelli inventor barometer discovery atmosphere identification vacuum
Questions also important engineering
Engineers must able ask probing question order define engineering problem
For example may ask What need desire underlies problem
What criterion specification successful solution
What constraint
Other question arise generating possible solution Will solution meet design criterion
Can two idea combined produce better solution
Students grade level able ask question text read feature phenomenon observe conclusion draw model scientific investigation
What possible
And question arise testing solution Which idea tested
What evidence needed show idea optimal given constraint
The experience learning science engineering therefore develop student ability indeed encourage question investigated empirically
Students also need recognize distinction question answered empirically answerable domain knowledge human experience
GOALS By grade student able Ask question natural example Why season
What bee
Why structure collapse
How electric power generated
Distinguish scientific question Why helium balloon rise
nonscientific question Which colored balloon prettiest
Formulate refine question answered empirically science classroom use design inquiry construct pragmatic solution
Ask probing question seek identify premise argument request elaboration refine research question engineering problem challenge interpretation data example How know
What evidence support argument
Note feature pattern contradiction observation ask question
For engineering ask question need desire met order define constraint specification solution
PROGRESSION Students grade level able ask question text read feature phenomenon observe conclusion draw model scientific investigation
For engineering ask question define problem solved elicit idea lead constraint specification solution
As progress across grade question become relevant focused sophisticated
Facilitating evolution require classroom culture respect value good question offer student opportunity refine question questioning strategy incorporates teaching effective questioning strategy across grade level
As result student become increasingly proficient posing question request relevant empirical evidence seek refine model explanation engineering problem challenge premise argument suitability design
Practice Scientists construct mental conceptual model phenomenon
Mental model internal personal idiosyncratic incomplete unstable essentially functional
They serve purpose tool thinking making prediction making sense experience
Conceptual model focus section contrast explicit representation way analogous phenomenon represent
Conceptual model allow scientist engineer better visualize understand phenomenon investigation develop possible solution design problem
Used science engineering either structural functional behavioral analog albeit simplified conceptual model include diagram physical replica mathematical representation analogy computer simulation
Although correspond exactly complicated entity modeled bring certain feature focus minimizing obscuring others
Because model contain approximation assumption limit range validity application precision predictive power important recognize limitation
Conceptual model sens external articulation mental model scientist hold strongly interrelated mental model
Building understanding model role science help student construct revise mental model phenomenon
Better mental model turn lead deeper understanding science enhanced scientific reasoning
Scientists use model sake simplicity use term model refer conceptual model rather mental model represent current understanding system part system study aid development question explanation communicate idea others
Some model used scientist mathematical example ideal gas law equation derived model gas set point mass engaged perfectly elastic collision wall simplified model based atomic theory matter
For complex system mathematical representation physical system used create computer simulation enable scientist predict behavior otherwise intractable example effect increasing atmospheric level carbon dioxide agriculture different region world
Models evaluated refined iterative cycle comparing prediction real world adjusting thereby potentially yielding insight phenomenon modeled
Engineering make use model analyze existing system allows engineer see condition flaw might develop test possible solution new problem
Engineers also use model visualize design take higher level refinement communicate design feature others prototype testing design performance
Models particularly modern computer simulation encode relevant physical law property material especially helpful realizing testing design structure building bridge aircraft expensive construct must survive extreme condition occur rare occasion
Other type engineering problem also benefit use specialized simulation design testing phase
But science engineer use model must aware intrinsic limitation test known situation ensure reliable
GOALS By grade student able Construct drawing diagram representation event example draw picture insect labeled feature represent happens water puddle warmed sun represent simple physical model object use basis explanation make prediction system behave specified circumstance
Represent explain phenomenon multiple type example represent molecule model bond move flexibly model type different one useful different purpose
Discuss limitation precision model representation system process design suggest way model might improved better fit available evidence better reflect design specification
Refine model light empirical evidence criticism improve quality explanatory power
Use provided computer simulation simulation developed simple simulation tool tool understanding investigating aspect system particularly readily visible naked eye
Make use model test design aspect design compare effectiveness different design solution
PROGRESSION Modeling begin earliest grade student model progressing concrete picture physical scale model toy car abstract representation relevant relationship later grade diagram representing force particular object system
Students asked use diagram map abstract model tool enable elaborate idea finding present others
Young student encouraged devise pictorial simple graphical representation finding investigation use model developing explanation occurred
More sophisticated type model increasingly used across grade instruction curriculum material student progress science education
The quality model highly dependent prior knowledge skill also student understanding system modeled student expected refine model understanding develops
Curricula need stress role model explicitly provide student modeling tool modeling NetLogo spreadsheet model student come value core practice develop level facility constructing applying appropriate model
Practice Scientists engineer investigate observe world essentially two goal systematically describe world develop test theory explanation world work
In first careful observation description often lead identification feature need explained question need explored
The second goal requires investigation test explanatory model world prediction whether inference suggested model supported data
Planning designing investigation require ability design experimental observational inquiry appropriate answering question asked testing hypothesis formed
This process begin identifying relevant variable considering might observed measured controlled constrained experimental design take particular value
Planning control important part design investigation
In laboratory experiment critical decide variable treated result output thus left vary treated input condition hence controlled
In many case particularly case field observation planning involves deciding controlled collect different sample data different condition even though condition direct control investigator
Decisions must also made measurement taken level accuracy required kind instrumentation best suited making measurement
As form inquiry key issue one goal measure variable accurately possible reduce source error
The investigator must therefore decide constitutes sufficient level precision technique used reduce random systematic error
GOALS By grade student able Formulate question investigated within scope classroom school laboratory field available resource appropriate frame hypothesis possible explanation predicts particular stable outcome based model theory
Decide data gathered tool needed gathering measurement recorded
Decide much data needed produce reliable measurement consider limitation precision data
Plan experimental procedure identifying relevant independent dependent variable appropriate need control
Consider possible confounding variable effect ensure investigation design controlled
PROGRESSION Students need opportunity design investigation learn importance decision measure keep constant select construct data collection instrument appropriate need inquiry
They also need experience help recognize laboratory sole domain legitimate scientific inquiry many scientist earth scientist ethologist ecologist laboratory natural world experiment conducted data collected field
In elementary year student experience structured help learn define feature investigated pattern suggest causal relationship What feature ramp affect speed given ball leaf ramp
The plan investigation trial make record information need refined iteratively student recognize experience limitation original plan
These investigation enriched extended linking engineering design example student apply learned ramp design track make ball travel given distance go around loop stop uphill slope
From earliest grade student opportunity carry careful systematic investigation appropriately supported prior experience develop ability observe measure record data using appropriate tool instrument
Students opportunity plan carry several different kind investigation year
At level engage investigation range structured order expose issue question would unlikely explore measuring specific property material emerge student question
As become sophisticated student also opportunity identify question researched also decide data gathered variable controlled tool instrument needed gather record data appropriate format eventually consider incorporate measurement error analyzing data
Older student asked develop hypothesis predicts particular stable outcome explain reasoning justify choice
By high school hypothesis based model theory
In addition student able recognize always possible control variable method used example looking correlation understanding correlation necessarily imply causality
Practice Once collected data must presented form reveal pattern relationship allows result communicated others
Because raw data little meaning major practice scientist organize interpret data tabulating graphing statistical analysis
Such analysis bring meaning may used evidence
Once collected data must presented form reveal pattern relationship allows result communicated others
Engineers make decision based evidence given design work rarely rely trial error
Engineers often analyze design creating model prototype collecting extensive data performs including extreme condition
Analysis kind data informs design decision enables prediction assessment performance also help define clarify problem determine economic feasibility evaluate alternative investigate failure
Spreadsheets database provide useful way organizing data especially large data set
The identification relationship data aided range tool including table graph mathematics
Tables permit major feature large body data summarized conveniently accessible form graph offer mean visually summarizing data mathematics essential expressing relationship different variable data set see discussion mathematics
Modern visualization tool often allow data displayed varied form thus learner engage interactively data analysis
In addition standard statistical technique help reduce effect error relating one variable another
Students need opportunity analyze large data set identify correlation
Increasingly data temperature pollution level scientific available Internet
Moreover information technology enables capture data beyond classroom hour day
Such data set extend range student experience help illuminate important practice analyzing interpreting data
GOALS By grade student able Analyze data systematically either look salient pattern test whether data consistent initial hypothesis
Recognize data conflict expectation consider revision initial model needed
Use spreadsheet database table chart graph statistic mathematics information computer technology collate summarize display data explore relationship variable especially representing input output
Evaluate strength conclusion inferred data set using appropriate mathematical statistical technique
Recognize pattern data suggest relationship worth investigating
Distinguish causal correlational relationship
Collect data physical model analyze performance design range condition
PROGRESSION At elementary level student need support recognize need record drawing word share others
As engage scientific inquiry deeply begin collect categorical numerical data presentation form facilitate interpretation table graph
When feasible computer digital tool introduced mean enabling practice
In middle school student opportunity learn standard technique displaying analyzing interpreting data technique include different type graph identification outlier data set averaging reduce effect measurement error
Students also asked explain technique needed
As student progress various science class high school investigation become complex need develop skill additional technique displaying analyzing data scatterplots express relationship two variable
Students helped recognize may need explore one way display data order identify present significant feature
They also need opportunity use mathematics statistic analyze feature data covariation
Also high school level student opportunity use greater diversity sample scientific data use computer digital tool support kind analysis
Students expected use technique engineering well
When important made cognizant purpose data collect analyze intended help validate improve design decide optimal solution
Practice Mathematics computational tool central science engineering
Mathematics enables numerical representation variable symbolic representation relationship physical entity prediction outcome
Mathematics provides powerful model describing predicting phenomenon atomic structure gravitational force quantum mechanic
Since century computational theory information computer technology algorithm revolutionized virtually scientific engineering field
These tool strategy allow scientist engineer collect analyze large data set search distinctive pattern identify relationship significant feature way previously impossible
They also provide powerful new technique employing mathematics model complex example circulation carbon dioxide atmosphere ocean
Mathematics computation powerful tool brought bear scientific investigation
Mathematics serf pragmatic function communicative function one language science structural function allows logical deduction
Mathematics enables idea expressed precise form enables identification new idea physical world
For example concept equivalence mass energy emerged mathematical analysis conducted Einstein based premise special relativity
The contemporary understanding electromagnetic wave emerged Maxwell mathematical analysis behavior electric magnetic field
Modern theoretical physic heavily imbued mathematics would make sense try divide mathematical nonmathematical part
In much modern science prediction inference probabilistic nature understanding mathematics probability statistically derived inference important part understanding science
Computational tool enhance power mathematics enabling calculation carried analytically
For example allow development simulation combine mathematical representation Increasing student familiarity role mathematics science central developing deeper understanding science work
multiple underlying phenomenon model dynamic complex system
Computational method also potent tool visually representing data show result calculation simulation way allow exploration pattern
Engineering involves mathematical computational skill
For example structural engineer create mathematical model bridge building design based physical law test performance probe structural limit ass whether completed within acceptable budget
Virtually engineering design raise issue require computation resolution
Although difference mathematics computational thinking applied science engineering mathematics often brings two field together enabling engineer apply mathematical form scientific theory enabling scientist use powerful information technology designed engineer
Both kind professional thereby accomplish investigation analysis build complex model might otherwise question
Mathematics including statistic computational tool essential data analysis especially large data set
The ability view data different perspective different graphical representation test relationship variable explore interplay diverse external condition require mathematical skill enhanced extended computational skill
GOALS By grade student able Recognize dimensional quantity use appropriate unit scientific application mathematical formula graph
Express relationship quantity appropriate mathematical algorithmic form scientific modeling investigation
Recognize computer simulation built mathematical model incorporate underlying assumption phenomenon system studied
Use simple test case mathematical expression computer program compare outcome known real see make Use understanding mathematics statistic analyzing data
PROGRESSION Increasing student familiarity role mathematics science central developing deeper understanding science work
As soon student learn count begin using number find describe pattern nature
At appropriate grade level learn use instrument ruler protractor thermometer measurement variable best represented continuous numerical scale apply mathematics interpolate value identify maximum minimum range average simple data set
A significant advance come relationship expressed using equality first word algebraic example shifting distance traveled equal velocity multiplied time elapsed
Students opportunity explore symbolic representation used represent data predict outcome eventually derive relationship using mathematics
Students gain experience using computer record measurement taken probe instrument thereby recognizing process allows multiple measurement made rapidly recurrently
Likewise student gain experience using computer program transform data various tabular graphical form thereby aiding identification pattern
Students thus encouraged explore use computer data analysis using simple data set early age
For example could use spreadsheet record data perform simple recurring calculation data calculation average speed measurement position multiple time
Later work introduce use mathematical relationship build simple computer model using appropriate supporting program information computer technology tool
As student progress understanding mathematics computation every level science classroom place tool progressively exploited
Practice Because science seek enhance human understanding world scientific theory developed provide explanation aimed illuminating nature particular phenomenon predicting future event making inference past event
Science developed explanatory theory germ theory disease Big Bang theory origin universe Darwin theory evolution specie
Although role often informal use word theory mean theory construct based significant body knowledge evidence revised light new evidence must withstand significant scrutiny scientific community widely accepted applied
Theories mere guess especially valued provide explanation multiple instance
In science term hypothesis also used differently everyday language
A scientific hypothesis neither scientific theory guess plausible explanation observed phenomenon predict happen given situation
A hypothesis made based existing theoretical understanding relevant situation often also specific model system question
Scientific explanation account link scientific theory specific observation example explain observed relationship variable describe mechanism support cause effect inference
Very often theory first represented specific model situation question explanation developed
For example one understands theory oxygen obtained transported utilized body model circulatory system developed used explain heart rate breathing rate increase exercise
Scientific theory developed provide explanation aimed illuminating nature particular phenomenon predicting future event making inference past event
Engaging student standard scientific explanation gain understanding major idea science central aspect science education
Asking student demonstrate understanding implication scientific idea developing explanation phenomenon whether based observation made model developed engages essential part process conceptual change occur
Explanations science natural pedagogical us given inherent appeal simplicity analogy empirical data may even form thought experiment
And explanation especially valuable classroom rather spite fact often competing explanation offered example recent gradual rise mean surface temperature Earth
Deciding best explanation matter argument resolved well given explanation fit available data much simplifies would seem complex whether produce sense understanding
Because scientist achieve understanding building theory explanation aid model representation drawing data evidence student also develop facility constructing explanation
This essential step building understanding phenomenon gaining greater appreciation explanatory power scientific theory learning class acquiring greater insight scientist operate
In engineering goal design rather explanation
The process developing design iterative systematic process developing explanation theory science
Engineers activity however element distinct scientist
These element include specifying constraint criterion desired quality solution developing design plan producing testing model prototype selecting among alternative design feature optimize achievement design criterion refining design idea based performance prototype simulation
GOALS By grade student able Construct explanation phenomenon using knowledge accepted scientific theory linking model evidence
Use primary secondary scientific evidence model support refute explanatory account phenomenon
Offer causal explanation appropriate level scientific knowledge
Identify gap weakness explanatory account others
In experience engineering student opportunity Solve design problem appropriately applying scientific knowledge
Undertake design project engaging step design cycle producing plan meet specific design criterion
Construct device implement design solution
Evaluate critique competing design solution based jointly developed design criterion
PROGRESSION FOR EXPLANATION Early science education student need opportunity engage constructing critiquing explanation
They encouraged develop explanation observe conducting investigation evaluate others explanation consistency evidence
For example observation owl pellet dissect lead produce explanation owl eating habit based inference made find
As student knowledge develops begin identify isolate variable incorporate resulting observation explanation phenomenon
Using measurement one factor affect another develop causal account explain observe
For example investigating condition plant grow fastest may notice plant die kept dark seek develop explanation finding
Although explanation level may simple plant die dark need light order live grow provides basis question deeper understanding plant utilize light developed later grade
On basis comparison explanation observation student appreciate explanation plant need light grow fails explain die water provided
They encouraged revisit initial idea produce complete explanation account observation
By middle grade student recognize many explanation science rely model representation entity small see large visualize
For example explaining temperature water increase beyond heated requires student envisage water consisting microscopic particle energy provided heating allow particle escape despite force attraction holding particle together
In later stage education student also progress using mathematics simulation construct explanation phenomenon
PROGRESSION FOR DESIGN In way child natural engineer
They spontaneously build sand castle dollhouse hamster enclosure use variety tool material playful purpose
Thus common elementary school activity challenge child use tool material provided class solve specific challenge constructing bridge paper tape testing failure occurs
Children capability design structure enhanced pay attention point failure asking create test redesigns bridge stronger
Furthermore design activity limited structural engineering also include project reflect area engineering need design traffic pattern school parking lot layout planting school garden box
In middle school especially beneficial engage student engineering design project expected apply recently learned example using concept ecology solve problem related school garden
Middle school student also opportunity plan carry full engineering design project define problem term criterion constraint research problem deepen relevant knowledge generate test possible solution refine solution redesign
At high school level student undertake complex engineering design project related major local national global issue
Increased emphasis placed researching nature given problem reviewing others proposed solution weighing strength weakness various alternative discerning possibly unanticipated effect
Practice Whether concern new theory proposed explanation phenomenon novel solution technological problem fresh interpretation old data scientist engineer use reasoning argumentation make case
In science production knowledge dependent process reasoning requires scientist make justified claim world
In response scientist attempt identify claim weakness limitation
Their argument based deduction premise inductive generalization existing pattern inference best possible explanation
Argumentation also needed resolve question involving example best experimental design appropriate technique data analysis best interpretation given data set
In short science replete argument take place informally lab meeting symposium formally peer review
Historical case study origin development scientific idea show new idea often difficult accept argued example Copernican idea Earth travel around sun Darwin idea origin specie
Over time idea survive critical examination even light new data attain consensual acceptance community process discourse argument science maintains objectivity progress
The knowledge ability detect bad science requirement scientist citizen
Scientists must make critical judgment work peer scientist citizen alike must make evaluative judgment validity medium report implication people life society
Becoming critical consumer science fostered opportunity use critique evaluation judge merit scientifically based argument
In engineering reasoning argument essential finding best possible solution problem
At early design stage competing idea must compared possibly combined achieve initial design choice made argumentation merit various idea pertinent design goal
At later stage design process engineer test potential solution collect data modify design iterative manner
The result effort often presented evidence argue strength weakness particular design
Although form argumentation similar criterion employed engineering often quite different science
For example engineer might use analysis analysis risk appeal aesthetic prediction market reception justify one design better entirely different course action followed
GOALS By grade student able Construct scientific argument showing data support claim
Identify possible weakness scientific argument appropriate student level knowledge discus using reasoning evidence
Identify flaw argument modify improve response criticism
Recognize major feature scientific argument claim data reason distinguish element example
Explain nature controversy development given scientific idea describe debate surrounded inception indicate one particular theory succeeded
Explain claim knowledge judged scientific community today articulate merit limitation peer review need independent replication critical investigation
Read medium report science technology critical manner identify strength weakness
PROGRESSION The study science engineering produce sense process argument necessary advancing defending new idea explanation phenomenon norm conducting argument
In spirit student argue explanation construct defend interpretation associated data advocate design propose
Meanwhile learn evaluate critically scientific argument others present counterargument
Learning argue scientifically offer student opportunity use scientific knowledge justifying explanation identifying weakness others argument also build knowledge understanding
Constructing critiquing argument core process science one support science education research suggests interaction others cognitively effective way learning
Young student begin constructing argument interpretation phenomenon observe data collect
They need instructional support go beyond simply making include reason reference evidence begin distinguish evidence opinion
As grow ability construct scientific argument student draw wider range reason evidence argument become sophisticated
In addition expected discern aspect evidence potentially significant supporting refuting particular argument
Students begin learning critique asking question finding others
Later expected identify possible weakness either data argument explain criticism justified
As become adept arguing critiquing introduced language needed talk argument claim reason data etc
Exploration historical episode science provide opportunity student identify idea evidence argument professional scientist
In encouraged recognize criterion used judge claim new knowledge formal mean scientific idea evaluated today
In particular see practice peer review independent verification claimed experimental result help maintain objectivity trust science
Practice Being literate science engineering requires ability read understand literature
Science engineering way knowing represented communicated word diagram chart graph image symbol mathematics
Reading interpreting producing text fundamental practice science particular constitute least half engineer scientist total working time
Even student developed reading skill reading science often challenging student three reason
First jargon science text essentially unfamiliar together often extensive use example passive voice complex sentence structure many find text inaccessible
Second science text must read extract information accurately
Because precise meaning word clause may important text require mode reading quite different reading novel even newspaper
Third science text multimodal using mix word diagram chart symbol mathematics communicate
Thus understanding science text requires much simply knowing meaning technical term
Communicating written spoken form another fundamental practice science requires scientist describe observation precisely clarify thinking justify argument
Because writing one primary mean communicating The term text used refer form communication printed text video production
scientific community learning produce scientific text essential developing understanding science learning draw appreciating skill visual artist
Indeed new recognize reading writing skill essential science formal inclusion framework science practice reinforces expands view
Science simply advance scientist unable communicate finding clearly persuasively
Communication occurs variety formal venue including journal book conference presentation carefully constructed website occurs well informal mean discussion email message phone call blog
New technology extended communicative practice enabling multidisciplinary collaboration across globe place even emphasis reading writing
Increasingly scientist required engage dialogue lay audience work requires especially good communication skill
Being critical consumer science product engineering whether lay citizen practicing scientist engineer also requires ability read view report science press Internet recognize salient science identify source error methodological flaw distinguish observation inference argument explanation claim evidence
All construct learned engaging critical discourse around text
Engineering proceeds similar manner engineer need communicate idea find exchange example new technique new us existing tool material
As science engineering communication involves written spoken language many engineering idea best communicated sketch diagram graph model product
Also wide use handbook specific particular engineering field provide detailed information often tabular form best formulate design solution commonly encountered engineering task
Knowing seek use informational resource important part engineer skill set
GOALS By grade student able Use word table diagram graph whether hard copy electronically well mathematical expression communicate understanding ask question system study
Read scientific engineering text including table diagram graph commensurate scientific knowledge explain key idea communicated
Recognize major feature scientific engineering writing speaking able produce written illustrated text oral presentation communicate idea accomplishment
Engage critical reading primary scientific literature adapted classroom use medium report science discus validity reliability data hypothesis conclusion
PROGRESSION Any education science engineering need develop student ability read produce text
As every science engineering lesson part language lesson particularly reading producing genre text intrinsic science engineering
Students need sustained practice support develop ability extract meaning scientific text book medium report form scientific communication form text initially rather narrative often linguistically dense reliant precise logical flow
Students able interpret meaning text produce text written language diagram used express scientific idea engage extended discussion idea
From start science education student asked engage communication science especially regarding investigation conducting observation making
Careful description observation clear statement idea ability refine statement response question ask question others achieve clarification said begin earliest grade
Beginning upper elementary middle school ability interpret written material becomes important
Early work reading science text also include explicit instruction practice interpreting table diagram chart coordinating information conveyed information written text
Throughout science education student continually introduced new term meaning term learned opportunity use apply specific context
Not must student learn technical term also general academic language analyze correlation part student everyday vocabulary thus need specific elaboration make sense From start science education student asked engage communication science especially regarding investigation conducting observation making
scientific text
It follows master reading scientific material student need opportunity engage text identify major feature expected simply apply reading skill learned elsewhere master unfamiliar genre effectively
Students write account work using journal record observation thought idea model
They encouraged create diagram represent data observation plot table well written text journal
They also begin produce report poster present work others
As student begin read write text particular genre scientific report investigation explanation supporting argumentation experimental need introduced purpose explored
Furthermore student opportunity engage discussion observation explanation make oral presentation result conclusion well engage appropriate discourse student asking question discussing issue raised presentation
Because spoken language discussion presentation far everyday language scientific text novel development written spoken scientific need proceed parallel
In high school practice developed providing student complex text wider range text material technical report scientific literature Internet
Moreover student need opportunity read discus general medium report critical eye read appropriate sample adapted primary literature begin seeing science communicated science practitioner
In engineering student likewise need opportunity communicate idea using appropriate combination sketch model language
They also create drawing test concept communicate detailed plan explain critique model various sort including scale model prototype present result simulation regarding planning development stage also make compelling presentation ultimate solution
Science enormously successful extending humanity knowledge world indeed transforming
Understanding science achieved success technique us essential part science education
Although universal agreement teaching nature science strong consensus characteristic scientific enterprise understood educated citizen
For example notion single scientific method observation hypothesis deduction myth perpetuated day many fundamentally wrong
Scientists use deductive reasoning also search pattern classify different object make generalization repeated observation engage process making inference might best explanation
Thus picture scientific reasoning richer complex diverse image linear unitary scientific method would suggest
What engages scientist however process critique argumentation
Because examine idea look flaw controversy debate among scientist normal occurrence neither exceptional extraordinary
Moreover science established formal mechanism peer review establishing credibility individual scientist work
The idea survive process review criticism one become well established scientific community
Our view opportunity student learn basic set practice outlined chapter also opportunity stand back reflect practice contribute accumulation scientific knowledge
For example student need see construction model major mean acquiring new understanding model identify key feature akin map rather literal representation reality great achievement science core set explanatory theory wide application
Understanding science function requires synthesis content knowledge procedural knowledge epistemic knowledge
Procedural knowledge refers method scientist use ensure finding valid reliable
It includes understanding importance appropriate use control trial procedure method reduce error used science
As much specific domain learned within science
Procedural knowledge also called concept evidence
Epistemic knowledge knowledge construct value intrinsic science
Students need understand meant example observation hypothesis inference model theory claim able readily distinguish
An education science show new scientific idea act imagination commonly created day collaborative effort group scientist whose critique argument fundamental establishing idea worthy pursuing
Ideas often survive coherent already known either explain unexplained explain observation explain simpler elegant manner
Science replete idea seemed promising withstood test time concept ether vital force life
Thus new idea initially tentative time survives repeated testing acquire status piece knowledge unquestioned uncontested existence atom
Scientists use resulting theory model represent explain predict causal relationship
When theory well tested prediction reliable permitting application science technology wide variety policy decision
In word science miscellany fact coherent body knowledge hard serf powerful tool
Engagement modeling critical argumentation invite encourages student reflect status knowledge understanding science work
And involve practice science come appreciate basic nature level sophistication understanding given practice contributes scientific enterprise continue develop across grade level

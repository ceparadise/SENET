submitted Hello I BS physic
I entered gradschool dropped
So I coursework PhD thesis I still study keep math skill
I really want go data science I kind break give bit time retrain
I taking course c get certificate
However I want continue training
I considering signing Udacity cost money I afford I know benefit worth
I starting map project I build portfolio recruiter idea mentor tempting
I terribly worried someone help complete course even project however appears give project relevant
I would like opinion
While I really good learning difficult math technology programming I terrible actually applying carreer
Post comment
Before choose understand kind certification degree pretty much worthless hiring standpoint
Their value actually gain useful hopefully demonstrable knowledge experience
Alternatively data science probably probably one largest area free material book paper video lecture tutorial etc internet
As project data science advantage many open competition site like Kaggle work real project real data well certainly help finding data science job
Some company automatically extend offer top winner sponsored competition
You also contribute many open source package language like Python make fun project using incredible amount data image document social network available internet
In end though Udacity prevent using aforementioned thing either feel like need bit structure might help give nice introduction overview lot area
thanks awesome response
I consider
Besides Kaggle way think project
I already project indie game
Not I shortage project work I like dabble free time area really relate company like NLP Computer Vision
There plenty new paper reddit post new technique fun play around see well work different data set
Beyond personal project fun thing I
Try building model organize photo music collection
Or use Topic Models subreddits see idea core group one related
Or create semantic analysis tool look tweet near locates party potential crime
Another important thing build RSS feed really good blog topic
With solid list see kind creative analysis done might inspire something
I recommend want though google search turn
Yes recommend please
D This exciting
First let point ton information course book contest data set etc As RSS feed list rather large I mention couple
My personal favorite done actuarial professor sometimes post French
He post called Somewhere Else time week list thing found interesting really great
Beyond I quickly grabbed get started Honestly log onto feedly search machine learning data science recommend bunch popular one
Ack I still question I curious fellow
The Claims train Junior Data scientist ground
But I wonder would position I think idea data analyst
Vs top tier rockstar Data Scientist develops new algorithm
I say UDacity program seems little bit good true
I know strong demand type job I think far fetched even without degree could fill
Then perspective I degree physic math statistic training I seem leg
Still got ta put work however
Ok final question
Do higher level position care data science research could research
I working paper dark matter also quantum computing I went adventure
If I could publish area would help carreer
People actually want use quantum computer machine learning since possibly solve NP hard problem
We far one though
If PhD Physics focus related area something working along decent skill programming statistic could find place data science research team
My team actually couple people PhDs traditional science generally code R know basic statistic know much machine learning
For Bachelor degree certainly hurt still major leap full research team without graduate school

In project design control program microprocessor colony NANORGs virtual world
This project adapted Symantec University Programming Contest Symantec kind permission
Edited Andrew Olson Science Buddies This Science Buddies project adapted permission Symantec University Programming Competition
It feature fun software engineering challenge write assembly language program harvest energy virtual world
Assembly language programming force think level microprocessor
Your code work level single word memory register CPU fundamental processor instruction
Assembly language programming give insight computer actually work
This help make better programmer language
This project requires previous experience assembly language programming previous experience programming language BASIC C willingness learn assembly language programming
Your goal project program NANORGs extract energy industrial sludge found random location virtual world
The extracted energy must delivered special collection point NANORGs must locate
Note NANORGs also require energy operation
Two additional problem complicate task
Here scenario detail
The year well
The world accelerating consumption oil largely depleted world reserve oil leading mass shortage
Scientists engineer around world looking environmentally safe cheap alternative oil
The problem become large opportunity immense Symantec decided direct division try tackle energy problem
You hired Symantec Division work new programmable NANORG capable converting industrial sludge renewable energy source
Symantec already developed proper hardware extract energy sludge need write control logic NANORG CPU make efficient possible harvesting energy
Of course organism function must use portion energy generates operation need balance energy need goal outputting much energy possible
Once written control program test NANORGs perform virtual world
In simulation fifty NANORG clone containing logic dropped large tank sludge must consume sludge release energy special collection point tank
Obviously NANORG produce energy allotted time commercialized Symantec job project produce efficient organism possible
Unfortunately addition converting sludge electricity organism must also confront several challenge
First sludge contaminated radioactive chemical eating sludge cause NANORG undergo small mutation programming logic
Second concerning organism must deal earlier generation malicious NANORGs also present within sludge tank
These organism called drone written spy sabotage Symantec Division based exact hardware machine language instruction set NANORGs
However programming logic intentionally designed harmful
While also consume sludge produce energy output
Moreover come direct contact foreign organism may attempt spread logic copying adjacent organism mutating logic become one
Your NANORG logic must cope challenge
The project includes ZIP file download material need project see Materials Equipment section
The ZIP file includes simple program run measure performance control program
It program used contest compare result contest winner
The ZIP file also contains detailed instruction document PDF format requires Adobe Acrobat
These instruction explain assembly language command use program NANORGs
The instruction also explain detail virtual world simulated contest program
The Experimental Procedure section contains brief instruction downloading ZIP file getting started
To project following term concept related processor programming familiar To experiment need following material equipment Holographic Poster Letters Vinyl Letters Numbers ArtSkills Trifold Header Poster Making Kit ArtSkills Trifold Header Poster Lights This section provides information virtual world NANORGs navigate well information detail running program
You click link skip section interest button browser return list You write assembly language program using Symantec NANORG assembly language control individual NANORG
To write program use standard text editor Notepad
You use accompanying executable file assemble test NANORG logic
When run compile NANORG source code NANORG machine language create NANORG clone copy logic
Each NANORGs function individual entity copy program memory register etc
This colony NANORG clone running program logic placed virtual tank must harvest energy
At start program clone randomly placed wide high tank sludge along clone malicious previous generation NANORG drone
Each NANORG including drone start unit energy
The tank location numbered position corner tank
In given tank hundred chunk sludge
Every time NANORG eats chunk sludge receives unit energy
Each chunk sludge member specific sludge type identified integer value

Your NANORGs sense type chunk eating chunk
Some type sludge entirely safe NANORG eat simply provide energy type sludge toxic still provide energy
For example might total chunk sludge different type tank type type type type type
All chunk sludge type chunk type chunk type chunk type might safe eat type might toxic NANORG cause mutation memory
The number different sludge type quantity type sludge varies tank tank
In one tank might different type sludge IDs tank may different type sludge IDs
If N different type sludge particular tank approximately N different type sludge toxic NANORGs
For example different type sludge IDs exactly different type sludge toxic
ID toxic IDs safe eat
All food given type guaranteed either toxic safe eat never case food type safe food type toxic
Which specific type sludge toxic given tank determined randomly varies tank tank
If organism eats chunk sludge toxic type cause one word bit organism memory mutate
Note malicious drone completely immune mutagenic effect sludge become mutated eating toxic type sludge
You determine ID number given chunk organism use instruction square chunk sludge
Your organism learn type sludge toxic avoid like
Each time one NANORGs one earlier malicious generation NANORGs eats chunk sludge new chunk type sludge type therefore toxicity dropped random location tank automatically creating perpetual source energy
To gain point NANORGs must eat sludge gain energy release energy designated collection point using instruction
Your final score equal total amount energy released tank end million tick
Each organism may exceed energy unit time limiting much organism eat burning energy executing instruction using instruction release energy instruction charge neighboring NANORG
To release energy gain point NANORG must first travel collection point tank use instruction
different collection point randomly distributed within tank
Your organism sense top collection point using instruction collection point displayed character
Be careful release much energy time NANORG may run energy need operate find food
Each NANORG including drone get execute single machine language instruction per tick simulation
Each instruction consumes either unit energy computation unit energy travel adjacent square tank
Attempting release energy collection point drain organism energy without increasing score careful
If NANORG run energy die instead hibernates
An active NANORG reawaken hibernating NANORG sharing energy using instruction
You programming NANORG using simple assembly language compiled NANORG machine language execution drone also written assembly language use machine language NANORGS
The executable Symantec provided project simple assembler well disassembler language
Your NANORG program word long never terminate continuously hunt food produce energy finally terminated end simulation
In addition traditional assembly language instruction like move data NANORG assembly language also includes instruction control NANORG
Your organism use instruction travel tank EAT instruction eat sludge instruction determine organism standing sludge top collection point type sludge different ID number collection point ID instruction release energy collection point
Furthermore organism special instruction interact adjacent organism
The instruction used memory adjacent organism including NANORGs drone
The instruction used NANORG transfer portion energy adjacent organism
The NANORG virtual machine used NANORGs drone exactly word memory numbered
The NANORG language instruction capable word time read write individual byte
Attempts access memory outside range return value cause NANORG program terminate
Since organism data logic stored within word memory program may use technique NANORG instruction
The CPU happily execute data instruction long properly encoded
The NANORG machine support UNSIGNED arithmetic processor support number
All instruction machine language exactly memory word long instruction must aligned boundary
CPU restrict instruction pointer multiple
The first memory word instruction specifies opcode addressing mode used operand
The second third word specify operand instruction
The designer NANORG hardware chose encoding opposed instruction encoding reduce impact logic mutation
In order simplify process writing NANORGs jump call instruction NANORG program use immediate operand use target offset enabling write relocatable code desired see Operand Details bullet file
The NANORG CPU register numbered used instruction
All register used interchangeably
Each NANORG also flag register referred instruction pointer program counter
Unlike typical processor arithmetic instruction set CPU flag
See file information instruction set flag
The CPU stack pointer called SP whose value start start execution
When pushing value onto stack stack pointer value stored specified location NANORG memory
When popping value stack top value stack fetched first stack pointer
If stack pointer invalid
large instruction reset instruction run
You directly refer stack pointer instruction using instead normal register like
If point NANORG CPU encounter invalid instruction attempt interpret run instruction possible
Here possible case Before run program first need properly set working directory folder saved file using command
When first open command prompt Windows see prompt like Username name Windows user logged computer
So saved file called NANORGs Documents folder would need type note type part symbol To assemble run organism source file see work use command line equivalent Linux OSX detailed section Where whatever name NANORG assembly file
This assemble source file report syntax error find
If source program bring simple user interface watch organism run simulation
You hit time terminate simulation
Note line bottom screen This indicates current score much energy NANORGs generated far million tick elapsed
The seed number specifies random number seed used run simulation
If run contest program seed value S NANORG assembly file result every time simplifying debugging process
There two different type organism shown screen NANORGs malicious drone NANORGs
Your organism represented upper letter
The drone represented using sign
Food represented asterisk
Collection point represented dollar sign
The entrant hibernating NANORGs energy represented period
hibernating drone NANORGs represented comma
When simulation completes million organism including drone perish summary simulation printed If want compare score best brightest top three score contest entrant Symantec The contest program provided Windows Red Hat Linux Apple OS X used test debug NANORG program
Here get started
If access old Mac computer recommend using Windows machine project
The file downloadable Materials Equipment section contains Windows Linux Apple version contest program
The contest program file Red Hat Linux called
The contest program file Apple OSX called
First extract file directory choice Apple Linux computer
Next open command shell
csh switch directory hold contest file
In order run contest executable Linux Apple OS X need change permission program file first
After extracting file official contest file directory hard drive run command shown within command shell directory contest file For Apple type following command line hit enter
For Linux type following command line hit enter
You runnable executable file either Apple OS X Red Hat Linux
To run executable Apple OS X command shell switch directory unzipped contest file type hit enter
To run executable Linux command shell switch directory unzipped contest file type hit enter
The remaining section describe use Windows version contest program
If running contest program Linux machine simply substitute documentation
If running contest program Apple machine simply substitute documentation
Note dot followed slash preceding filename
Occasionally debugging notice one NANORGs behaving erratically
You may wish run simulation debugging mode determine went wrong
To want run simulation using seed used last run ensures exact set circumstance reproduced
To write seed value first run
During second run invoke contest program follows Where specify letter misbehaving clone wish debug specify proper seed value example
This ensure assuming make change organism source code debugging session exactly recreate previous simulation debug mode
If want compare result NANORG program contest winner may searching online information longer directly available Symantec website
Try Google search something like symantec programming competition seed see find
To speed thing drastically UI quite slow may wish run simulation quiet mode
This ensure simulation run without output result simulation simply displayed upon completion
Note use debugger option game quiet mode Try one science activity quick anytime science exploration

Can nano syntax highlighting like gedit vim
How I enable
I need least bash python syntax highlight
The nano editor provides syntax highlighting language script
Check Link user nano configuration file present something similiar line Now syntax highlighting enabled nano whatever file linked You could also link multiple file Note Sometimes might get edited file
If error occurs unsetting environment variable help
You unset terminal
Solution obtained There also solution satisfied bash highlighting
One example found You also write file enable language highlighted nano version support
Yes however default syntax definition quite poor incomplete
I maintaining accurate set definition anyone find useful
To install run Add line Specify one want colorizing tune color preference
The describes feature yet unclassified file
These tool need get started end polished product
I used command quickly enable available language
As mentioned answer contains definition different language
Also mentioned enable highlighting language add path language definition want enable file
So example enable would add line
The command search file directory within specified directory
This include syntax highlighting plugins included default add Or edit see uncomment includes
This work version nano refuse accept wildcards file
Just run line every time add additional colour config
There live example screenshots html php The complete date syntax hilighters nano maintained
To install highlighter user run You use include add file Happy coding
I found syntax highlighting j
I appended user file However get file I could append I first copy local folder first
I made script add colour nano But course got color code work
If error manually edit file remove line give error
For trouble following instruction also check
These disable
I ran adding file realising already identical section

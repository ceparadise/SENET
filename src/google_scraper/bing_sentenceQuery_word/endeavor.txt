Glasgow Interactive Systems Group GIST Department Computer Science Glasgow University Glasgow
Tel Fax EMail This paper argues expanding scope science make difficult sustain traditional scientific engineering model research
In particular recent work formal method abandoned traditional empirical method
Similarly research requirement engineering human computer interaction challenged proponent formal method
These tension stem fact Science misnoma
Topics currently considered part discipline computing science technology rather theory driven
This creates problem academic department impose scientific criterion assessment PhDs
It therefore important people ask Research Computing Science starting higher degree
This paper intended high level introduction first year research student student advanced MSc course
It read conjunction research skill computing science
Good research practice suggests begin defining term
The Oxford Concise dictionary defines research However many reason approach unsatisfactory model research
The main objection carry high risk
For example artefact may fail long learn anything conclusion seeking support
Indeed often case approach ignores formation clear hypothesis conclusion artefact built
This may lead artefact become important researcher idea intended establish
The lack clear hypothesis need barrier might seem
The proof demonstration approach much common current engineering practice
Iterative refinement used move implementation gradually towards desired solution
The evidence elicited previous failed attempt used better define goal research work progress
The key problem iterative development artefact turn requires method structure
Engineers need carefully plan way fault found one iteration fed back subsequent development
This typically done testing technique based upon model scientific argument
This close relationship engineering scientific method surprising There many problem standard approach scientific empiricism applied computing science
The principle objection many aspect computing defy use probabilistic measure analysing result empirical test
For example many statistical measure rely upon independence test hypothesis
Such technique clearly used attempting measure performance system attempt optimise performance time rule load balancing algorithm etc
Secondly difficult impose standard experimental condition upon product computer science
For example program behaves one way one set operating condition guarantee behave way another set condition
These condition might go level alpha particle hitting memory chip
Thirdly difficult generalise result tightly controlled empirical experiment
For example user find system easy use evaluation guarantee another user able use product amidst distraction everyday working environment
Finally difficult determine sufficient number trial conducted support many hypothesis
For example attempt prove program always satisfies property almost certainly doomed failure using standard experimental technique The number potential execution path even simple code make impossible test property every possible execution path
The field mathematical reasoning research area right
It however possible identify two different approach use formal proof research technique computing science The first incredible care need made interpretation result mathematical proof
Formal method nothing system argumentation mistake expected
Problems arise mistake difficult detect given complex nature mathematics often used
Recall central feature empirical approach open peer review used check method correct
The second problem formal reasoning scope limited
Interactive time critical system pose specially challenge application mathematics
These issue addressed many problem remain
The third problem relates cost applying formal technique
It take long time acquire necessary skill
Similarly take several month conduct relatively simple proof medium large scale application
Finally argued inadequate discussion failure formal method
Again important recall failure prove hypothesis valuable result empirical technique
Exaggerated claim made formal reasoning typically researcher many claim falsified
As result error application mathematical reasoning seen source shame rather learning opportunity one colleague peer

Here three good reason every college student take introductory computer science course
First computing become inextricable part life
Understanding computer software work ca impact society therefore important part modern liberal art education
Second computing creative endeavor crossroad engineering mathematics psychology art
A computer science course integrate problem solving logic human factor artistic creativity
It hard imagine domain bridge hope teach college
Third computing valuable skill
While people take single computing course even course wo end Google Microsoft take lot computing background develop useful highly skill set
In introductory course student write smart phone apps educational game powerful web application DNA analysis tool
A single computer science course provide student skill use later course project senior thesis even internship job
But student
Colleges university need reimagine computing course meaningful compelling undergraduate already predisposed computer science first computer science course may also last computer science course
In many case existing computing course teach student use spreadsheet presentation software maybe write webpage
Those useful skill lack intellectual depth creativity real introductory computer science course
Other introductory course discus history computing impact society computing concept provide student actual programming experience
I believe first course computing certainly teach big idea discus fascinating history field end explore application implication computing society also give student rich meaningful experience writing program
And program student write submit forget program student genuinely excited spend least much time using showing friend family writing code
I encouraged increasing number innovative introductory course provide student rich experience
And I excited see student voting course foot
At institution developed required Harvey Mudd student immensely popular among four sister institution
At college student teaching introductory computer science student regardless ultimate major
And attracting hundred student sister college Claremont
They literature economics sociology major among many others
And Harvey Mudd monopoly innovative introductory course
A number institution including others pioneered successful course similar spirit
Compelling first course large impact attracting traditionally underrepresented group computing
The recent major computer science department North America reported percent bachelor degree CS go woman
Until Harvey Mudd number anything lower national average
In implemented new introductory course saw immediate increase number woman choosing major computer science
Over percent major woman held steady several year
While number small discern impact traditionally underrepresented group see evidence course drawing student major well
Finally university college include appropriately designed computer science course part general education curriculum
At many school undergraduate distribution requirement mathematics science computer science course included option
While I ca argue computer science important calculus statistic physical natural science course becoming extremely difficult argue equal player array extraordinary human achievement

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

LOS ANGELES Space shuttle Endeavour come final stop finally
The iconic black white orbiter flew time space past two decade CSC Sunday afternoon begin new mission museum exhibit
Endeavour scheduled pull CSC Saturday night natural utility obstacle well need maintenance transporter slowed pace shuttle parade delayed arrival day
Not many spectator came see shuttle roll seemed mind
I walked route I tell million people positive encouraging said science center president Jeffrey Rudolph
All heard
Thank
young people saying want astronaut
What phenomenal three day added
I may need sleep great three day
Arriving Exposition Park PDT EDT GMT Endeavour crossed finish line extended kilometer Los Angeles International Airport LAX cutting across grass path enter CSC Samuel Oschin Space Shuttle Display Pavilion
Endeavour reached threshold hangar PDT EDT GMT set enter building temporarily removed rear wall
Inside display pavilion Endeavour remain atop modified NASA overland transporter served shuttle chariot traverse Los Angeles Inglewood street
Nothing like ever attempted nothing like ever attempted mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said press conference Sunday
This event event I heartened heartened reception Angelenos given
Getting LAX science center small feat
But made Endeavour final mission success mayor added
Mission mission accomplished
The science center plan open Endeavour display public beginning
Endeavour transition science center got underway last year NASA awarded orbiter institution subsequently signed ownership
Shuttle technician previously readied Endeavour launch instead worked transform shuttle vehicle display
They removed hazardous material also saved orbiter propulsion system hardware possibly reused future launch vehicle
Last month flying piggyback NASA Kennedy Space Center Florida Los Angeles atop modified Boeing jumbo jet
The orbiter loaded onto transporter underwent final display preparation temporarily sheltered United Airlines hangar LAX
Early Friday morning airport began slow journey CSC
The road trip proceeded mostly schedule Saturday narrow clearance around street corner sign building tree Crenshaw Boulevard resulted series slow precision move
Dropping well mph kph top speed Endeavour four vehicle vast majority trip trek also extended needing reconfigure vehicle straddle median wider road along shuttle route
The four vehicle used vast majority journey
The exception brief spell Friday evening shuttle rebalance weight crossing freeway
In addition crowd gathered see arrival Exposition Park Endeavour welcomed two public celebration Saturday formal sport arena Inglewood dance tribute intersection Crenshaw Martin Luther King boulevard choreographed Debbie Allen
Due delay performance proceeded well Endeavour entered intersection
Although Endeavour never fly space return launch pad sort
The California Science Center plan build Samuel Oschin Air Space Center replace display pavilion Endeavour permanent home
In new facility Endeavour hoisted vertical exhibited pair solid rocket booster replica external fuel tank space shuttle looked liftoff
The temporary hangar future center named late entrepreneur philanthropist Samuel Oschin whose family foundation donated transformational gift toward million science center say need complete Endeavour exhibit
Toyota existing partnership science center pledged donate Tundra Endeavour Project website
The CSC also inviting member supporter become part Team Endeavour sponsoring one several thousand heat shield tile line shuttle underbelly
Those donate receive patch packed aboard Endeavour ferry flight California among benefit

answer question unorthodox way suggest begin CS journey exploring functional programming
Since Haskell fiend I might recommend though evergreen might wait
Most traditional curriculum start object oriented programming
But I think much easier go functional programming OO reverse
If want focus popular language learn functional programming Javascript
You start priming concept functional programming article like
Then pick tutorial site like good amount free content
In addition though I highly recommend learn material data structure algorithm point early career
In addition material answer I would recommend excellent source free knowledge
I think Stanford Princeton pair good algorithm course

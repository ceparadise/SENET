In specialized form purpose copying data different device
In contemporary system usually used mediating computer application slow
Spooling allows program hand work done peripheral proceed task begin input transcribed
A dedicated program maintains orderly sequence job peripheral feed data rate
Conversely slow peripheral spooler maintain sequence computational job waiting data starting job relevant input available see
The refers sequence job storage area held
In many case spooler able drive device full rated speed minimal impact processing
Spooling combination
Nowadays common use spooling printing formatted printing stored queue speed computer retrieved printed speed printer
Multiple process write document spool without waiting perform task spooler process operates printer
For example large organization prepares payroll check computation take minute even second printing process might take hour
If payroll program printed check directly would unable proceed computation check printed
Similarly spooling added operating system unable anything else including interact user printing
Spooler print management software often includes variety related feature allowing priority assigned print job notifying user document printed distributing print job among several printer selecting appropriate paper document etc
A applies spooling technique allow many computer share printer group printer
Print spoolers often configured add also called front document
These separate document identify document
often also state printed
name
Banner page valuable office environment many people share small number printer
Depending configuration banner page might generated client computer centralized print server printer
On printer using fanfold leading banner page would often printed twice one copy would always job separated
The page might include line printed fold would visible along edge stack printed output allowing operator easily separate job
Some system would also print banner page end job assuring user collected printout
Spooling also used mediate access reader punch drive slow sequential device
It allows application run speed CPU operating peripheral device full rate speed
A system us spooling maintain queue task started soon system resource process
Some messaging system used spool refer inbound outbound message queue terminology still found documentation software even though message often delivered immediately nowadays
Peripherals device always much slower core processing unit
This especially severe problem early
For example job read punched card generated printed output directly forced run speed slow mechanical device
The first spooling program IBM SPOOL System copied data punched card magnetic tape tape back punched card printer
even faster support started replace use magnetic tape middle eliminated use tape
Because unit record equipment IBM mainframe early slow common use small offline machine instead spooling
The term spool probably originates Simultaneous Peripheral Operations SPOOL software
Its derivation uncertain
may
Another explanation refers spool magnetic tape

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
To spool stand simultaneous peripheral operation online computer document task list job read store usually larger storage medium printed otherwise processed convenient time example printer finished printing current document
One envision spooling reeling document task list onto spool thread unreeled convenient time
The idea spooling originated early computer day input read punched card immediate printing processing immediately printing result
Since computer operates much faster rate device printer effective store line magnetic disk could conveniently printed printer free computer le busy working task
Actually printer frequently buffer large enough hold entire document requiring multiple operation printer
The spooling document printing job request still go mainframe computer many user share pool resource
On personal computer print job example Web page want print spooled output file hard disk printer already printing another file

Spooling process data temporarily held used executed device program system
Data sent stored memory volatile storage program computer request execution
Spool technically acronym simultaneous peripheral operation online
Spooling work like typical request queue spool data instruction process multiple source accumulated execution later
Generally spool maintained computer physical memory buffer interrupt
The spool processed ascending order working basis FIFO first first algorithm
The common implementation spooling found typical device keyboard mouse printer
For example printer spooling sent printer first stored memory printer spooler
Once printer ready fetch data spool print

Spooling process sending data temporary storage area computer
This data may contain
Like spool thread data build within spool multiple file job sent
However unlike spool thread first job sent spool first one processed
The common type spooling print spooling print job sent print spool transmitted printer
For example print document within document data spooled temporary storage area printer warms
As soon printer ready print document data sent spool printer document printed
Print spooling get name technology used print job stored large reel magnetic tape
The data reel physically spooled electrostatic printer printed output saved tape

Printer spool handled modern operating system
Hemera Images Your computer process data store sends different peripheral output device
Computer science us term specific type process spooling buffering caching
These term specific meaning computer science similar function
Many people especially use interchangeably
The specific depend case
When type keyboard using input device
When letter type appear screen screen output device
In many operating system text appearing terminal window called standard output
Standard output buffered default
The reason nobody really want type everything see second experience typing program rightly convinced something wrong
Spooling name come acronym Simultaneous Peripheral Operation SPOOL
Spooling wait entire operation done sending output device network likeliest encounter spooling probably come sending document printer
If ever wondered delay press Print document coming printer spooling computer process entire print job format printer handle sends serial bus printer
Spooling also used sending receiving email
Spooling great sort computer task appropriate others
Watching video YouTube come expectation clicking Play cause video begin playing immediately
For work website sends small part video page load start sending next part video Play button clicked
These subsequent part queued buffer video play smoothly even though fully downloaded start
There third process used related spooling buffering caching
When computer cache file store local copy accessed speed local hard drive
Internet browser cache file get accessed lot time watch video hit Replay button browser usually pulling copy file downloaded previously rather downloading
At level bit byte CPU video card cache data boost performance

Spooling Spool Spooling In computer science Spool acronym simultaneous peripheral operation
In late early computer used SPOOL software IBM SPOOL System copy file one medium another punch card tape tape punch card tape printer occasional use copying
Early mainframe computer disk drive slightly recent one current standard small expensive hard disk later system SPOOL use tape disappeared favor disk
The introduction relatively inexpensive IBM led temporary reduction use SPOOL software
The common spooling application print spooling document formatted printing stored usually area disk retrieved printed printer rate
Printers typically print single document time require second minute
With spooling multiple process write document print queue without waiting
As soon process written document spool device process perform task separate printing process operates printer
For example city prepares payroll check actual computation may take matter minute even second printing process might take hour
If program printed directly computing resource would tied program able finish
The true personal computer
Without spooling word processor would unable continue printing finished
Without spooling program would relegated pattern fast processing long wait inefficient paradigm

A cold standby redundancy method involves one system backup another identical primary system
The cold standby system called upon failure primary system
Cold standby system turned install configure system data turned needed
Thereafter employed updating noncritical data done infrequently failure primary system
In contrast hot standby system running simultaneously another identical primary system
On failure primary system hot standby system immediately take replace primary
In setup data mirrored real time system identical data
Also contrast warm standby system run background primary system data regularly mirrored secondary server
Therefore time primary secondary system contain different data different data version

Hot standby redundant method one system run simultaneously identical primary system
Upon failure primary system hot standby system immediately take replacing primary system
However data still mirrored real time
Thus system identical data
Hot standby also known hot spare especially component level hard drive disk array
Hot standby also described failover technique ensure system reliability security achieved standby device system ready take event device system failure
Hot standby also describes ability software hardware component connect server run query standby recovery mode
Additionally describes ability server continually answer query maintaining open connection user recovery normal operation
Examples hot standby component include switch network printer computer hard drive often considered redundant
Hot standby frequently refers immediate backup critical component without entire system would fail
The switchover occurs manually automatically normally mean error detection involved
Furthermore hot standby component designed significantly reduce time required failed system return normal operation ensuring provide percent system availability
A hot standby system may located close primary system building city another state even another country
The location hot standby particularly relevant example primary system located earthquake fault line

Article Cost Analysis Cold Standby System Considering Hardware Software Failures Inspection Maximum Repair Time
November
Published Foundation Computer Science FCS NY USA
The present paper deal reliability model two unit cold standby system exposed two type failure
In unit hardware software componentes work together fail independently
single server visit system immediately required
The server inspects unit case software failure decides either repair replace
The component undergo repair failure replaced new one case arriving maximum repair time
All time distribution considered exponential
Various measure reliability system obtained using regenerative point technique
Finally simulation study done illustrate result
Cold Standby System Maximum Repair Time Inspection Replacement Profit Gain

Warm standby method secondary backup system run background primary system
Data mirrored secondary regular interval mean time server contain exact data

We present reliability analysis multiple cold standby system satisfying usual condition
random variable single repair facility perfect repair queueing
Each unit constant failure rate arbitrary repair time distribution
We introduce basic set measure related stochastic process defined filtered probability space
The set measure constitutes system renewal integral equation
The solution constructed mean Cauchy integral
A particular case deterministic repair provides explicit result illustrated graph

This service advanced JavaScript available learn Current intrusion detection mechanism quite low detection high false alarm rate
Thus propose model intrusion tolerant system ITS increase survivability level successful attack
In paper present cluster recovery model using cold standby cluster software rejuvenation methodology applicable security field also le expensive
Firstly perform steady state analysis cluster system consider ITS cold standby cluster
The basic idea investigate consequence exact response face attack rejuvenate running service reconfigure
It show system operates intrusion provides continued critical function gracefully degrades system functionality face intrusion

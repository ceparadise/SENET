A reporter recently asked advice I kid coming high school
I said Go computer science probably always job
I wonder I said Skip college spend time teaching computer
Especially America education incurs tremendous debt educational institution teach little really matter ask Ca I
I computer science degree though I worked company founded firm
I literally grown field
I started programming BASIC I year old learned create software dBase I
I even grabbed big book compiler theory kind nonsense I know everything I needed
If I picked degree I would missed entire boom graduated ensuing recession experience carrying load debt
Instead I stayed gainfully employed month two bust joined successful startup economy picked
But teaching code sound advice given today grinding economy
If believe headhunter national unemployment rate technology sector percent
If recall percent unemployment supposedly full employment everyone want job one
Moreover u industry believe supply talented programmer forever constrained
A recruiter recently asked employer picky
I explained people earned computer science degree know theory ca code
Instead succeed putting thing resume match keywords
Plus company consider responsibility provide training mentoring
In fairness scarcity talent created mercenary culture Now employer paid learn new skill let check see ad Dice Craigslist higher rate pay

SEI Insights Strategic Management Architectural Technical Debt The Latest Research Software Engineering Cybersecurity Posted While agile method become popular commercial software development organization engineering discipline needed apply agility system well defined practiced
To help bridge gap SEI recently hosted
The event brought together researcher practitioner around world discus best apply agile method environment found government many industry
This blog posting third installment series highlighting research presented forum summarizes presentation made forum senior researcher SEI discussed use agile architecture practice manage strategic intentional technical debt
In opening comment audience Ozkaya established two decade ago coined metaphor refers degraded quality resulting overly hasty delivery software capability user
Cunningham stated shipping code quickly like going debt
A little debt speed development beneficial long debt paid back promptly rewrite reduces complexity streamlines future enhancement
A delicate balance needed desire release new software capability rapidly satisfy user desire practice sound software engineering reduces subsequent rework
Increasingly software engineering community adopting agile technique interested understanding quantify technical debt manage debt strategy
Ozkaya observed organization often driven agile technique observing increasing technical debt system
Ironically adopting agile practice scale without considering implication also easily lead technical debt
Ozkaya talk emphasized need explicitly acknowledge tradeoff taking shortcut software development accelerate product delivery versus applying slower le risky software development method
Ozkaya questioned whether possible avoid technical debt altogether especially given increasing scale complexity system coupled trend DoD government agency sustain system expected operate decade
Another factor impacting technical debt workforce diversity turnover often yield distributed team must managed remotely
Given factor Ozkaya said inevitable technical debt accumulate since environment system technology change technical debt become ongoing software engineering practice must understood managed effectively
Technical debt financial implication like monetary debt payment
Developers choose pay interest technical debt form additional time effort required understand modify poor structured code
Conversely developer pay debt refactoring poorly designed code reduce future effort
Ozkaya suggested understanding financial model implied debt metaphor help establish structural aspect debt
These financial implication suggest following question agile development team must consider Much existing literature technical debt focus issue reducing time needed modify software function add new feature fix bug
Ozkaya said also important organization consider best describe technical debt perspective
The SEI focus
Specifically SEI researcher focusing identifying implication cost architectural change
Often particular symptom system described technical debt code bad also occurred throughout system development
To establish common understanding term technical debt Ozkaya referenced created
To date much work focused McConnell Type debt unintentional
This type technical debt often result poor design decision poor coding
Ozkaya specifically drew attention second type debt described McConnell intentional strategic optimized present future
This Type debt occur agile software development lifecycle trying accelerate development perspective requires optimizing goal shipping product known shortcoming gain protect market share
What crucial incurring Type debt process revisiting reworking shortcut ensure system longevity
Ozkaya also highlighted prescription managing technical debt
Highsmith focus understanding monitoring accumulating cost change result technical debt
As year iteration go new function added new technology upgraded cost change start increase dramatically
Lastly Ozkaya referenced technical debt focus emphasizing value perspective system development
Value could include feature immediate benefit stakeholder
Value also negative defect must resolved
Most time however value go unrecognized invisible aspect software often architectural feature enhance system done well incur technical debt done poorly
Ozkaya presented three strategy managing technical debt In system number year spent system launched often detrimental success since gap requirement performance detected late lifecycle expensive remedy
In instance using technical debt strategy dividing system delivery chunk might advantageous
Ozkaya told audience eliciting quantifying impact technical debt strategy yet repeatable engineering practice
Factors consider quantifying debt include tracking defect changing velocity actually got done agile iteration versus planned cost rework
These indicator could mapped cost development yield greater understanding value paying back technical debt versus paying back
Ozkaya work focus include code though Ozkaya interested quantifying debt early lifecyle code analysis alone may provide enough direction
Specifically Ozkaya research focus understanding right set architectural model used seamlessly within agile software development method provide feedback development team help understand impact rework
Ozkaya stressed rework might planned could resurface change requirement technology
Among organization interested managing technical debt increasing focus tool conducting structural analysis
Trends show increasing sophistication support structural analysis addition code analysis first step toward analyzing financial impact technical debt relating structural analysis cost effort rework
Several capability also exist including Ozkaya said main motivation structured technical debt analysis emerging analysis tool help organization develop strategy systematically paying debt
These strategy involve eliciting business indicator system could defined particular application domain determining indicator managed
Example indicator include For system adding technical debt backlog continuously monitoring debt common practice
Development team determine strategy addressing monitoring technical debt appropriate organization
For example strategy could involve amortizing percent conducting dedicated iteration focus paying back debt
Ozkaya also pointed highlight architectural tactic involved strategically managing technical debt
The principle agile software development software architecture improve visibility project status offer better tactic risk management
These principle help software team develop feature time frame budget
The article described three tactic aligning development system decomposition creating architectural runway using matrix team architecture
Harmonious use tactic critical especially DoD system must service several decade created multiple contractor team changing scope due evolving technology emerging need
In describing future area SEI research strategic management architectural technical debt Ozkaya pointed topic succinctly communicates key issue observed project including In conclusion Ozkaya recommended several immediate step organization take managing technical debt The series summarized discussion director SEI
Carleton provided overview forum discussed area SEI work focused applying agile method
Takai discussed agile method introduced DoD software acquisition development environment
The summarized discussion senior researcher SEI highlighted importance collaboration end user well among team facilitate adoption agile approach DoD acquisition program
Our next post series summarize discussion two SEI researcher including Agile Research Forum examined following aspect applying agile method development environment We look forward hearing thought applying agile comment section

The technical debt metaphor acknowledges development team sometimes accept compromise system one dimension example modularity meet urgent demand dimension example deadline compromise incur If properly managed interest debt may continue accrue severely hampering system stability quality impacting team ability deliver enhancement pace satisfies business need
Although unmanaged debt disastrous result strategically managed debt help business organization take advantage opportunity fulfill market need acquire stakeholder feedback
Because architecture leverage within overall development lifecycle strategic management architectural debt primary importance
During session discus technical debt metaphor learn technique measuring communicating technical debt
We compare strategy share practice help make choice
We conclude raising awareness effort move beyond metaphor provide software engineer foundation managing tradeoff based model economic impact

In current age software development phrase technical debt become part common vocabulary
Wikipedia defines technical debt neologistic metaphor referring eventual consequence poor evolving software architecture software development within codebase
Buried within eloquent statement clear dividing line
There two distinct type technical debt strategic
Technical debt commonly compared credit card debt interest unpaid debt become stifling
Proper tracking categorization debt help avoid technical bankruptcy
This happens team longer make forward progress due ongoing debt derailment
Framing technical debt making visible arguing maintenance paramount
Strategic debt intentional debt accumulated project
They conscious proactive decision larger short term benefit
This debt focus architectural business
Deciding forgo extensive architecture increased speed market reduce overhead intentional debt
Small company new unproven product utilize concept keep cost increase innovation
Other company utilize strategic debt maintain customer satisfaction meet project deadline
The two common reason strategic debt time money
debt unintentional debt accumulated project
This debt happen feature poorly designed coded
code creates maintenance QA process potentially customer issue deployed
Programming may also loose effectiveness due lack communication concept lost translation
Unfortunately debt unknown participant created
Programmers knowingly design write ineffective code
The decision tackle debt based three factor found size problem problem located
Once area identified debt decision forgo correcting situation become strategic
Although strategic debt product grow shrink time debt tendency increase team grows
This increase accounted proper oversight
This translate new procedural step coding standard code review retrospective much
Each company different
It important keep continuous eye strategic debt
Initial estimate size time line affected business decision unanticipated customer growth
Strategic debt becomes problem properly monitored

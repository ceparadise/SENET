In specialized form purpose copying data different device
In contemporary system usually used mediating computer application slow
Spooling allows program hand work done peripheral proceed task begin input transcribed
A dedicated program maintains orderly sequence job peripheral feed data rate
Conversely slow peripheral spooler maintain sequence computational job waiting data starting job relevant input available see
The refers sequence job storage area held
In many case spooler able drive device full rated speed minimal impact processing
Spooling combination
Nowadays common use spooling printing formatted printing stored queue speed computer retrieved printed speed printer
Multiple process write document spool without waiting perform task spooler process operates printer
For example large organization prepares payroll check computation take minute even second printing process might take hour
If payroll program printed check directly would unable proceed computation check printed
Similarly spooling added operating system unable anything else including interact user printing
Spooler print management software often includes variety related feature allowing priority assigned print job notifying user document printed distributing print job among several printer selecting appropriate paper document etc
A applies spooling technique allow many computer share printer group printer
Print spoolers often configured add also called front document
These separate document identify document
often also state printed
name
Banner page valuable office environment many people share small number printer
Depending configuration banner page might generated client computer centralized print server printer
On printer using fanfold leading banner page would often printed twice one copy would always job separated
The page might include line printed fold would visible along edge stack printed output allowing operator easily separate job
Some system would also print banner page end job assuring user collected printout
Spooling also used mediate access reader punch drive slow sequential device
It allows application run speed CPU operating peripheral device full rate speed
A system us spooling maintain queue task started soon system resource process
Some messaging system used spool refer inbound outbound message queue terminology still found documentation software even though message often delivered immediately nowadays
Peripherals device always much slower core processing unit
This especially severe problem early
For example job read punched card generated printed output directly forced run speed slow mechanical device
The first spooling program IBM SPOOL System copied data punched card magnetic tape tape back punched card printer
even faster support started replace use magnetic tape middle eliminated use tape
Because unit record equipment IBM mainframe early slow common use small offline machine instead spooling
The term spool probably originates Simultaneous Peripheral Operations SPOOL software
Its derivation uncertain
may
Another explanation refers spool magnetic tape

Acronym refers putting special area ready
Spooling useful device access different rate
The buffer provides waiting station data rest slower device catch
The common spooling In print spooling loaded buffer usually area disk pull buffer rate
Because document buffer accessed printer perform operation printing take place
Spooling also let place number print job instead waiting one finish specifying next one

I think kind service come kind printer service
In computing SPOOL acronym simultaneous peripheral operation
It type buffering
The common spooling application print spooling place task job queue extended later processing
Let Put simple term printer spooler process execute one one till last process
Example When printer receives one print command stored buffer request print page one
like print print print page one one till last page print
The Next part question software hardware
combination printer driver handle software part printer hardware handle hardware part store data requested command temporary printer hardware process call spooling Buffering
Please correct incorrect

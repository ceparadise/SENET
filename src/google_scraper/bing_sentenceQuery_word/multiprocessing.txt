What multiplexing mean abstract form
I understand hardware network
What would good definition
Since definition basically multiple thing time many thing
I would suggest simple applied computer science
Though specific instance multiplexer putting multiple signal data channel word computer science may also used replace multiplexer
For example could consider running many process multiplexing common term multiprocessing
However example many signal canonical example
There
Multiplexing process combine multiple signal transmit single sending multiple signal stream information carrier time form single complex signal recovering separate signal receiving Multiplexing computer networking refers technique whereby multiple user share bandwidth channel
You could use analogy postal service whereby different people use one postal office medium send letter loved one receiver
Two famous form multiplexing TDM FDM
TDM whereby channel regulates sender one sender send message one time using network full bandwidth
After time interval next sender send process repeat sender
Therefore analogy Sender A one hour send letter postal service personell use full resource deliver letter respective recipient
In FDM sender use network bandwidth whole time limited multiple user time therefore delivery could take little longer
Back analogy Sender A sends sends letter post office letter well sender therefore delivery take longer
Depending see either could faster
But like I said type multiplexing well confined two way I described
I hope make sense

In two central processing unit CPUs used single computing system
In system computingfacility ability support one processor allocate different computing task two processor
also refers execution several software process simultaneously within single computer
The term multitasking multiprogramming used appropriately describing idea found essentially software whereas hand term applicable use multiple hardware CPUs
A computermay multiprogramming facility may one two feature may lack
Computers nowadays mostly come least processing unit may even two processor
Implementing two processor processor run various computer program system much efficient way
In hardware structure multiprocessor computing unit two identical processor connected single shared main memory run single operating system
This structure mostly use nowadays
The architecture applied core manages processor separate one
The different processor usually interconnected bus crossbar switch mesh network
increase efficiency processor handling different complex task
help multiple processor execute single task thereby saving time power
A particular task assigned single processor additional processing unit may added resulting improvised performance increased support additional process
Specialized hardware configuration operating system made intended work unit
Operating system integrate multiple processor communication processor becomes impossible processor may remain idle
Symmetric Multiprocessing Units using crossbar switch bus interconnecting device may problem handling large number process
These problem low bandwidth power consumption among different processor hard drive disk partition may make computing operation slow
ASMP distribution processing load different symmetric processing AMP
Here separate processor handle specific group process task exclusive processor
The processor system run customer program
The processor used identical might quite different architecture interface functionality
The processor may processor single chip package may separate silicon chip
Since different processor run operating system customer program differ speed effectiveness resulting operating system lagging behind running computer program
Sometimes lagging behind operating system processor might result shutdown computer

use two CPUs within single
The term also refers ability system support one processor ability allocate task
There many variation basic theme definition multiprocessing vary context mostly function CPUs defined one multiple dy one multiple package one etc
According dictionary computer system two multiple processor sharing peripheral order simultaneously process program
A textbook defined multiprocessor system similarly noting processor may share system memory facility also gave synonymous term
At level sometimes used refer execution multiple concurrent system process running separate CPU core opposed single process one instant
When used definition multiprocessing sometimes contrasted may use single processor switch time slice task

Multiprocessing however mean true parallel execution multiple process using one processor
Multiprocessing necessarily mean single process task us one processor simultaneously term generally used denote scenario
Other author prefer refer operating system technique reserve term hardware aspect one processor
The remainder article discus multiprocessing hardware sense
In multiprocessor defined machine
As normally construed tightly coupled share memory multiprocessor entire class MIMD machine also contains multicomputer system
According article possibly first expression idea multiprocessing found word said translated machine brought play give several result time greatly abridge whole amount process
In system CPUs may equal may reserved special purpose
A combination hardware software design consideration determine symmetry lack thereof given system
For example hardware software consideration may require one particular CPU respond hardware interrupt whereas work system may distributed equally among CPUs execution code may restricted one particular CPU whereas code may executed combination processor
Multiprocessing system often easier design restriction imposed tend le efficient system CPUs utilized
Systems treat CPUs equally called SMP system
In system CPUs equal system resource may divided number way including ASMP NUMA multiprocessing multiprocessing
In multiprocessing processor used execute single sequence instruction multiple context SIMD often used multiple sequence instruction single context MISD used system sometimes applied describe multiple sequence instruction multiple context MIMD
Tightly coupled multiprocessor system contain multiple CPUs connected bus level
These CPUs may access central shared memory SMP may participate memory hierarchy local shared memory SM
The Regatta example high end SMP system
processor dominated multiprocessor market business PCs major option release range processor
Both range processor onboard cache provided access shared memory Xeon processor via common pipe Opteron processor via independent pathway system
Chip multiprocessor also known computing involves one processor placed single chip thought extreme form tightly coupled multiprocessing
Mainframe system multiple processor often tightly coupled
Loosely coupled multiprocessor system often referred based multiple standalone single dual processor interconnected via high speed communication system common
A Linux example system
Tightly coupled system perform better physically smaller loosely coupled system historically required greater initial investment may rapidly node loosely coupled system usually inexpensive commodity computer recycled independent machine upon retirement cluster
Power consumption also consideration
Tightly coupled system tend much energy efficient cluster
This considerable economy realized designing component work together beginning tightly coupled system whereas loosely coupled system use component necessarily intended specifically use system
Loosely coupled system ability run different operating system OS version different system

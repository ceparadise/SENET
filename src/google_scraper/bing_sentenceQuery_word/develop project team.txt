current state information provides effective mean presenting information user system
Usually model created conducting interview referred
The interview consists facilitator asking series question designed extract required information describes process
The interviewer called facilitator emphasize participant provide information
The facilitator knowledge process interest important structured methodology question asked process expert
The methodology important usually team facilitator collecting information across facility result information interviewer must fit together completed
The model developed defining either current state process case final product called snapshot model collection idea process contain resulting model
Generation process data model used determine existing process information system sound need minor modification enhancement required corrective action
The creation business model way view automate information process
Analysis used fundamentally reshape way business organization conduct operation
CASE field scientific application set software tool method development result maintainable software product
It also refers method development together automated tool used software development process
The term software engineering CASE refer used automated development computer code
The CASE function include analysis design programming
CASE tool automate method designing documenting producing structured computer code desired
Two key idea Software System Engineering CASE Typical CASE tool exist
An IDE also known provides comprehensive facility software development
An IDE normally consists IDEs designed maximize programmer productivity providing component similar
Typically IDE dedicated specific provide feature set closely match language
A used express defined consistent set rule
The rule used interpretation meaning component structure
A modeling language graphical textual
Graphical modeling language use named symbol represent concept line connect symbol represent relationship various graphical annotation represent constraint
Textual modeling language typically use standardised keywords accompanied parameter make expression
Examples graphical modelling language field software engineering Not modeling language executable using necessarily mean programmer longer needed
On contrary executable modeling language intended amplify productivity skilled programmer address difficult problem
A fundamental style generally dictated project management methodology waterfall agile
Paradigms differ concept abstraction used represent element program object function variable constraint step comprise computation assignation evaluation continuation data flow
Sometimes concept asserted paradigm utilized cooperatively system architecture design case programming paradigm scope limited internal structure particular program module
A support
For example program written purely purely contain element paradigm
Software designer programmer decide use paradigm element
In programmer think program collection interacting object program thought sequence stateless function evaluation
When programming computer system many processor allows programmer think application set concurrent process acting upon logically shared
Just different group advocate different different advocate different
Some language designed support one paradigm support programming support functional programming programming language support multiple paradigm
Many programming paradigm well known method enable
For instance pure functional programming forbids using forbids using statement
Partly reason new paradigm often regarded doctrinaire overly rigid accustomed earlier style
Avoiding certain method make easier prove theorem program correctness simply understand behavior

In providing generic functionality selectively changed additional code thus providing software
A software framework provides standard way build deploy application
A software framework universal reusable provides particular functionality part larger facilitate development product solution
Software framework may include support program compiler code library tool set bring together different enable development
Frameworks key distinguishing feature separate normal The designer software framework aim facilitate software development allowing designer programmer devote time meeting software requirement rather dealing standard detail providing working system thereby reducing overall development time
For example team using develop banking website focus writing code particular banking rather mechanic request handling
Frameworks often add size program phenomenon termed
Due driven application need competing complementary framework sometimes end product
Further due complexity APIs intended reduction overall development time may achieved due need spend additional time learning use framework criticism clearly valid special new framework first encountered development staff
If framework used subsequent job taskings time invested learning framework cost code familiar project staff many programmer keep copy useful boilerplate common need
However framework learned future project faster easier complete concept framework make solution set familiarity code production logically rise
There claim made size code eventually bundled output product relative efficiency conciseness
Using library solution necessarily pull extra unused extraneous asset unless software linker making tight small wholly controlled specified executable module
The issue continues industry experience shown effective framework turn evolve common code enterprise instead using generic framework developed third party general purpose
An example would user interface application package office suite grows common look feel attribute method disparate bundled application grow unified suite tighter smaller suite product share integral utility library user interface
This trend controversy brings important issue framework
Creating framework elegant versus one merely solves problem still art rather science
Software implies clarity conciseness little waste extra extraneous functionality much user defined
For framework generate code example elegance would imply creation code clean comprehensible reasonably knowledgeable programmer therefore readily modifiable versus one merely generates correct code
The elegance issue relatively software framework stood test time best framework able evolve gracefully underlying technology built advanced
Even evolved many package retain legacy capability bloating final software otherwise replaced method retained parallel newer method
Software framework typically contain considerable housekeeping utility code order help bootstrap user application generally focus specific problem domain According Pree software framework consist
define overall architecture software system say basic component relationship
These remain unchanged frozen instantiation application framework
represent part programmer using framework add code add functionality specific project
In environment framework consists
framework consists existing class
When developing concrete software system software framework developer utilize hot spot according specific need requirement system
Software framework rely Do call u call
This mean class example new subclass receive message predefined framework class
Developers usually handle implementing

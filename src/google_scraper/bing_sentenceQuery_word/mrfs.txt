I new graphical model especially Markov Random Fields
I question MAP assignment
Let say graph structure potential function
MAP assignment MRFs defined probable assignment variable given evidence case
My question called MAP MLE anything else
What connection
I know MAP MLE share lot common except one thing MAP us prior distribution parameter
But I figure connection probable assignment MRF MAP
MLE point estimate MLE resides mode likelihood density
That L X X MLE X MAP stand maximum
It point estimate MAP resides mode posterior distribution distribution parameter conditioned observed data
We perform MAP estimation incorporating prior distribution parameter
X X X X X MAP X This simple application Bayes Theorem
The reason use proportional care marginal likelihood constant
Since constant point estimate still corresponds true MAP
By definition MAP least locally estimate posterior distribution
The key Maximum Likelihood estimate point estimate maximizes probability observing data
The MAP estimate point estimate least locally probable posterior distribution parameter
In end deciding whether use MLE MAP estimate model
It really depends interested
To stress difference one last time look difference two definition distribution maximized
In ML estimation maximizing distribution observing data MAP estimation maximizing distribution parameter
Hence say MAP estimate estimate whereas ML estimate

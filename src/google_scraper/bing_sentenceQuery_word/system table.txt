In replaces runtime computation simpler array indexing operation
The saving term processing time significant since retrieving value memory often faster undergoing expensive computation operation
The table may precalculated stored program storage calculated part program initialization phase even stored hardware platform
Lookup table also used extensively validate input value matching list valid invalid item array programming language may include pointer function offset label process matching input
also make extensive use reconfigurable lookup table provide programmable hardware functionality
Before advent computer lookup table value used speed hand calculation complex function statistical density function
In ancient CE India created one first encoded number system
In wrote multiplication table gave product every number time row list number starting one thousand descending hundred one hundred descending ten ten one one fraction Modern school child often taught memorize avoid calculation commonly used number x x
Early history computer operation particularly slow even comparison processor speed time
It made sense reduce expensive read operation form manual creating either static lookup table embedded program dynamic prefetched array contain commonly occurring data item
Despite introduction systemwide caching automates process application level lookup table still improve performance data item rarely ever change
Lookup table one earliest functionality implemented computer initial version including function among original function
This followed subsequent spreadsheet complemented specialized function simplify lookup vertical horizontal table
This known element checked equality turn associated value used result search
This often slowest search method unless frequently occurring value occur early list
For array lookup usually determine whether match data value
An example involves element found determining half table match may found repeating either success failure
This possible list sorted give good performance even list lengthy
For lookup unsigned value used index table extract result
For small range amongst fastest lookup even exceeding binary search speed zero branch executing
One discrete problem expensive solve many computer counting number bit set binary number sometimes called
For example decimal number binary contains three bit set binary
A simple example code designed count bit might look like This apparently simple algorithm take potentially hundred cycle even modern architecture make many branch loop branching slow
This ameliorated using compiler optimization
There however simple much faster algorithmic solution using table lookup
Simply construct static table entry giving number one bit set possible byte value

Then use table find number one byte integer using lookup byte turn sum
This requires branch four indexed memory access considerably faster earlier code
The source improved easily avoiding shifting byte unsigned char array preferably coded single statement instead function
Note even simple algorithm slow original code might run faster cache modern processor large lookup table fit well cache cause slower access memory addition example requires computing address within table perform four lookup needed
In data analysis application lookup table LUT used transform input data desirable output format
For example grayscale picture planet Saturn transformed color image emphasize difference ring
A classic example reducing computation using lookup table obtain result calculation value
Calculating trigonometric function substantially slow computing application
The application finish much sooner first precalculates sine number value example whole number degree The table defined static variable compile time reducing repeated run time cost
When program requires sine value use lookup table retrieve closest sine value memory address may also take step interpolating sine desired value instead calculating mathematical formula
Lookup table thus used mathematics computer system
An error lookup table responsible Intel infamous
Functions single variable sine cosine may implemented simple array
Functions involving two variable require multidimensional array indexing technique
The latter case may thus employ array replace function calculate limited range x value
Functions one result may implemented lookup table array structure
As mentioned intermediate solution use table combination small amount computation often using
combined interpolation produce higher accuracy value fall two precomputed value
This technique requires slightly time performed greatly enhance accuracy application require higher accuracy
Depending value precomputed interpolation also used shrink lookup table size maintaining accuracy
In lookup table often called give output value range index value
One common LUT called used determine color intensity value particular image displayed
In windowing refers related concept determining display intensity measured radiation
While often effective employing lookup table may nevertheless result severe penalty computation LUT replaces relatively simple
Memory retrieval time complexity memory requirement increase application operation time system complexity relative would required straight formula computation
The possibility may also become problem
Table access large table almost certainly cause
This phenomenon increasingly becoming issue processor outpace memory
A similar issue appears
In environment table lookup even expensive due mandatory involving additional comparison branch lookup
There two fundamental limitation possible construct lookup table required operation
One amount memory available one construct lookup table larger space available table although possible construct lookup table expense lookup time
The time required compute table value first instance although usually need done take prohibitively long time may make use lookup table inappropriate solution
As previously stated however table statically defined many case
Most computer perform basic arithmetic operation directly calculate given value
Instead use algorithm complex formula following compute value sine high degree precision However expensive compute especially slow processor many application particularly traditional need compute many thousand sine value every second
A common solution initially compute sine many evenly distributed value find sine choose sine value closest
This close correct value sine bounded rate change
For example Unfortunately table requires quite bit space IEEE number used byte would required
We use fewer sample precision significantly worsen
One good solution draw line two point table either side value locates answer line
This still quick compute much accurate sine function
Here example using linear interpolation Another solution us quarter space take bit longer compute would take account relationship sine cosine along symmetry rule
In case lookup table calculated using sine function first quadrant
sin
When need value assign variable angle wrapped first quadrant
We wrap angle four quadrant needed value always return correct value
first quadrant straight return second quadrant read third fourth negative first second respectively
For cosine return angle shifted

For tangent divide sine cosine handling may needed depending implementation When using interpolation size lookup table reduced using mean function close straight use sample point change value quickly use sample point keep approximation close real curve
For information see
Storage cache including disk cache file processor cache either code data work also like lookup table
The table built fast memory instead stored slower external memory maintains two piece data subrange bit composing external memory disk address notably lowest bit possible external address A single fast lookup performed read tag lookup table index specified lowest bit desired external storage address determine memory address hit cache
When hit found access external memory needed except write operation cached value may need updated asynchronously slower memory time position cache must replaced cache another address
In lookup table implemented whose select line driven address signal whose input value element contained array
These value either purpose specific function provided allow configurable value
An LUT encode storing function LUT
This efficient way encoding function LUTs bit input fact key component modern FPGAs provide reconfigurable hardware logic capability

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

These example intended limit option individual committee member
Along question question take available time expect encouraging word strong point portfolio constructive advice proceed

Given expansive growth field become challenging discern belongs modern computer science degree
My faculty engaging debate I coalesced thought answer question What every computer science major know
I tried answer question conjunction four concern My thought factor general principle specific recommendation relevant modern computing landscape
Computer science major feel free use guide
Please email suggestion addition deletion
Thanks suggestion reminder
I incorporate I receive keep living document
Having emerged engineering mathematics computer science program take approach hiring graduate
A say nothing programmer ability
Every computer science major build
A portfolio could simple personal blog post project accomplishment
A better portfolio would include page publicly browsable code hosted perhaps github Google code
Contributions open source linked documented
A code portfolio allows employer directly judge ability
GPAs resume
Professors design course project impress portfolio student conclusion course take time update
Lone wolf computer science endangered specie
Modern computer scientist must practice persuasively clearly communicating idea
In smaller company whether programmer communicate idea management may make difference company success failure
Unfortunately something fixed addition single class although solid course technical communication hurt
More class need provide student opportunity present work defend idea oral presentation
I would recommend student master presentation tool like PowerPoint favorite Keynote
Sorry much I love presentation tool static
For producing beautiful mathematical documentation LaTeX equal
All written assignment technical course submitted LaTeX
Computer science quite engineering
But close enough
Computer scientist find working engineer
Computer scientist traditional engineer need speak language language rooted real analysis linear algebra probability physic
Computer scientist ought take physic electromagnetism
But need take multivariate calculus differential equation good measure
In constructing sound simulation command probability often time linear algebra invaluable
In interpreting result substitute solid understanding statistic
Computer scientist comfortable practiced Unix philosophy computing
The Unix philosophy opposed Unix one emphasizes linguistic abstraction composition order effect computation
In practice mean becoming comfortable notion computing configuration software development
Given prevalence Unix system computer scientist today fluent basic Unix including ability Students reject Unix philosophy unless understand power
Thus best challenge student complete useful task Unix comparative advantage Some computer scientist sneer system administration IT task
The thinking computer scientist teach anything technician
This true
In theory
Yet attitude misguided computer scientist must able competently securely administer system network
Many task software development efficiently executed without passing system administrator
Every modern computer scientist able Programming language rise fall solar cycle
A programmer career
While important teach language relevant employer equally important student learn teach new language
The best way learn learn progamming language learn multiple programming language programming paradigm
The difficulty learning th language half difficulty th
Yet understand programming language one must implement one
Ideally every computer science major would take compiler class
At minimum every computer science major implement interpreter
The following language provide reasonable mixture paradigm practical application Racket dialect Lisp aggressively simple syntax
For small fraction student syntax impediment
To blunt student fundamental mental barrier accepting alien syntactic regime even temporarily lack mental dexterity survive career computer science
Racket powerful macro system facility programming thoroughly erase line data code
If taught correctly Lisp liberates
C terse unforgiving abstraction silicon
C remains without rival programming embedded system
Learning C imparts deep understanding dominant von Neumann architecture way language
Given intimate role poor C programming play prevalence buffer overflow security vulnerability critical programmer learn program C properly
JavaScript good representative semantic model popular dynamic language Python Ruby Perl
As native language web pragmatic advantage unique
Squeak modern dialect Smalltalk purest language
It imparts essence
Java remain popular long ignore
Standard ML clean embodiment system
The type system one greatest yet achievement modern computing
Though exponential complexity type inference always fast program human interest
The type system rich enough allow expression complex structural invariant
It rich fact program often
Though niche application logic programming alternate paradigm computational thinking
It worth understanding logic programming instance programmer may need emulate within another paradigm
Another logic language worth learning
miniKanren stress pure cut allowed logic programming
This constraint evolved alternate style logic programming called relational programming grant property typically enjoyed Prolog program
Scala fusion functional programming language
Scala Java
Built atop Java Virtual Machine compatible existing Java codebases stand likely successor Java
Haskell crown jewel family language
Fully exploiting laziness Haskell come closest programming pure mathematics major programming language
necessary evil
But since must taught must taught full
In particular computer science major leave grasp even
Any assembly language
Since popular might well
Learning compiler best way learn assembly since give computer scientist intuitive sense code transformed
Computer scientist understand generative programming macro lexical dynamic scope closure continuation function dynamic dispatch subtyping module functors monad semantic concept distinct specific syntax
Computer scientist must solid grasp formal logic proof
Proof algebraic manipulation natural deduction engages reasoning common routine programming task
Proof induction engages reasoning used construction recursive function
Computer scientist must fluent formal mathematical notation reasoning rigorously basic discrete structure set tuples sequence function power set
For computer scientist important cover reasoning Students learn enough number theory study implement common cryptographic protocol
Students certainly see common rare yet unreasonably effective data structure algorithm
But important knowing specific algorithm data structure usually easy enough look computer scientist must understand design algorithm greedy dynamic strategy span gap algorithm ideal implementation
At minimum computer scientist seeking stable employment know following Computer scientist ready implement extend algorithm operates data structure including ability search element add element remove element
For completeness computer scientist know imperative functional version algorithm
A grasp theory prerequisite research graduate school
Theory invaluable provides hard boundary problem provides mean circumventing initially appear hard boundary
Computational complexity legitimately claim one truly predictive theory computer science
A computer scientist know boundary tractability computability lie
To ignore limit invite frustration best case failure worst
At undergraduate level theory cover least model computation computational complexity
Models computation cover automaton regular language regular expression pushdown automaton language formal grammar Turing machine lambda calculus undecidability
At undergraduate level student learn least enough complexity understand difference P NP
To avoid leaving wrong impression student solve large problem NP reduction SAT use modern SAT solver
There substitute solid understanding computer architecture
Computer scientist understand computer transistor
The understanding architecture encompass standard level abstraction transistor gate adder muxes flip flop ALUs control unit cache RAM
An understanding GPU model computing important foreseeable future
A good understanding cache bus hardware memory management essential achieving good performance modern system
To get good grasp machine architecture student design simulate small CPU
Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes operating system
As computer scientist aware kernel handle system call paging scheduling filesystems internal resource management
A good understanding operating system secondary understanding compiler architecture achieving performance
Understanding operating system I would interpret liberally include runtime system becomes especially important programming embedded system without one
It important student get hand dirty real operating system
With Linux virtualization easier ever
To get better understanding kernel student could Given ubiquity network computer scientist firm understanding network stack routing protocol within network
The mechanic building efficient reliable transmission protocol like TCP top unreliable transmission protocol like IP magic computer scientist
It core knowledge
Computer scientist must understand involved protocol design example choose TCP choose UDP
Programmers need understand larger social implication congestion use UDP large scale well
Given frequency modern programmer encounter network programming helpful know protocol existing standard Computer scientist understand exponential back packet collision resolution mechanism involved congestion control
Every computer scientist implement following No student ever pas intro neworking class without sniffing instructor Google query
It probably going far require student implement reliable transmission protocol scratch atop IP I say personally transformative experience student
The sad truth security majority security vulnerability come sloppy programming
The sadder truth many school poor job training programmer secure code
Computer scientist must aware mean program compromised
They need develop sense defensive programming mind thinking code might attacked
Security kind training best distributed throughout entire curriculum discipline warn student native vulnerability
At minimum every computer scientist need understand A reader pointed computer scientist also need aware basic IT security measure choose legitimately good password properly configure firewall iptables
Cryptography make much digital life possible
Computer scientist understand able implement following concept well common pitfall Since common fault implementation cryptosystems every computer scientist know acquire random number task hand
At least nearly every data breach shown computer scientist need know salt hash password storage
Every computer scientist pleasure breaking ciphertext using cryptosystems statistical tool
RSA everyone
Every student create digital certificate set http apache
It surprisingly arduous
Student also write console web client connects SSL
As strictly practical matter computer scientist know use GPG use authentication ssh encrypt directory hard disk
Software testing must distributed throughout entire curriculum
A course software engineering cover basic style testing substitute practicing art
Students graded test case turn
I use test case turned student student
Students seem care much developing defensive test case unleash hell come sandbagging classmate
Programmers often write software programmer worse
User interface design broadly user experience design might underappreciated aspect computer science
There misconception even among professor user experience soft skill ca taught
In reality modern user experience design anchored principle human factor engineering industrial design
If nothing else computer scientist know interface need make ease executing task proportional frequency task multiplied importance
As practicality every programmer comfortable designing usable web interface HTML CSS JavaScript
Good visualization rendering data fashion human perceive information
This easy thing
The modern world sea data exploiting local maximum human perception key making sense
Parallelism back uglier ever
The unfortunate truth harnessing parallelism requires deep knowledge architecture multicore cache bus GPUs etc
And practice
Lots practice
It clear final answer parallel programming solution emerged
For student learn CUDA OpenCL
Threads flimsy abstraction parallelism particularly cache cache coherency involved
But thread popular tricky worth learning
Pthreads reasonably portable thread library learn
For anyone interested parallelism MPI prerequisite
On principle side seem enduring
The principle software engineering change fast programming language
A good course practice team software construction provides working knowledge pitfall inherent endeavor
It recommended several reader student break team three role leader rotating three different project
Learning attack maneuver large existing codebase skill programmer master one best learned school instead job
All student need understand centralized version control system like svn distributed version control system like git
A working knowlege debugging tool like gdb valgrind go long way finally become necessary
As demand secure reliable software increase formal method may one day end mean delivering
At present formal modeling verification software remains challenging progress field steady get easier every year
There may even come day within lifetime computer science major formal software construction expected skill
Every computer scientist least moderately comfortable using one theorem prover
I think matter one
Learning use theorem prover immediately impact coding style
For example one feel instinctively allergic writing statement cover possibility
And writing recursive function user theorem provers strong urge eliminate
There discipline dominated clever graphic
The field driven toward even defined good enough
As better way teach clever programming solid appreciation optimizing effort graphic simulation
Over half coding hack I learned came study graphic
Simple ray tracer constructed line code
It good mental hygiene work transformation necessary perform perspective projection wireframe engine
Data structure like BSP tree algorithm like rendering great example clever design
In graphic simulation many
Robotics may one engaging way teach introductory programming
Moreover cost robotics continues fall threshold passed enable personal robotics revolution
For program unimaginable degree personal physical automation horizon
If reason outsized impact early history computing computer scientist study artificial intelligence
While original dream intelligent machine seems far artificial intelligence spurred number practical field machine learning data mining natural language processing
Aside outstanding technical merit sheer number job opening relevance engineer indicates every computer scientist grasp fundamental machine learning
Machine learning doubly emphasizes need understanding probability statistic
At undergraduate level core concept include Bayesian network clustering learning
Databases common useful ignore
It useful understand fundamental data structure algorithm power database engine since programmer often enough reimplement database system within larger software system
Relational algebra relational calculus stand exceptional success story model computation
Unlike UML modeling ER modeling seems reasonable mechanism visualing encoding design constraint upon software artifact
A computer scientist set operate LAMP stack one good idea lot hard work away running company
My suggestion limited blind spot knowledge

Exploring trend development project management today By John Reiling There often misunderstanding hence mixed overlapping use term come programme management
Sometimes programme called project
Sometimes project called programme
In addition sometimes project portfolio programme mistakenly used interchangeably
This article intended clarify main difference distinguish unique aspect project portfolio programme project
A great way start think think term pyramid hierarchy
At top pyramid portfolio management contains project programme prioritised business objective
Below programme management contains numerous project interrelated since support particular business objective
Programmes consist multiple project project independent simply part portfolio
Projects differ programme strictly tactical nature
Here detailed look One key distinguishing feature Project Portfolio Management process clearly characterised business leadership alignment
Priorities set appropriate value optimisation process organisation
Risk reward considered balanced programme selected based alignment organisational strategy
Feedback provided programme project implementation portfolio adjustment occur necessary
Strategic change also require portfolio adjustment
A key distinguishing feature Programme Management business sponsorship
Almost definition based decision made Portfolio Management level programme sponsored business need
The programme take ownership benefit measured primarily based upon achievement benefit
Programmes also sometimes benefit stream set interrelated benefit increased R D capability combined increased market penetration cut across function organisation
Because programme naturally consisting multiple project span function within organisation element business system hence general management oriented
Project Management concerned delivery capability typically defined within programme
Projects need strategic initiative programme
Rather project take input develops implement tactical plan
Monitoring along way final measurement success typically based tactical consideration budget schedule upon achievement strategic business objective
Now basic distinction among Project Portfolio Management Programme Management Project Management defined organisation must personalise implementation three process
Some key factor affect choice made implementing follows Standards Project Portfolio Management Programme Management Project Management exist clear definition found within
The worldwide Project Management Institute PMI developed published following standard free member Writing business case crucial component business process

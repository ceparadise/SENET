Too much positive camber result premature wear outside tire cause excessive wear suspension part
Too much negative camber result premature wear inside tire cause excessive wear suspension part
Unequal camber cause vehicle pull lead side positive camber
The angle thrust line centerline
If thrust line right centerline angle said positive
If thrust line left center angle negative
It caused rear wheel axle misalignment cause steering pull lead one side
It primary cause crooked steering wheel
Correcting rear axle toe alignment necessary eliminate thrust angle
If possible using thrust angle reference line aligning front toe restore center steering

way data arranged accessed
It consists three separate related issue
When modern computer read writes memory address sized chunk typically bit bit modern system
mean putting data memory address equal multiple word size increase system performance due way handle memory
To align data word boundary may necessary insert unused byte end last data structure start next
For example computer word size bit data read aligned memory address multiple
When case
data start address instead computer read two byte chunk calculation requested data read may generate
Even though previous data structure end address next data structure start address
Two padding byte inserted two data structure address align next data structure address
When data smaller computer word size may possible place several data element single word
This known
For example four code packed single word saving bit compared unpacked data
Using packed structure requires computer process word original data
This may slow performance machine saving memory may worthwhile speed overall performance architecture
The widespread use packing character code era led machine word length multiple bit machine particularly common
The introduction ASCII led new design word length multiple bit bit code
Although data structure alignment fundamental issue modern computer many computer language computer language implementation handle data alignment automatically
certain implementation allow least partial control data structure padding may useful certain special circumstance
A memory address said multiple power
In context byte smallest unit memory access
memory address specifies different byte
An aligned address would minimum zero expressed
The alternate wording designates address ex
aligned byte aligned
A memory access said datum accessed byte long datum address aligned
When memory access aligned said
Note definition byte memory access always aligned
A memory pointer refers primitive data byte long said allowed contain address aligned otherwise said
A memory pointer refers data aggregate data structure array primitive datum aggregate aligned
Note definition assume primitive datum power two byte long
When case context influence condition datum considered aligned
Data structure stored memory stack static size known heap dynamic size known
A computer access memory single memory word time
As long memory word size least large largest supported computer aligned access always access single memory word
This may true misaligned data access
If highest lowest byte datum within memory word computer must split datum access multiple memory access
This requires lot complex circuitry generate memory access coordinate
To handle case memory word different memory page processor must either verify page present executing instruction able handle miss memory access instruction execution
When single memory word accessed operation atomic
whole memory word read written device must wait read write operation completes access
This may true unaligned access multiple memory word
first word might read one device word written another device second word read first device value read neither original value updated value
Although failure rare difficult identify
Most processor generate alignment fault load store instruction access misaligned address
This allows operating system emulate misaligned access using instruction
For example alignment fault handler might use byte load store always aligned emulate larger load store instruction
Some architecture like special unaligned load store instruction
One unaligned load instruction get byte memory word lowest byte address another get byte memory word highest byte address
Similarly instruction store appropriate byte higher lower memory word respectively
The architecture approach unaligned load store
The first step load upper lower memory word separate register
The second step extract modify memory word using special instruction similar MIPS instruction
An unaligned store completed storing modified memory word back memory
The reason complexity original Alpha architecture could read write value
This proved severe limitation often led code bloat poor performance
To address limitation extension called BWX added original architecture
It consisted instruction byte word load store
Because instruction larger slower normal memory load store instruction used necessary
Some C unaligned attribute applied pointer need unaligned instruction
While architecture originally require aligned memory access still work without instruction CPUs require data aligned substantial performance advantage using aligned data architecture
However also instruction unaligned access MOVDQU
Furthermore load store operation generally atomic properly aligned
The advantage supporting unaligned access easier write compiler need align memory expense cost slower access
One way increase performance RISC processor designed maximize raw performance require data loaded stored natural boundary data
So though memory commonly addressed loading integer would required start every bit machine loading integer floating point number would required start every bit machine
The processor could flag fault asked load number boundary would result slower call routine would need figure word word contained data extract equivalent value
Although normally allocates individual data item aligned boundary data structure often member different alignment requirement
To maintain proper alignment translator normally insert additional unnamed data member member properly aligned
In addition data structure whole may padded final unnamed member
This allows member array structure properly aligned
Padding inserted member followed member larger alignment requirement end structure
By changing ordering member structure possible change amount padding required maintain alignment
For example member sorted descending alignment requirement minimal amount padding required
The minimal amount padding required always le largest alignment structure
Computing maximum amount padding required complicated always le sum alignment requirement member minus twice sum alignment requirement least aligned half structure member
Although C allow compiler reorder structure member save space language might
It also possible tell C compiler pack member structure certain level alignment
pack mean align data member larger byte boundary padding member one byte long
One use packed structure conserve memory
For example structure containing single byte integer would require three additional byte padding
A large array structure would use le memory packed although accessing structure might take longer
This compromise may considered form
Although use packed structure frequently used conserve may also used format data structure transmission using standard protocol
However usage care must also taken ensure value struct member stored required protocol often may different endianness used natively host machine
The following formula provide number padding byte required align start data structure operator For example padding add offset aligned structure
The structure start multiple
However alignment already equal second modulo return zero therefore original value left unchanged
Since alignment power two modulo operation reduced bitwise boolean AND operation
The following formula produce aligned offset member stored sequentially memory structure member always precede always precede If type short stored two byte memory member data structure depicted would aligned
would offset offset offset
The size structure would byte
The type member structure usually default alignment meaning unless otherwise requested programmer aligned boundary
The following typical alignment valid compiler DMC compiling The notable difference alignment system compared system Some data type dependent implementation
Here structure member various type totaling compilation After compilation data structure supplemented padding byte ensure proper alignment member The compiled size structure byte
It important note last member padded number byte required total size structure multiple largest alignment structure member alignment int case
In case byte added last member pad structure size byte alignment int
In example total size structure size multiple alignment float
In example total size structure either size multiple alignment short
It possible change alignment structure reduce memory require conform existing format reordering structure member changing compiler alignment packing structure member
The compiled size structure match size
Note replaced thus eliminated longer necessary structure already aligned size long word
The alternative method enforcing structure aligned one byte boundary cause discard alignment structure member thus padding byte would inserted
While standard way defining alignment structure member compiler use directive specify packing inside source file
Here example This structure would compiled size system
The directive available compiler many others
Another example On Microsoft compiler particularly RISC processor unexpected relationship project default packing directive directive
The directive used packing size structure project default packing
This lead interoperability problem library header use example project packing smaller
For reason setting project packing value default byte would break directive used library header result binary incompatibility structure
This limitation present compiling
It would beneficial allocate memory aligned
If array partitioned one thread operate boundary unaligned cache line could lead performance degradation
Here example allocate memory double array size aligned cache byte
Alignment concern affect area much larger C structure purpose efficient mapping area hardware mechanism PCI remapping operation
For instance operating system KB page arbitrary KB chunk data
Instead usually region memory aligned KB boundary
This aligning page boundary let hardware map virtual address physical address substituting higher bit address rather complex arithmetic
Example Assume TLB mapping virtual address physical address
Note address aligned KB boundary
Accessing data located virtual address cause TLB resolution issue physical access
Here split luckily match hexadecimal representation split digit
The hardware implement translation simply combining first bit physical address last bit virtual address
This also referred virtually indexed abc physically tagged
A block data size always one size aligned byte
This dynamic allocator knowledge alignment used provide aligned buffer price factor two space loss

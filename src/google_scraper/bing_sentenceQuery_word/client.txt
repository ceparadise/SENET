may run client computer
The term client may also applied computer device run client software user use client software
A client part still used today
Clients server may computer program run machine connect via technique
Combined program may connect service operating possibly remote system
Servers wait potential client initiate connection may accept
The term first applied capable running could interact remote computer via network
These client

Imagine customer sitting restaurant
He waiting server come take order
The rule apply network client laptop desktop smartphone pretty much computerized device make request server
The client us way connect speak server
Just customer speaks server client us network send receive communication order request
The server take request make sure request valid
If everything check okay server fetch request serve client
The server make request client well
It may want check status client ask received security patch still need resource server
If server close connection order free network traffic
Can imagine server standing next customer stare menu without ordering anything
After minute would good idea server leave check customer
In case server move client needed
The biggest advantage using setup central management server
Only one server used host resource client request use
This especially good server administrator one place solve problem one place well

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I wondering someone knew origin client server model
Where term come paper software application book
This good question
It appears term commonly used already
For example published already us term seems common use already back
However term context seems much recent earliest reference I able find
The following paper seems earliest hit I find full text paper
It seems published Proceedings held October
A preview available I quoting relevant part emphasis mine The distributed file system DFS named implemented cooperating set computer together create illusion single logical system
The computer network use DFS creating destroying randomly accessing file called employ term user stand human user program access DFS always called client
This look like good candidate first paper us terminology
Note way written author clearly assume reader familiar term server introducing unfamiliar term client strange justify use
I checked various resource including digital library IEEE ACM I able find hit predate
However already boldly using new term client title
Unsurprisingly citing Israel et al

earliest use Isreal et al
Here comment term server
Looking various paper written seems term server primarily used context server kind entity provides service
Whenever server computer mentioned computer science paper written typically related application queueing theory context computer system
Perhaps origin term field
I sure first instance server used sense without direct connection queueing theory
However RFC I mentioned seems already using term server context system computer network without explicit reference queueing theory
Of course term client introduced yet used word
Originally model computing little different dumb terminal mainframe earlier model later web browser backend web server model
With system sharing processing part system server handling data client retrieving data performing additional processing managing graphical display
One first example Oracle Forms released
An Oracle database server responded request network client running Oracle Forms application
Data management retrieval handled server client processed returned data user interface
It development Oracle Forms I first heard phrase used customer familiarisation event Oracle HQ Redwood Shores CA May
The word server client often mentioned previously coined linked together
Richard Moulding British company BT first started use phrase discussion
This quickly picked participant making way product literature hence general use computing community
Later system initially lighter client due simple web browser available
The client limited displaying interface prepared server
Later browser Java scripting tool enabled data manipulated browser similar model corporate system like Oracle Forms
Perhaps easier understand computing distributed processing one look history networking
The ARPAnet came using Honeywell minicomputer message processor
By ARPAnet supported transferring file across network
Digital Equipment Corporation DEC released DECnet
It supported network connection LAN WAN minicomputer mainframe providing functionality file transfer remote logins virtual terminal
In late Datapoint shipped ARCnet LAN supported resource sharing file serving
Before IBM PC arrived number company selling system computer
Those micro system typically floppy drive
Because hard drive expensive demand solution sharing hard disk
Several company jumped market file server product would enable computer share hard drive
Local area network operating system Novell Corvus supported file sharing computer IBM PC gained widespread acceptance later added disk printer sharing PCs
Novell founded initially manufactured sold hardware including smart terminal dot matrix printer Nexus workstation dollar
Novell claim fame Nexus product would eventually connect Novell LAN development
Novell printer terminal Nexus computer sell well Novell leadership decided company focused software file server board networking
Novell NetWare sale exploded
Novell predominant file server term sale first file server In Sybase founded introduced SQL architecture distributed processing SQL database server application running client sent query request server

architecture many remote processor request receive service centralized host computer
Client computer provide interface allow computer user request service server display result server return
Servers wait request arrive client respond
Ideally server provides standardized transparent interface client client need aware specific system providing service
Clients often situated server located elsewhere network usually powerful machine
This computing model especially effective client server distinct task routinely perform
In example client computer running application program entering patient information server computer running another program manages information permanently stored
Many client access server information simultaneously time client computer perform task sending
Because client server computer considered intelligent device model completely different old model centralized mainframe computer performed task associated dumb terminal

The developed century supplied designing circuit binary input value false true respectively terminology logic yield desired combination output
Theoretical work computability began provided needed extension design whole machine milestone specification theoretical device manipulates string British mathematician model computational power
Another breakthrough concept computer usually credited mathematician
This instruction well data stored fast access critical development modern computer
Previous thinking limited calculator approach instruction entered one time
The need user application provided main driving force early day computer science still great extent today
The difficulty writing program led first development allows programmer use instruction ADD symbol variable
Such program translated program known assembler binary encoding used computer

In particular interactive information interchange also known dialogue conversation meeting two communicating device computer user see
A session set established certain point time torn later point
An established communication session may involve one message direction
A session typically always meaning least one communicating part need save information session history order able communicate opposed communication communication consists independent request response
An established session basic requirement perform
A session also basic step transmit mode
However unidirectional transmission define session
may implemented part protocol service
In case transport protocol implement formal session layer session application layer generally HTTP session maintained higher level program using method defined data exchanged
For example HTTP exchange browser remote host may include identifies state unique information user preference authorization level
thought allow single request response one Session
Protocol version improved completing CGI making easier maintain Web Session supporting file uploads
Most session maintained transport layer single connection single session
However transaction phase session creates separate connection
Maintaining session continuity phase requires
The embedded within A HREF FORM link passed back CGI
CGI us ensure session continuity transaction phase
One advantage one work well low bandwidth modem connection
TCP session typically implemented software using new process thread created computer establishes join session
HTTP session typically implemented using one thread per session mean database information state session
The advantage multiple process thread relaxed complexity software since thread history encapsulated variable
The disadvantage large overhead term system resource session may interrupted system restarted
When client may connect server cluster server special problem encountered maintaining consistency server must maintain session state
The client must either directed server duration session server must transmit session information via shared file system database
Otherwise client may reconnect different server one started session cause problem new server access stored state old one
session handy efficient become difficult handle conjunction system usable embedded system storage
The problem solved using shared storage applying forced peering client single server cluster although compromise system efficiency load distribution
A method using session system without reserve portion RAM storage session data
This method applicable server limited number client
router access point infrequent disallowed access one client time
session use cooky cryptographic technique maintain state without storing much data server
When presenting dynamic web page server sends current state data client web browser form cookie
The client save cookie memory disk
With successive request client sends cookie back server server us data remember state application specific client generate appropriate response
This mechanism may work well context however data stored client vulnerable tampering user software access client computer
To use session confidentiality integrity required following must guaranteed To accomplish server need encrypt session data sending client modification information party prevented via cryptographic mean
Transmitting state back forth every request practical size cookie small
In essence session trade server disk space extra bandwidth web request require
Moreover web browser limit number size cooky may stored web site
To improve efficiency allow session data server may compress data creating cookie decompressing later cookie returned client
A session token unique identifier generated sent identify current interaction session
The client usually store sends token sends parameter GET POST query
The reason use session token client handle session data stored server usually client direct access linked identifier
Examples name programming language use naming HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID PHPSESSID CGISESSID ASPSESSIONID
In process keeping track user activity across session interaction
Typical session management task include keeping track application open document application opened state restored user log log later
For website session management might involve requiring user session expired certain time limit passed without user activity
It also used store information HTTP request
A desktop session manager program save restore desktop session
A desktop session window currently running current content
Session management system provided
On system session management provided Session Manager Subsystem user session functionality extended application like
Session management particularly useful user save open page setting restore later date
To help recover system application crash page setting also restored next run
example web browser support session management
Session management often managed application
HTTP stateless client computer running web browser must establish new TCP network connection web server new HTTP GET POST request
The web server therefore rely established TCP network connection longer single HTTP GET POST operation
Session management technique used web developer make stateless HTTP protocol support session state
For example user authenticated web server user next HTTP request GET POST cause web server ask user account password
For discussion method used accomplish see In situation multiple web server must share knowledge session state typical environment session information must shared cluster node running web server software
Methods sharing session state node cluster include multicasting session information member node see one example technique sharing session information partner node using sharing session information node using network socket storing session information shared file system storing session information outside cluster
If session information considered transient volatile data required transaction contain data subject compliance auditing example see example two law necessitate compliance auditing method storing session information used
However session information subject audit compliance consideration given method used session storage replication clustering
In Simple Object Access Protocol message constructed Extensible Markup Language message used consumer application cause web server create session
Just HTTP stateless protocol
As SMS became interoperable across rival network text messaging started ascent towards becoming ubiquitous global form communication various enterprise became interested using SMS channel commercial purpose
Initial service require session management since communication example
Today application referred distinct messaging
The development interactive enterprise application required session management SMS stateless protocol defined GSM standard early implementation controlled enter command service identifier manually

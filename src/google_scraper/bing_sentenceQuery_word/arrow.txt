In used describe fashion
First proposed computer scientist generalization arrow provide way expressing relationship step computation
Unlike monad arrow limit step one one input
As result found use among application
While arrow use recognized distinct class Hughes would publish first definition
Until monad proven sufficient problem requiring combination program logic pure code
However useful library certain efficient parser defied rewriting monadic form
The formal concept arrow developed explain exception monadic code process monad turned arrow
Since arrow active area research
Their underlying law operation refined several time recent formulation arrow calculus requiring five law
In form proper subset Hughes arrow
While believed arrow time since proven arrow even general
In fact arrow merely equivalent directly equal Freyd category
Like type class arrow thought set quality applied
In arrow allow represented Haskell symbol combine form
However actual term arrow may also come fact arrow correspond also known arrow category theory different Kleisli category
As relatively new concept single standard definition formulation logically equivalent feature required method strictly obey certain mathematical law
The description currently used Haskell two basic operation Although two procedure strictly necessary define arrow method derived make arrow easier work practice theory
As arrow third operation class category One helpful method derived combination previous three In addition procedure arrow must obey certain rule type may applied The remaining law restrict piping method behaves order composition reversed also allowing simplifying Arrows may extended fit specific situation defining additional operation restriction
Commonly used version include arrow choice allow computation make decision arrow allow step take output input
Another set arrow known arrow application rarely used practice actually equivalent monad
Arrows several benefit mostly stemming ability make program logic explicit yet concise
Besides avoiding creates opportunity
This turn theoretically lead better easier feature like
Although program strictly requires arrow generalize away much dense pure declarative code would otherwise require
They also encourage giving common linkage program step class definition
The ability apply type generically also contributes reusability keep simple
Arrows disadvantage including initial effort defining arrow satisfies arrow law
Because monad usually easier implement extra feature arrow may unnecessary often preferable use monad
Another issue applies many construct efficiently code arrow style used computer

The section entitled following code mean
assignment operator language use single equal sign equality testing
The well known language Pascal
Due C influence language switched assignment testing
Some older text author trained style use pseudocode
You sometimes see arrow well
From article Some modern language use arrow assignment notably us global assignment whilst using single equal local assignment
From Sebesta Concepts Programming Languages class note King learn assignment standard go back much farther C Pascal
It appears Algol designed decided use assignment
The commitee composed American European representative
Some Germans committee familiar Konrad Zuse Plankalkul language drafted World War II published implemented wanted assignment follow language proposed assignment method assigned
The committee changed ground method entering program time called keypunch use
So compromised equal colon
However Americans familiar FORTRAN lower case wanted assignment operate left since FORTRAN
So managed get changed instead assignment operate toward left rather right style FORTRAN known implemented language rather Plankalkul virtually unknown language outside Germany implemented
Algol strongly influenced major subsequent imperative language including Pascal Thus Pascal kept ALGOL syntax assignment kept lefthandedness assignment
ALGOL designed easy read close mathematical notation
It de facto basically de jure standard writing algorithm journal next year
Therefore instructor computer scientist educated around would familiar style notation
The release allowed character thus prompting inclusion C among others
Just quick pedantic note
quite informal mean want mean
As others said specific language Pascal use assignment avoid confusion equality whereas language use combination purpose
As far actual concerned use equal assigned receives whatever float boat long consistent usage context within pseudocode clear
I guessing assignment I think assignment operator Delphi x assigning value x
But AFAIK thing theory could anything
It usually mean thing mean mathematics assignment

Flowcharts ideal diagram visually representing business process
For example need show flow process various department within organization use flowchart
This paper provides visual representation basic flowchart symbol proposed use communicating structure web site well correlation developing instructional project
A typical flowchart older Computer Science textbook may following kind symbol
may contain symbol usually represented circle represent converging path flow chart
Circles one arrow coming one going
Some flow chart may arrow pointing another arrow instead
These useful represent iterative process Computer Science called loop
A loop may example consists connector control first enters processing step conditional one arrow exiting loop one going back connector
connector often used signify connection part process held another sheet screen
A flowchart described page divided different lane describing control different organization unit
An unit appearing particular lane within control organizational unit
This technique allows analyst locate responsibility performing action making decision correctly allowing relationship different organizational unit responsibility single process
Flowcharts use special shape represent different type action step process
Lines arrow show sequence step relationship
See use instantly
refer individual web page may may contain multiple element
Workflow relationship work done different department fixed sequence
This mean one department need finish job work continue another department
The development maintenance work flow relationship important manager depend preceding area work responsible manager worker different stage chain
The following shape similar basic flowchart symbol specially used audit flowchart
Edraw Max perfect flowchart organizational chart mind map also network diagram floor plan workflow fashion design UML diagram electrical diagram science illustration chart graph beginning

Graphs mathematical concept found many us computer science
Graphs come many different flavor many found us computer program
Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part
Edge labeled graph usually drawn label drawn adjacent arc specifying edge
Here following part
Here following part
Here following part
Vertices like called sink
Vertices like called source
Here following part
Graphs often used represent physical entity network road relationship people etc inside computer
There numerous mechansims used

Possible operation include
Not program need operation program efficent representation compute operation needed others suffice
represented function
We could represent Dgraph follows In rest note assume Vertices type Vertices set finite range type
Thus graph represented follows There many many algorithm graph

Pseudocode way writing code
It used design phase project quick way devising algorithm language used known without needing spend much time using exact syntax correct
Once pseudocode algorithm written easier use help write program code
Pseudocode structured way writing algorithm look much like program code
When devising algorithm programmer need use variable assign value
Many language require variable defined given data type use
The five basic data type used include Assigning value variable indicated pseudocode using arrow symbol
The arrow point value assigned towards variable assigned
The following line pseudocode read becomes equal
totalling
Sum Sum Number counting
Count Count The assignment operator also used finding total shown following example x becomes equal plus b
Similarly also use assignment operator counting assigning variable become equal value plus
INPUT OUTPUT
READ PRINT Output act returning data user program
This could form written message numerical value image video sound
This shown pseudocode writing OUTPUT followed output
The example show would output message World Sometimes word PRINT may used instead OUTPUT following example Input hand expect value provided user
The following example output message asking user input name assign variable called
The word READ also used instead INPUT
The use selection allows decision made within algorithm based certain condition
An IF statement start condition tested
If condition evaluates TRUE THEN code block run
If condition evaluates false ELSE block run
In following example Hello printed x otherwise Goodbye printed
Often ELSE IF used one condition check
The following example would print Hello x How
x otherwise print Goodbye
This structure used many possible outcome condition
For instance extend example suppose wanted program print different message depending value variable xː In example x print Hello x How
x I fine
x print Have good dayǃ
If x equal anything else print Goodbye
Iteration used need repeat block code
We make code block repeat either given number repetition continuously either long condition continues true condition becomes true
The FOR loop used repeat code given number repetition
We specify counter variable set initial value specify end value
After every iteration loop counter variable automatically incremented
In following example x start increase every time code repeat reach value loop terminate
A REPEAT loop repeat code block given condition true
The condition checked code run regardless whether condition true code always run least
The following example continue take user input user input value le
This structure often used validation check
In WHILE loop code block run continue run given condition longer true
A WHILE loop similar REPEAT loop decides terminate based condition
However loop check condition prior running first time
If condition true code block never run
The example also used input validation
Flowcharts alternative pseudocode
They used describe algorithm form diagram
Different symbol used represent different structure described
Below example flowchart algorithm

The dot operator used access member struct arrow operator C used access member struct referenced pointer question
The pointer member could accessed dot operator actually number describing location virtual memory member
So would ambiguity defined dot operator automatically dereference pointer used pointer information known compiler compile time afaik
So language creator decided make thing complicated adding seemingly unnecessary operator
What big design decision
I interpret question two question even exists automatically dereference pointer
Answers question historical root
In one first version C language I refer CRM came Edition Unix May operator exclusive meaning synonymous combination The C language described CRM different modern C many respect
In CRM struct member implemented global concept could added address value type restriction

name struct member independent global meaning therefore unique
For example could declare name would stand offset name would stand offset assuming type size padding
The language required member structs translation unit either unique name stand offset value

translation unit could additionally declare would OK since name would consistently stand offset
But additional declaration would formally invalid since attempted redefine offset offset
And operator come
Since every struct member name global meaning language supported expression like The first assignment interpreted compiler take address add offset assign value resultant address

would assign value address
Note use care type expression side
The left hand side interpreted rvalue numerical address pointer integer
This sort trickery possible combination
You could since already invalid expression
The operator since separate imposes strict type requirement operand
To provide capability work around limitation CRM introduced operator independent type operand
As Keith noted comment difference combination CRM referring relaxation requirement Later K R C many feature originally described CRM significantly reworked
The idea struct member global offset identifier completely removed
And functionality operator became fully identical functionality combination
Again CRM version language left operand operator required
That requirement imposed operand made different explained
Note CRM require left operand struct type
It required lvalue lvalue
This mean CRM version C could write code like In case compiler would write value positioned continuous memory block known even though type field named
The compiler would care actual type
All cared lvalue sort writable memory block
Now note code would considered valid since also lvalue compiler would simply attempt write data
Needless say thing like could easily result memory overrun language concern matter

version language proposed idea overloading operator pointer type would work operator already specific meaning used pointer lvalue pointer lvalues
It weird functionality doubt
But time
Of course weird functionality strong reason introducing overloaded operator pointer suggested reworked version C K R But done
Maybe time legacy code written CRM version C supported
The URL C Reference Manual may stable
Another copy possibly subtle difference
Beyond historical good already reported reason also little problem operator precedence dot operator higher priority star operator struct containing pointer struct containing pointer struct
These two equivalent But second clearly readable
Arrow operator highest priority dot associate left right
I think clearer use dot operator pointer struct struct know type expression without look declaration could even another file
C also good job making anything ambiguous
Sure dot could overloaded mean thing arrow make sure programmer know operating pointer like compiler wo let mix two incompatible type
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

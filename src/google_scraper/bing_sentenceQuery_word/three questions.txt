The chapter called Admissions Financial Aid describes transfer policy general term
Your transfer work evaluated required document received
All transfer student initially admitted University College
Please check transfer articulation agreement
If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution

This post meant help computer science undergraduate looking software engineering internship summer
Applying internship daunting post hopefully address commonly asked question I see Reddit
Along miscellanea regarding application post cover two thing I last summer summer first time seriously looking internship
From beginning September beginning January around week I lot interviewing technical interview four recruiter interview two coding challenge one product manager interview one trader interview involuntarily moved software engineering
One reason I many interview I poorly many interview first month
Despite read interviewing internet I wish I known prepare
Finally note I mostly interviewed medium large company Silicon Valley mileage may vary local company smaller startup
Out respect company I interviewed I linking specific company specific interview question
I would categorize internship interview falling one three category I explain depth adding detail prepare category
Note every interview fall precisely one three category interview mix multiple category
The common type interview especially interviewing specific team
This people envision computer science interview asked one programming question implement solution collaborative editor like
I would divide interview two topic I think first category easier includes question like
Even immediately know answer chance figure without requiring knowledge specific algorithm data structure
I find second category trickier sometimes question hard near impossible know specific data structure algorithm
For example never done tree traversal asked question I received two different company question much harder
In one interview I poorly delved deeply variation hash table I familiar basic linked list hash table
At end every question almost always asked discus complexity implementation
Here I realize first instead walking
Unless algorithmic challenge regular basis worth time read practice
I would take book like grain salt
Except big company like Facebook interview question internship generally much easier senior developer
You asked write tree scratch
From experience list comprehensively cover topic interview experience suggestion welcome
search DFS BFS respectively extremely popular I would estimate
Know
The pleasant conversation interviewer get opportunity talk resume project
I found type interview common small medium sized company
Empirically I better interview algorithmic interview opportunity pitch passionate developer
I usually talked research past internship experience
Note I junior third year undergraduate student
If freshman sophomore panic lot talk yet
Without sideprojects past internship however interview tough
You use course project I think people know course project file hacked together day varies school course
Be prepared talk job project resume
For project want ready answer question What project
What scope project
much time big What role project
What learn
What challenge project
If prepare answer ready answer general question frequently show interview Tell technical challenge
The interview test knowledge specific language claim know resume
This interview often show placed interview specific team iOS Safari team Apple YUI team Yahoo
I never asked coding question interview interviewer expected show knowledge answer quiz question discussion relevant project opinion language feature
If placed interview team us specific language framework prepare following question
I asked multiple occasion What make language different language
If change something language would change
Tell technical challenge working project language
In addition question I also asked following question three different occasion internship Tell closure JavaScript
I usually answered explanation callback function scope JavaScript
Closures allow traditional programming object closure
One question I asked interview recite value various context mean fair game
Again every interview fall one three category
I encountered couple weird interview style Some bigger company dive straight technical part interview interviewer ask important question variant prepare Tell
Keep succinct
I would say minute long
Hit important point interest experience spare interviewer life story
I saying I made mistake long pitch first interview I could tell interviewer ended getting bored
Even interview run allocated time interviewer ask Do question
I used lot trouble I started treating opportunity conversation became much easier
This chance connect personal level interviewer
If performance borderline insightful conversation interviewer hurt
If interviewer described yet first thing I asked Can tell
I let conversation flow
If much follow I ask test product choose target new feature
There Programmers Stack Exchange although suitable potential intern ask
These answer question either I asking beginning application process I see frequently asked
Most answer
How long resume
For company based US resume longer one page
Personally I like reading resume longer one page
From I read various recruiter manager internet either although mean automatic rejection
Make sure resume look professional spacing font structure
Use serif font
If resume long consider cutting part tech related club extracurriculars experience different field
Finally include thing like high school GPA matter people reading resume
When I start applying
Most internship application started popping October November
I think hurt apply earlier although one friend told intern candidate company usually fared better spring fall
Before last summer I already decided research I receive email interview late March
If jump October panic
How important sideprojects
It depends company freshman first year sophomore second year important
When I applied first internship freshman spring recruiter emailed back saying manager wanted know I sideprojects
In addition spicing resume give something substantive talk done interview
How long take hear back interview
It varies company
From small medium sized company I heard back anywhere day week
Without exception final round interview took every big company two week month respond either offer rejection
How I overcome nervousness interview
In algorithmic interview I started poorly I would freeze ramble especially I slept much previous night schoolwork
Eventually interviewer would pretty much tell answer almost always led rejection interview
If happens advice tell interviewer Let consolidate thought Take deep breath think anything tackle question
If feel nervous beginning try persuade friendly conversation
How I know well interview went
In experience interviewer start talking much responsibility intern explicitly ask interview probably went well
This guarantee mean
I read thing internet asking interviewer felt interview went
I tried feel free let know
I think would useful source feedback
Hope help

An alternate succinct definition computer science study automating algorithmic process scale
A specializes theory computation design computational system
Its field divided variety theoretical
Some field explores fundamental property intractable problem highly abstract field emphasize visual application
Other field still focus challenge implementing computation
For example considers various approach description computation study investigates various aspect use
considers challenge making computer computation useful usable human
The earliest foundation would become computer science predate invention modern
Machines calculating fixed numerical task existed since antiquity aiding computation multiplication division
Further performing computation existed since antiquity even development sophisticated computing equipment

In demonstrated digital mechanical calculator called
He may considered first computer scientist information theorist among reason documenting binary number system
In launched industry released simplified first calculating machine strong enough reliable enough used daily office environment
started design first eventually gave idea first
He started developing machine le two year sketched many salient feature modern computer
A crucial step adoption punched card system derived making infinitely programmable
In translation French article Analytical Engine wrote one many note included algorithm compute considered first computer program
Around invented used process statistical information eventually company became part
In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software
formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation made representative ACM IEEE CS four area considers crucial discipline computer science
In addition four area CSAB also identifies field software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation important area computer science
mathematical abstract spirit derives motivation practical everyday computation

The field often involves discipline computer engineering electrical engineering selecting interconnecting hardware component create computer meet functional performance cost goal
Computer performance analysis study work flowing computer general goal improving controlling using resource efficiently eliminating predicting performance anticipated peak load
Concurrency property system several computation executing simultaneously potentially interacting
A number mathematical model developed general concurrent computation including model
A distributed system extends idea concurrency onto multiple computer connected network
Computers within distributed system private memory information often exchanged among achieve common goal
This branch computer science aim manage network computer worldwide
Computer security branch computer technology whose objective includes protection information unauthorized access disruption modification maintaining accessibility usability system intended user
Cryptography practice study hiding encryption therefore deciphering decryption information
Modern cryptography largely related computer science many encryption decryption algorithm based computational complexity
A database intended organize store retrieve large amount data easily
Digital database managed using database management system store create maintain search data
Computer graphic study digital visual content involves synthesis manipulation image data
The study connected many field computer science including heavily applied field special effect
Research develops theory principle guideline user interface designer create satisfactory user experience desktop laptop mobile device
field study concerned constructing technique using computer analyze solve problem
In practical use typically application form problem various scientific discipline
Artificial intelligence AI aim required synthesize process environmental adaptation learning communication found human animal
From origin artificial intelligence research necessarily drawing area expertise
AI associated popular mind main field practical application embedded component area require computational understanding
The late question Can computer think
question remains effectively unanswered although still used ass computer output scale human intelligence
But automation evaluative predictive task increasingly successful substitute human monitoring intervention domain computer application involving complex data
Software engineering study designing implementing modifying software order ensure high quality affordable maintainable fast build
It systematic approach software design involving application engineering practice software
Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

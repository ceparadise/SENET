I grew ultimate goal pursue BSc Computer Science took goal met mistake submitting country required choice study education system document I
I ended enrolled BSc Economics course I particularly interested
My specific situation might generally applicable worldwide audience Internet technical study becoming ubiquitous
Computer Science however stop flying around mind I sure someone might facing dilemma I faced year ago point represent thought advice I believe might useful people The problem I learning thing I liked thing I try
The answer really simple stop thinking studying Computer Science probably study Computer Science
How know actually tried
You play safe
Start short online introductory course programming algorithm
Coursera time start get idea like code
Ruby would good language start simple avoids many complexity language
Watch video program along start getting excited would probably enjoy studying Computer Science
On hand like Computer Science get passionate coding possible area may suited Technical Writing
Writing documentation
This would require bit technical knowledge actually know writing spot error
Either way Computer Science change way think
During BSc I idea I would make possible convert computing
I realised however change line thinking either going back school another BSc rather finding role unrelated personality potential
It old saying picking something like well people pay
I knew I many year steer towards goal many year benefit advantage another degree I wanted take bigger risk find way exact moment
My thinking process fairly simple I experienced A lead believe B B true I take action I experienced studying something I like I change lead hypothesis faster I would graduate quicker I would dive thing I liked proper CS course
I accepted hypothesis true I graduated highest mark BSc I I wanted apply accepted really good BSc CS degree abroad
I time ready spend another year life starting moment I realised I could convert month
There Ivy League MSc Computer Science conversion course widely known
Their entry requirement involve good undergraduate degree strong passion Computer Science exactly I needed
These month course really intensive challenging life changing time
If passionate programming find course interesting logical importantly memorable
The actual studying homework programming assignment medium hard difficulty may seem paced bit fast push achieve great thing
Go designated prerequisite disastrous ignore prerequisite advise tremendously useful follow
Make sure understand code term math programming abstract thinking bug group project programming multiple computer language
A thing I realised converting Computing You WILL make mistake point find early learn identify even earlier next time move take personally
Make sure accept actively seek offer input colleague especially think input needed
New tool platform requirement APIs likely appear month month beauty technology
Just smile face new challenge
Attend hackathons competition coding finding smart solution interest problem coder know create something scratch
Having completed project show great way showcase work ability
Jack Kelly PhD student Computer Science My first degree Neuroscience
I adore reading science quite enjoy Neuroscience research
But I much prefer building useful thing constantly figuring little puzzle computing allows every day Konstantinos Kamnitsas MSc CS Conversion Course said In Computing easy realise idea
All need initial spark computer implement
No need expensive construct something like previous

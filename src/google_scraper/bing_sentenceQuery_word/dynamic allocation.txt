I need help allocating array dynamically
I array whose size keep changing step I start row vector add another row vector step cycle
I need use new array calculation
I trying declare array allocatable allocate within I able get working properly
I still clear happens deallocate memory particular array
If data lost store deallocation I use another array
How I specify size array
Any help would greatly appreciated
Yes deallocate memory must regard longer existent
In Fortran earlier wish expand array must copy data another array deallocate array reallocate copy portion back
Fortran provides intrinsic procedure simplifies process

As requirement wireless service keep growing number variant wireless standard increase consequently imposes increasing stress fixed limited radio spectrum
However extensive measurement reported indicate large part licensed band low utilization show Figure
Spectrum utilization strongly depended place time
Fixed spectrum allocation waste resource
Figure Spectrum Utilization Nowadays application require bandwidth better service
Electromagnetic spectrum however kind limited natural resource well water crude oil
Recent study noted poor utilization traditional exclusive spectrum assignment
An intuitional way improve sparse usage allow unlicensed user access resource idle time
We improve efficiency allowing unlicensed user exploit spectrum whenever would cause interference licensed user
Why A fixed spectrum fraction assigned licensed holder long term basis large geographical region
Figure show fixed spectrum assignment different standard
Figure Spectrum Assignment policy According Federal Communications Commission FCC exclusive assignment limit usage result many spectrum hole also called white space
It show traffic wireless network concentrate particular frequency particular region particular time significant amount spectrum remains unused
Throughout whole spectrum utilization varies frequency time geographic domain
Much worse time certain portion licensed band unoccupied
As user demand better quality service higher data rate efficient spectrum usage becoming critical issue
There numerous protocol standard wireless spectrum rely static spectrum allocation policy licensed spectrum band statically assigned specific licensed service user
Once spectrum band assigned certain service allocation allowed change
However new concept dynamic spectrum allocation become necessary overcome critical limitation traditional static al location scheme
Recent study shown use static spectrum allocation degraded spectral efficiency significantly
Moreover current standard guarantee prevention unexpected interruption wireless network user
To alleviate problem FCC recently suggested new concept cognitive radio network CRNs serf framework realizing dynamic spectrum allocation
It requires enhancement current PHY MAC protocol adopt feature
The basic idea spectrum agility allow secondary user SUs unlicensed user access licensed spectrum band far produce undesirable interference licensed user
To achieve goal SUs must monitor channel acirc usage pattern PUs identify spectrum hole opportunity exploit
Whenever SUs find channel utilized without interfering PUs assigned shared SUs
The SUs also responsible monitoring returning PUs channel currently using promptly vacate channel case
There two major advantage using unlicensed spectrum
First requirement register using spectrum deployment fast cost effective well
Second major advantage using unlicensed spectrum shared among user indeed useful wireless system device dynamically change position like notebook cell phone etc
It would practical require owner portable device acquire license cover every place may ever wish system operate
Fixed application transmit sporadically fluctuating rate also make efficient use unlicensed spectrum one transmitting another
It shown cellular system could carry significantly traffic shared spectrum dynamically provided competing firm willing adopt cooperative strategy serve common interest
Metropolitan area network carrying bursty data traffic could expect even greater efficiency gain competing network motivated adopt technique
The industrial scientific medical ISM radio band originally reserved internationally use RF electromagnetic field industrial scientific medical purpose communication
Figure show spectrum ISM band
Figure ISM Band There many factor raise interest using band time consuming standardization
Also requirement registering user using band particular restriction user usage user use product anywhere place
There license fee band device using band cost effective
Many wireless communication standard aimed use unlicensed ISM band easier coexist existing wireless network assign new separate empty spectrum
Currently spectrum wireless communication saturated
There heavy interference competition ISM band many wireless device flow frequency area
On contrary spectrum TV broadcasting digital TV wireless microphone tend inactive depend device acirc location time
In TV broadcasting spectrum busy TV broadcasting hour one use spectrum broadcasting sign
Also TV spectrum changed compliance localization
The GHz ISM band become particularly popular last year household virtually commercial building likely equipment operates band
Applications include wireless LANs Bluetooth infrared device short range communication Advanced Traveler Information Management Systems like door opener garage home audio system cordless phone remote control etc
IEEE Working Group came November purpose making standard wireless regional area network WRAN capable using cognitive radio technology
According technical specification WRAN system operate TV band ranging MHz MHz
The target WRAN provide wireless broadband access average coverage radius km go
The main target make unlicensed access unused TV spectrum
In particular WRAN system able sense spectrum identify unused TV channel utilize channel provide broadband service fixed wireless subscriber
While must make sure undesirable interference licensed user
Figure show WRAN standard application
Figure WRAN IEEE standard Wireless Regional Area Network WRAN us unused spectrum spectrum whole TV frequency spectrum basis
This standard developed intent give broadband internet coverage rural area acceptable performance comparing performance DSL cable modem
The television spectrum selected application due propagation characteristic
Cognitive radio reuse TV spectrum opportunistic way detecting channel occupied using
Due rapid growth wireless service various wireless standard developed becoming cause major stress fixed limited spectrum
However fixed spectrum result low utilization spectrum resource per spectrum assignment policy
Now day application require spectrum efficient service
The fixed spectrum convenient service
Therefore problem improved efficiently allowing unlicensed user exploit spectrum whenever would cause interference licensed user
The fixed spectrum policy relies static spectrum allocation policy licensed spectrum band statically assigned specific licensed service user allocation allowed change
In order solve issue new concept dynamic spectrum allocation also known unlicensed spectrum policy become necessary overcome critical limitation traditional static allocation scheme
To make concept efficient new technology called cognitive radio technology developed
The basic idea behind technology allow secondary user SUs access licensed spectrum band far cause harmful interference primary user PUs
The unlicensed spectrum two major advantage one fast cheap deployment unlicensed spectrum shared
As sharing essential wireless network many wireless communication standard aimed use unlicensed ISM band complete absence user restriction easier coexist existing wireless network allocate new empty spectrum
Cognitive radio technology used WRAN developed IEEE working group give broadband service rural area performance statistic comparable DSL cable modem utilizing white space basis

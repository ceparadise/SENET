In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

A superscalar architecture given previous figure b I wonder functional unit control logic cpu mean
Does superscalar architecture also replicate control logic
Are functional unit Execute unit thing
Is control logic Fetch unit Decode unit
I hesitant answer yes question following reason
The text say superscalar architecture replicate functional unit multithreading replicates functional unit also control logic
But figure b superscalar one multiple fetch decode unit besides multiple execute unit I sure control logic fetch decode unit functional unit execute unit
Also multithreading text actually mean
I know replicating control logic necessary
Ca multiple thread process share control unit fetch unit decode unit different time
Yes context used book
In computer engineering also called part CPU performs operation calculation called computer program
It may internal control sequence unit confused CPUs main control unit register internal unit FPU smaller specific component
It common modern CPUs multiple parallel execution unit referred scalar superscalar design
The simplest arrangement use one bus manager manage memory interface others perform calculation

data sent ALU storing resulting data back control coordinate interworks
Source The first step fetch involves retrieving instruction represented number sequence number program memory
The instruction location address program memory determined program counter PC store number identifies address next instruction fetched
After instruction fetched PC incremented length instruction contain address next instruction sequence
Often instruction fetched must retrieved relatively slow memory causing CPU stall waiting instruction returned
This issue largely addressed modern processor cache pipeline architecture see
The instruction CPU fetch memory determines CPU
In decode step instruction broken part significance portion CPU
The way numerical instruction value interpreted defined CPU instruction set architecture ISA
e Often one group number instruction called opcode indicates operation perform
The remaining part number usually provide information required instruction operand addition operation
Such operand may given constant value called immediate value place locate value register memory address determined addressing mode
In CPU design instruction decoder implemented hardwired unchangeable circuit
In others microprogram used translate instruction set CPU configuration signal applied sequentially multiple clock pulse
In case memory store microprogram rewritable making possible change way CPU decodes instruction
Source Information RAM sent along BIU make copy sends cache

The pattern widely used approach describing structure information processing program process
Many introductory programming system analysis text introduce basic structure describing process
A sort process using model receives input user source computation input return result computation
In essence system separate environment thus defining input output one united mechanism
The system would divide work two category In word input may material human resource money information transformed output consumables service new information money
As consequence system becomes vulnerable misinterpretation
This theoretically contains data regard environment outside system yet practice environment contains significant variety object system unable comprehend exists outside system control
As result important understand boundary lie system environment beyond system understanding
This often various analyst would set boundary favouring point view thus creating much confusion
The view differ regard system thinking
One definition would outline system structure would Systems thinking art science making reliable inference behaviour developing increasingly deep understanding understanding underlying structure Alternatively also suggested system sense bonding remote object example trying connect crab ozone layer capital life cycle together
There five major category cited information system literature A system created result human interference
Examples would solar system well human body evolving current form A system created result human interference physically identifiable
Examples would various computing machine created human mind specific purpose
A system created result human interference physically identifiable
Examples would mathematical philosophical system created human mind specific purpose
There also social system allow human collectively achieve specific purpose
A system created human derived intangible purpose
For example family hierarchy human relationship essence create boundary natural human system
An organisation hierarchy created human specific purpose
For example company organises human together collaborate achieve specific purpose
The result system physically identifiable
There however significant link previous type
It clear idea human activity system HAS would consist variety smaller social system unique development organisation
Moreover arguably HASes include designed system computer machinery
Majority previous system would overlap
There several key characteristic come fundamental behaviour system

To interact computer use external device called peripheral device way computer receive give information user without computer practically useless need input output device first path computer organization
First input input device human communicate data computer various way therefor give task processed output
After input data done computer need store able process output le amount storage capacity CPU Central Processing Unit storage device purpose storing large amount data CPU access data easily faster
Output final step result given output device computer also need storage device
We see detail main us device
And way operates human computer
Definition An input device peripheral hardware device generally external connected remotely connected computer information appliance
Input device used provide input understood computer raw data information command order To process input computer absolutely need input device important part computer
Categories Input device category four category Typing device Pointing device Optical device Audio device These category represent way communicate computer first path phase
Typing Devices Typing device essentially keyboard used insert text command via button
They effective way input data computer
use method binary code input data
Typing device reliable text number data input
But ergonomically unsafe properly used inaccurate difficult bad typist paralysis handicapped user Basically computer posse keyboard primary input computer system
Pointing Devices Pointing device used input data movement example pointing device mouse joystick stylus touch screen
They usually used operate screen movement based information manually used easy manipulate due simple movement like mouse consist pointing clicking
One main disadvantage limited task mouse joystick mean limited work touch screen le responsive compared keyboard
Optical Devices Optical device mostly used recognition video image capture field recognition OMR optical mark recognition OCR optical character recognition many others optical device like barcode reader scanner handheld scanner digital camera The OMR reader used barcode reader scan mark indicate data information input send computer processed also used face recognition finger print scanner retina scanner
The OCR text character recognition scanning text document
Basically optical device faster device reading used security mean due accuracy reliability
The disadvantage lie raw data instance single change optical device may recognize therefor give wrong output user Audio Devices Audio device like name indicate mainly input audio data
The device microphone headset MIDI process analogue digital data convertor
It allows user send audio signal computer processing recording carrying command sometimes main purpose transfer input audio output audio
The disadvantage source audio bad signal process wrong
Definition Like input output device also peripheral hardware device used receive result processing date come input
All computer information system absolutely need output device
Output device also known way computer communicates human
Types Output There three principal type output device based way deliver output data Display output Physical output Audio output Display Output They commonly monitor screen light based device called Visual Display Unit VDU
It primary output device also used input device computer display content information screen permit user read see process done input data called soft copy mean temporary data copy
Display output device also wall without human ca understand computer try communicate
Usually display output called video display dimensional display like Television set Computer monitor Head mounted display But also called segment display composed several segment switch give appearance desired output display show numeric number alphanumeric character like calculator digital watch
The advantage display device see output computer program also use computer easily giving command Command Line Interface use Pointing device Mouse point click task Graphical User Interface GUI
It fast acquire economical easily transmittable
In another hand disadvantage output temporary need power supply cause visual problem user
Physical Output Physical output hard copy permanent output common way get printer
There two type printer Impact printer use typewriter approach impact ink ribbon paper

printer
printer use chemical technology produce colour printing

laser printer printer So printer principal output device term physical output produce printing produce large amount short time
The disadvantage cost printing expensive due hard copy compared soft copy need displayed
Audio Output Audio output device refer device attache computer purpose playing sound speech music
It also refer sound computer sound card
Here example audio output device us Speakers common type audio output device attached computer using variety audio plug
It requires separate energy supply operational
Headphones another type audio output device
Variations headphone concept include ear bud fit inside ear headset include headphone microphone
It requires separate power supply
Sound card computer component convert information digital audio file electronic sound signal
These signal passed audio output device speaker headphone
Although sound card play sound output audio signal
For reason considered audio output device
Without audio output device miss audio cue computer error beep important system message alerting system problem
This keep sync computer allowing effectively recognize identify issue
There real disadvantage audio output device need additional hardware sound card additional power supply possibility making noise
There primarily three type storage computer posse first primary storage popularly called simply memory secondary storage popularly referred simply storage finally offline storage referred movable storage
Primary Storage Primary storage computer store data temporary basis process data
Think primary storage short term memory
Primary storage type memory directly accessible computer processor volatile temporary nature erased power turned
The main primary storage RAM Random Access Memory ROM Read Only Memory Data computer currently processing data computer know need processing stored primary storage
Memory primary storage accessed quickly CPU
Its storage capacity however much smaller stored secondary tertiary storage
Computers need enough primary storage function temporarily hold anticipated amount data processing
Secondary Storage Secondary storage computer store data currently processing may need later time
Secondary storage thought long term memory storage nature data remains intact even power computer turned
Operating system document music file typically stored secondary storage device
They also external movement transport
The main device secondary storage hard disk drive HDD
The computer largest secondary storage location hard disk drive hard drive
Hard drive platter like dish stacked top middle bottom make one unit
Hard drive mechanical device store data magnetically
They considered permanent storage
Among advantage hard disk drive storage capability Megabyte Terabyte
Hard disk drive durable metal casing built around inner component
Hard disk drive
They read modified written
Offline storage Offline storage storage medium inserted computer used removed computer stored elsewhere
It also external source connected computer disconnected like floppy drive CD drive DVD drive USB flash drive drive
Floppy drive old form storage capacity Megabytes used nowadays categorised offline storage able read written
CD drive Compact Disk DVD drive Digital Video Disc store data shiny disc capacity CD drive Megabytes DVD drive Gigabytes Gigabytes double layer DVD compact portable storage good amount storage primary commercial storage device used video audio software game
But disadvantage infected virus used bad intention also layer disk get damaged like scratch computer able read anymore loss data
USB flash drive portable storage device great amount storage support Megabytes Gigabytes easiest way carry data place place due connectivity via USB port
Unfortunately USB flash drive fragile easily breakable easily get corrupted infected virus basically used short amount time useless
After describing explaining input output storage device see utilisation computer operation function process based within device without one work ca done
These interaction computer human necessary achieve perfect use computer studied field called interaction
Nowadays interaction appearing frequent daily life better speed accuracy due evolution technology human becoming reliable computer

Wassily Leontief witnessed history
He young boy country mourned death Leo Tolstoy
He saw Lenin talking crowd front Winter Palace
As young academic decided leave Russia escape censorship eventually moved United States develop would become important contribution economics
Before age computer Leontief started mapping flow good service different economic sector proved crucial learning economy interconnect global supply chain
The importance model increased time today still vital understanding economy
Sveriges Riksbank Prize Economic Sciences Memory Alfred Nobel Petersburg Russia New York New York USA Macroeconomics Development analysis method systematically analyze transaction economy Was offered work advisor Ministry Railroad Services Nanking beer Chinese gentleman Berlin pub Chose slowest way possible travel China took Japanese boat Marseilles Four doctoral student also Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson Robert Solow Vernon Smith Thomas Schelling Leontief ten year old Russian Revolution started replacement Czarist regime provisional government
He lived Leningrad Petersburg even old man still remembered would play friend street sometimes bullet would go
He shared vivid memory incredible hunger parent would barely eat anything son could
There even wood heat house
Life time extremely hard Leontief later said
What learned facing revolution
Politically easy time family
Leontief father professor economics studied Germany disagreed completely happening Russia Leontief
There great tension remembered
If one thing learned father speak freely
I definitely protesting side
I protested fellow student censorship
We printed leaflet deep night went pasting wall city
At age Leontief arrested first time due dispute friend strong defender Bolsheviks
Leontief sided faction socialist movement Mensheviks
Though time rough remembered life went
As young person I could take explained
People continue
But learned important lesson back hard life
It good lesson
A passionate reader Leontief took first important step towards successful academic career midst turbulent time
He given special permission admitted university early age starting study philosophy sociology eventually economics
He earned master degree year old
But Leontief soon realized able develop scientific career home country
Censors forbade publication academic article campaigned freedom speech institutional autonomy
And I wanted leave remembered
In Leontief got Germany
Stalin power year regime terror would reach peak
Leontief knew little German father study hard spent hour public library every day keep
Though extremely poor enjoyed every day
I bought bottle milk morning
And milk became sour also meal
But marvelous
Before Nazis took Leontief left United States
He already started systematic economic research still Institute World Economy Kiel engaged mostly statistical work supply demand curve
At Harvard University realized approach understand economy work
To study little piece use fancy statistical measure never understand economy
One must get fact I developed theory analyze
Leontief started work decade later would earn Nobel Prize Economic Sciences would turn academic
The economic system country like big computing machine Leontief said introduced
And often computer break
Find wrong computer good analysis
In general Leontief approach sought answer question economic sector activity affect
With analysis try describe happens economy
We show product distributed Leontief explained
He able depict first time economic history different industry interconnected sell buy
An economy like big computing machine Imagine economy consists two sector agriculture manufacturing
And also final consumption household
If deliver household increase output
And compute much additional product need
It complete system
If example increase production car Leontief could use table estimate much additional steel labor machinery input required
Leontief used cooking recipe analogy demonstrate analysis work
To make unit agricultural product pointed need unit unit look kitchen want make pound bread
Leontief knew course although cookbook easily understandable image theory would give wrong answer used make literal prediction
There also time lag something produced today input must produced year two year
It problem synchronization
That much modern theory business cycle involve table exactly
It extremely complicated system
Nevertheless approach economic interconnection became increasingly important time
To day method every student economics learn heart useful tool institution World Bank United Nations
Much Leontief work devoted question make research useable developing country
In example UN asked expertise
They came asked help report one could help le developed country
They thought I would write nice report put shelf I said
Why need rudder wind get somewhere The study eventually able conduct titled The future world economy proposed alternative path future development
For example Leontief showed industrialized country could reduce production arm use resource saved helping developing country
The basis analysis computation
Though Leontief became known theoretical economist felt strongly theory simply instrument approach reality many fellow economist pay enough attention collection data
Unfortunately pointed instead collecting data make assumption
Instead looking figure say let assume
Then course get something relation reality
Leontief accused academic making gymnastics instead advancing knowledge
He never shy express even served president American Economic Association early
As delivered speech titled Theoretical assumption fact
He cared deeply making quantitative data accessible looking big picture detail exactly tried
Financial Times columnist Tim Harford explains Leontief even called intellectual ancestor developed Lawrence Page
After Page tried map way webpage interconnected similar mathematical technique Leontief used decade map interconnection industry
The major difference Leontief calculated first table American economy used calculator
Eventually first computer came simplified whole process
At Harvard Leontief would use one earliest computer describe US economy alongside different economic sector
Today technological progress allows whole new dimension analysis course
Did Leontief ever chance use Google
Harford smile
I say
While mathematical genius Leontief also enjoyed art music traveling reading
He political person life caring le fortunate hoping relationship Russia United States would improve

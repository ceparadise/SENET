A material whose constituent arranged highly ordered microscopic structure forming extends direction
In addition macroscopic usually identifiable geometrical shape consisting flat specific characteristic orientation
The scientific study crystal crystal formation known
The process crystal formation via mechanism called
The word derives word meaning icy cold frost
Examples large crystal include
Most inorganic solid crystal
many microscopic crystal fused together single solid
Examples polycrystals include rock
A third category solid atom periodic structure whatsoever
Examples amorphous solid include many
Crystals often used practice along sometimes associated belief related religious movement
The scientific definition crystal based microscopic arrangement atom inside called
A crystal solid atom form periodic arrangement
exception see
Not solid crystal
For example liquid water start freezing phase change begin small ice crystal grow fuse forming structure
In final block ice small crystal called grain true crystal periodic arrangement atom whole polycrystal periodic arrangement atom periodic pattern broken
Most macroscopic solid polycrystalline including almost etc
Solids neither crystalline polycrystalline called also called vitreous noncrystalline
These periodic order even microscopically
There distinct difference crystalline solid amorphous solid notably process forming glass release forming crystal
A crystal structure arrangement atom crystal characterized small imaginary box containing one atom specific spatial arrangement
The unit cell space form crystal
The constrained requirement unit cell stack perfectly gap
There possible crystal symmetry called
These grouped crystal may form cube rectangular box shown right crystal may form hexagon
Crystals commonly recognized shape consisting flat face sharp angle
These shape characteristic crystal scientifically defined microscopic atomic arrangement macroscopic characteristic macroscopic shape often present easy see
crystal obvious flat face
crystal usually crystal one grain polycrystalline solid
The flat face also called crystal oriented specific way relative underlying relatively low
This occurs surface orientation stable others lower
As crystal grows new atom attach easily rougher le stable part surface le easily flat stable surface
Therefore flat surface tend grow larger smoother whole crystal surface consists plane surface
See diagram right
One oldest technique science consists measuring orientation face crystal using infer underlying
A visible external shape
This determined restricts possible facet orientation specific crystal chemistry bonding may favor facet type others condition crystal formed
By volume weight largest concentration crystal Earth part solid
Crystals found rock typically range size fraction millimetre several centimetre across although exceptionally large crystal occasionally found
As world largest known naturally occurring crystal crystal Malakialina ft long ft diameter weighing kg lb
Some crystal formed process giving origin large mass crystalline
The vast majority formed molten magma degree crystallization depends primarily condition solidified
Such rock cooled slowly great pressure completely crystallized many kind poured surface cooled rapidly latter group small amount amorphous matter common
Other crystalline rock metamorphic rock recrystallized
This mean first fragmental rock like never condition entirely solution high temperature pressure condition acted erasing original structure inducing recrystallization solid state
Other rock crystal formed precipitation fluid commonly water form vein
The limestone deposited aqueous solution mostly owing arid climate
form common manifestation crystalline polycrystalline matter Earth
A single single crystal collection crystal
Many living able produce crystal example case case
The group atom often solidify many different way
ability solid exist one crystal form
For example water ordinarily found hexagonal form also exist cubic many form
The different polymorph usually called different
In addition atom may able form noncrystalline
For example water also form SiO form amorphous glass crystal
Likewise substance form crystal also form polycrystals
For pure chemical element polymorphism known
For example two crystalline form noncrystalline form
Polymorphs despite atom may wildly different property
For example diamond among hardest substance known graphite soft used lubricant
similar phenomenon atom exist one form
Crystallization process forming crystalline structure fluid material dissolved fluid
More rarely crystal may directly gas see
Crystallization complex field depending condition single fluid solidify many different possible form
It form perhaps various possible impurity
Or form various possibility size arrangement orientation phase grain
The final form solid determined condition fluid solidified chemistry fluid speed parameter changing
Specific industrial technique produce large single crystal called include
Other le exotic method crystallization may used depending physical property substance including simply
Large single crystal created geological process
For example crystal excess found Naica Mexico
For detail geological crystal formation see
Crystals also formed biological process see
Conversely organism special technique crystallization occurring
An crystal every atom perfect exactly repeating pattern
However reality crystalline material variety place crystal pattern interrupted
The type structure defect may profound effect property material
A example crystallographic defect include empty space atom fit extra atom squeezed fit see figure right
Dislocations especially important help determine
Another common type crystallographic defect meaning wrong type atom present crystal
For example perfect crystal would contain atom real crystal might perhaps contain atom well
These boron impurity change slightly blue
Likewise difference type impurity present crystal
In special type impurity called drastically change crystal electrical property
made possible largely putting different semiconductor dopants different place specific pattern
phenomenon somewhere crystallographic defect
Like grain boundary twin boundary different crystal orientation two side
But unlike grain boundary orientation random related specific way
spread crystal plane orientation
A supposed consist smaller crystalline unit somewhat misaligned respect
In general solid held together various type others
None necessarily crystalline
However general trend follows
almost always polycrystalline though exception like metal
The latter grown synthetically
A piece metal may naturally form single crystal larger piece generally
material usually crystalline polycrystalline
In practice large crystal created solidification fluid crystallization solution
solid sometimes called also common notable example
Weak also help hold together certain crystal crystalline well interlayer bonding
material generally form crystalline region length molecule usually prevent complete sometimes polymer completely amorphous
A consists array atom ordered strictly periodic
They many attribute common ordinary crystal displaying discrete pattern ability form shape smooth flat face
Quasicrystals famous ability show symmetry impossible ordinary periodic crystal see
The redefined term crystal include ordinary periodic crystal quasicrystals solid essentially discrete diagram
Quasicrystals first discovered quite rare practice
Only solid known form quasicrystals compared periodic crystal known
The awarded discovery quasicrystals
Crystals certain special electrical optical mechanical property normally
These property related crystal
lack rotational symmetry atomic arrangement
One property voltage across crystal shrink stretch
Another double image appears looking crystal
Moreover various property crystal including may different different direction crystal
For example crystal consist stack sheet although individual sheet mechanically strong sheet rather loosely bound
Therefore mechanical strength material quite different depending direction stress
Not crystal property
Conversely property quite exclusive crystal
They appear made example
science measuring word atomic arrangement crystal
One widely used crystallography technique
Large number known crystal structure stored

A type ice crystal picture taken distance cm
metal easily form large crystal
An apatite crystal sits front center rhodochroite rhomb purple fluorite cube quartz dusting pyrite cube
like one important type
A specimen consisting chalcopyrite crystal nestled bed clear quartz crystal lustrous pyrite crystal
The crystal cm across

There question quartz crystal special
They revered throughout age symbol beauty health often power
The latter sometimes referred key rise fall mythical civilization Atlantis
More recently quartz crystal associated within New Age circle application holistic health meditation
Let u first explore science behind mystique quartz crystal
There many type natural quartz crystal
The common one amethyst citrine rose smoky clear
Natural quartz composed silicon dioxide molecule
Quartz consisting solely silicon dioxide known clear quartz
The member quartz variation
In addition fundamental silicon dioxide structure also chemical impurity present crystal formed
For example amethyst impurity manganese oxide give typical purple color
A natural crystal definition mean regular arrangement atom
In quartz atom vibrate stable frequency
These characteristic make quartz excellent receptor emitter electromagnetic wave
This quartz commonly used radio watch numerous electronic technology
One interesting characteristic quartz crystal observed electricity applied
The quartz begin vibrate turn cause quartz produce weak electric current
This taken advantage working typical quartz watch
Quartz crystal found alternative bookstore circle
In truth humble quartz crystal major element today technological revolution
The conversion quartz crystal silicon chip transformed world
Quartz made digital age possible
It given u computer mobile phone communication breakthrough
Vast piece information brought together precisely organized way silicon chip computer
One early pioneer silicon chip technology Nobel scientist Marcel Vogel
He made discovery working research scientist IBM shook core belief system scientific peer
Vogel discovered crystal programmed silicon chip computer also programmed thought
A person sitting computer input thought keyboard
This stored computer silicon chip via medium electricity
Vogel reasoned like electricity thought form energy given direction intention
He concluded crystal could also programmed without need electricity using thought clear intention
Vogel designed multitude experiment validate quantum theory
Like groundbreaking alternative scientist mainstream scientific community ostracized
The ability quartz crystal transform energy programmed clear thought pattern used many holistic healer master spiritual teacher assist individual pursuit healthy happy life
Whether psychological actual fact many individual report positive result
Yet might consider magic
Armed concept quantum physic group N N Associates recently completed work take science quartz crystal new level demonstrate efficacy validity using quartz crystal promote

As international Indian student get attracted MS Computer Science degree Mecca technology USA amount curiosity also increase
We wrote post addressing aspect
But many unanswered query
What typical background MS CS applicant
How get Masters program
How life US class
How life completing MS program
How easy get job MS US company
We thought best someone gone Masters experience shed light
We invited Rahul answer guest post
Studying bachelor Mumbai BE Information Technology I always eye MS US
My sister PhD VCU definitely one inspiration behind
But I still sure last year Bachelors Engineering whether I pursue MS outside India
Several reason kept taking clear decision matter financial aspect family aspect fact starting
So I decided work year give time decide
Working software field gave experience working India eventually I realized I better advanced degree
Six month I started working I started prepare gave test couple month later
I prepared GRE using official guide online resource
It difficult come work prepare exam I managed get decent score great score good enough
I however take help application process short listing college
Expense major criterion selecting college
I picked expensive college thinking I might get scholarship based work experience
Out university I applied I got accepts
I get scholarship safe bet college I got admit University Texas Dallas list good college good academic standing cost effective tuition fee proximity big telecom company like Cisco Research Motion Ericsson TI many
The fact Dallas weather adverse also helped decision making
Classes US university different experience back India
Classes informal feel conversation open Professor
Don surprised find majority graduate student either India China Americans sprinkled
Most university Indian Students Association ISA help incoming student everything accommodation helping pick right course
ISA student organization family away home make stay enjoyable
One major advantage MS US opportunity interact student world I got ample opportunity
I made friend different part world also got work project
This gave good understanding different thought process got glimpse culture
Living US gave lot confidence take every single decision getting electricity connection managing expense grocery laundry etc make lot responsible especially done India
Weekends always fun deadline assignment test coming everyone high independence get living
Assignments test usually done night out lab library
Getting internship easier job experience India
I get intern big company like Motorola Research Motion BlackBerry couple local company
This huge deal I got get corporate experience well earn money pay tuition fee
I graduated December great time graduate recession
Most company hiring freeze even difficult foreign student get job would require visa sponsorship future
I volunteer project maintain proper visa status kept hunting job
Finally April I got job startup great learning experience
I worked almost year moved stable company company monopoly Rewards Programming gas industry
I learnt various new technology way eventful journey far
At point career I feel I ready get managerial role would want MBA soon probably start year two
Looking back I feel thing I known I would taken different decision
If get admission reputed expensive college partial scholarship even scholarship I would say go
I know someone coming middle class background taking huge loan seem like good idea point get job repay amount year easily
Getting degree good college matter lot even compensation compared someone graduating average college

When choosing course take tough course teach lot course give good grade add much knowledge
Remember course expensive make worth money
This might difficult u coming Indian education system give importance grade education experience
You might get lower grade make sure get concept right understand importance giving interview big company like Google Microsoft etc

Work least year graduating Bachelors give crucial experience based make future decision
Many people find meant technical field better something else like MBA MIS
Others find like particular branch others decide specialization MS PhD area

MBA v MS Like I mentioned previous point working graduate help making decision
If working year find enjoy working technical field see field next year least go MS
If find like technical field want completely change direction go MBA

While reading book I came across paragraph given In order synchronize operation system small quartz crystal located used
The system clock sends signal regular basis computer component
And another paragraph Many personal computer today system clock run MHz device CPUs synchronized system clock run either system clock speed multiple fraction system clock speed
Can anyone kindly tell The needed synchronize component motherboard mean work clock high never low
And clock speed set longest time signal need propagate circuit board system preventing signal arriving signal ready thus keep everything safe synchronized
The purpose used chip
Because CPU need perform operation per time motherboard CPU clock much higher
And want another oscillator
also would need synchronized CPU take multiplies number either fixed model
The system clock switch zero one million time per second rate
The frequency system clock number cycle happens second normally million per second
The CPU basically brain computer mean without computer
The CPU important element
The CPU clock cycle carry instruction

Crystals make interesting fun science fair project
The type project depends educational level
Here example crystal science idea help launch creativity choosing project
Younger investigator may want make collection crystal work method grouping crystal category
Common crystal include salt sugar snowflake quartz
What crystal find
What similarity difference crystal
What material look like crystal really
Hint Glass ordered internal structure crystal
You build model
You show lattice subunit grow crystal shape taken
Your project involve way might prevent crystal forming
For example think way keep crystal forming
Does temperature ice cream matter
What happens result freezing thawing cycle
What effect different ingredient size number crystal form
Growing crystal fun way explore interest chemistry geology
In addition kit lot type crystal grown common household substance sucrose sodium chloride Epsom salt
Sometimes interesting mix different material see type crystal result
For example salt crystal look different grown vinegar
Can figure
If want good science fair project would better tested aspect growing crystal rather simply growing pretty crystal explaining process
Here idea way turn fun project great science fair research project There error
Please try

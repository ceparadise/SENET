In arithmetic using formulaic representation approximation support range
For reason computation often found system include small large real number require fast processing time
A number general represented approximately fixed number scaled using fixed base base scaling normally two ten sixteen
A number represented exactly following form significand integer base integer greater equal two exponent also integer
For example The term refers fact number commonly computer float placed anywhere relative number
This position indicated exponent component thus representation thought kind
A system used represent fixed number digit number different
expressed unit length
The result number represented uniformly spaced difference two consecutive representable number grows chosen scale
Over year variety representation used computer
However since commonly encountered representation defined Standard
The speed operation commonly measured term important characteristic especially application involve intensive mathematical calculation
A FPU colloquially math coprocessor part computer system specially designed carry operation number
A specifies way encoding number usually string digit
There several mechanism string digit represent number
In common mathematical notation digit string length location indicated placing explicit dot comma
If radix point specified string implicitly represents unstated radix point would end string next least significant digit
In system position string specified radix point
So scheme might use string decimal digit decimal point middle whereby would represent
In given number scaled lie within certain radix point appearing immediately first digit
The scaling factor power ten indicated separately end number
For example orbital period moon second value would represented scientific notation second
representation similar concept scientific notation
Logically number consists To derive value number multiplied raised power equivalent shifting radix point implied position number place equal value right exponent positive left exponent negative
Using familiar notation example number ten decimal digit precision represented significand together exponent
To determine actual value decimal point placed first digit significand result multiplied give
In storing number base need stored since entire range supported number thus inferred
Symbolically final value significand ignoring implied decimal point precision number digit significand base example number exponent
Historically several number base used representing number base two common followed base ten decimal le common variety base sixteen even base three see
A number represented one integer divided another example
The base determines fraction represented instance represented exactly number using binary base represented exactly using decimal base
However represented exactly either binary decimal trivial
The occasion infinite expansion occur depend base described article
The way significand including sign exponent stored computer
The common IEEE format described detail later elsewhere example binary representation significand string
For instance number first bit In binary expansion let u denote position leftmost bit significant bit rightmost bit
The significand stop position shown underlined bit
The next bit position called
It used round approximation nearest number case
This bit example added integer formed leftmost bit yielding When stored memory using IEEE encoding becomes
The significand assumed binary point right leftmost bit
So binary representation π calculated follows precision example position bit significand left starting finishing exponent example
It required significant digit significand number except corresponding exponent would smaller minimum one
This process called
For binary format us digit digit necessarily
Therefore need represented memory allowing format one bit precision
This rule variously called
The representation far common way representing computer approximation real number
However alternative In designed version included arithmetic
In Berlin completed first binary programmable us binary number representation signed exponent significand including one implicit bit sign bit
The reliable completed representation positive negative infinity particular implement defined operation infinity stop undefined operation
Zuse also proposed complete carefully rounded arithmetic includes NaN representation anticipating feature IEEE Standard four decade
In contrast recommended number arguing arithmetic preferable
The first computer hardware Zuse computer designed
In Bell Laboratories introduced Mark V implemented
The binary arithmetic became operational
later sold commercially
The arithmetic actually implemented software one megahertz clock rate speed operation machine initially faster many competing computer
The followed introduced use
For many decade hardware typically optional feature computer said scientific computer SC capability see also XSC
It launch Intel personal computer capability hardware standard feature
The introduced supported two representation The also introduced support representation relation UNIVAC representation
Indeed IBM introduced proprietary mainframe representation still available use modern system
However IBM included binary arithmetic mainframe IBM also added decimal arithmetic
Initially computer used many different representation number
The lack standardization mainframe level ongoing problem early writing maintaining source code manufacturer standard differed word size representation rounding behavior general accuracy operation
compatibility across multiple computing system desperate need standardization early leading creation standard become commonplace
This standard significantly based proposal Intel designing numerical coprocessor Motorola designing around time gave significant input well
In mathematician computer scientist honored primary architect behind proposal aided student Jerome Coonen visiting professor Harold Stone
Among innovation A number consists two component whose range depends exclusively number bit digit representation
Whereas component linearly depend range range linearly depends significant range exponentially range exponent component attache outstandingly wider range number
On typical computer system precision binary number coefficient bit one implied exponent bit one sign bit
Positive number format approximate range range exponent approximately log
The complete range format see
The number normalized number system
There smallest positive normalized number Underflow level UFL leading digit remaining digit significand smallest possible value exponent
There largest number Overflow level OFL value digit significand largest possible value exponent
In addition representable value strictly UFL
Namely well
The standardized computer representation binary number
IEC
This first standard followed almost modern machine
It
IBM mainframe support addition IEEE binary format
The series IEEE version still us Cray format
The standard provides many closely related format differing detail
Five format called others termed three especially widely used computer hardware language Increasing precision floating point representation generally reduces amount accumulated caused intermediate calculation
Less common IEEE format include Any integer absolute value le exactly represented single precision format integer absolute value le exactly represented double precision format
Furthermore wide range power time number represented
These property sometimes used purely integer data get integer platform double precision float integer
The standard specifies special value representation positive negative infinity distinct ordinary positive zero number value
Comparison number defined IEEE standard bit different usual integer comparison
Negative positive zero compare equal every NaN compare unequal every value including
All value except NaN strictly smaller strictly greater
Finite number ordered way value set real number
number typically packed computer datum sign bit exponent field significand mantissa left right
For IEEE binary format basic extended extant hardware implementation apportioned follows While exponent positive negative binary format stored unsigned number fixed bias added
Values field reserved zero value reserved infinity NaNs
The exponent range normalized number single precision double quad
Normalized number exclude subnormal value zero infinity NaNs
In IEEE binary interchange format leading bit normalized significand actually stored computer datum
It called hidden implicit bit
Because single precision format actually significand bit precision double precision format quad
For example shown π rounded bit precision The sum exponent bias exponent represented single precision format If one graph value bit pattern bit pattern considered integer value number assume positive one obtains piecewise linear approximation shifted scaled exponential function base hence actually
Conversely given real number one take representation considers integer one get piecewise linear approximation shifted scaled base logarithm hence actually shown right
This interpretation useful visualizing value number vary representation allow certain efficient approximation operation integer operation bit shift
For example reinterpreting float integer taking negative rather subtracting fixed number due bias implicit reinterpreting float yield reciprocal
Explicitly ignoring significand taking reciprocal taking additive inverse unbiased exponent since exponent reciprocal negative original exponent
Hence actually subtracting exponent twice bias corresponds unbiasing taking negative biasing
For significand near reciprocal approximately linear since derivative first term thus significand well taking negative rather subtracting fixed number handle implicit approximately taking reciprocal
More significantly bit shifting allows one compute square shift left take square root shift right
This lead combined previous technique taking inverse allows computation important graphic processing late
This exploited application volume ramping digital sound processing
Concretely time exponent increment value double hence grows exponentially time significand increment given exponent value increase hence grows linearly slope equal actual unbiased value exponent
This hold even last step given exponent significand overflow exponent implicit number regardless exponent increment exponent Thus graph linear piece significand grows given exponent connecting evenly spaced power two significand linear piece twice slope previous approximately scaled shifted exponential
Each piece take horizontal space twice vertical space last
Because exponent convex value always equal actual shifted scaled exponential curve point significand slightly different shift one closely approximate exponential sometimes overestimating sometimes underestimating
Conversely interpreting number integer give approximate shifted scaled logarithm piece half slope last taking vertical space twice horizontal space
Since logarithm convex approximation always corresponding logarithmic curve different choice scale shift right yield closer approximation
In IEEE standard zero signed meaning exist positive zero negative zero
In positive zero usually printed negative zero
The two value behave equal numerical comparison operation return different result
For instance return negative infinity return positive infinity identity maintained
Other common might treat differently include negative number
As approximation scheme operation involving negative zero occasionally cause confusion
For example IEEE always imply
Subnormal value fill gap value absolute distance adjacent value outside underflow gap
This improvement older practice zero underflow gap underflowing result replaced zero flush zero
Modern hardware usually handle subnormal value well normal value require software emulation subnormal
The infinity represented IEEE datatypes like ordinary value like etc
They error value way though often always depends rounding used replacement value
Upon exception positive negative infinity returned exact result
An infinity also introduced numeral like C INFINITY macro programming language allows syntax
IEEE requires infinity handled reasonable way IEEE specifies special value called Not Number NaN returned result certain invalid operation sqrt
In general NaNs propagated
operation involving NaN result NaN although function would give defined result given value NaNs well
NaN
There two kind NaNs default NaNs optionally NaNs
A signaling NaN arithmetic operation including numerical comparison cause invalid signaled
The representation NaNs specified standard unspecified bit could used encode type source error standard encoding
In theory signaling NaNs could used flag uninitialized variable extend number special value without slowing computation ordinary value although extension common
It common misconception esoteric feature IEEE standard discussed extended format NaN infinity subnormal interest advanced numerical application fact opposite true feature designed give safe robust default numerically unsophisticated programmer addition supporting sophisticated numerical library expert
The key designer IEEE note incorrect deem feature IEEE Standard Binary Arithmetic appreciated feature usable none numerical expert
The fact quite opposite
In feature designed Intel serve widest possible market tell u design arithmetic like IEEE Standard moderately tolerant ignorance among programmer
By nature number expressed format terminating expansion relevant base example terminating decimal expansion terminating binary expansion
Irrational number rational number must approximated
The number digit bit precision also limit set rational number represented exactly
For example number exactly represented eight decimal digit precision available
When number represented format character string native representation supported computer implementation require conversion used implementation
If number represented exactly format conversion exact
If exact representation conversion requires choice number use represent original value
The representation chosen different value original value thus adjusted called
Whether rational number terminating expansion depends base
For example number terminating expansion number
In rational denominator power terminating
Any rational denominator prime factor infinite binary expansion
This mean number appear short exact written decimal format may need approximated converted binary
For example decimal number representable binary finite precision exact binary representation would sequence continuing endlessly previously significand exponent
When rounded bit becomes actually decimal
As example real number represented binary infinite sequence bit approximated precision bit
In binary represented
This decimal value whereas accurate approximation true value π The result rounding differs true value part per million match decimal representation π first digit
The difference limited
The arithmetical difference two consecutive representable number exponent called ULP
For example representable number lying representable number ULP
For number exponent part
number absolute value higher equal lower ULP exactly single precision exactly double precision
The mandated behavior hardware result within ULP
Rounding used exact result operation conversion format would need digit digit significand
IEEE requires rounded result infinitely precise arithmetic used compute value rounded although implementation three extra bit needed ensure
There several different scheme
Historically typical approach
Since introduction IEEE default method sometimes called Banker Rounding commonly used
This method round ideal infinitely precise result arithmetic operation nearest representable value give representation result
In case tie value would make significand end even digit chosen
The IEEE standard requires rounding applied fundamental algebraic operation including square root conversion numeric result
It mean result IEEE operation completely determined bit result except representation NaNs
Library function cosine log mandated
Alternative rounding option also available
IEEE specifies following rounding mode Alternative mode useful amount error introduced must bounded
Applications require bounded error
The alternative rounding mode also useful diagnosing numerical instability result subroutine vary substantially rounding infinity likely numerically unstable affected error
For ease presentation understanding decimal digit precision used example IEEE format
The fundamental principle precision except normalization optional affect numerical value result
Here denotes significand denotes exponent
A simple method add number first represent exponent
In example second number shifted right three digit one proceeds usual addition method In detail This true result exact sum operand
It rounded seven digit normalized necessary
The final result Note lowest three digit second operand essentially lost
This
In extreme case sum two number may equal one In conceptual example would appear large number extra digit would need provided adder ensure correct rounding however binary addition subtraction using careful implementation technique two extra bit one extra bit need carried beyond precision operand
Another problem loss significance occurs two nearly equal number subtracted
In following example representation rational
The best representation difference differs
In extreme case significant digit precision lost although gradual underflow ensures result zero unless two operand equal
This illustrates danger assuming digit computed result meaningful
Dealing consequence error topic see also
To multiply significands multiplied exponent added result rounded normalized
Similarly division accomplished subtracting divisor exponent dividend exponent dividing dividend significand divisor significand
There cancellation absorption problem multiplication division though small error may accumulate operation performed succession
In practice way operation carried digital logic quite complex see
For fast simple method see
computation computer run three kind problem Prior IEEE standard condition usually caused program terminate triggered kind programmer might able catch
How worked meaning program
Note term exception used IEEE general term meaning exceptional condition necessarily error different usage typically defined programming language Java alternative flow control closer termed trap IEEE terminology
Here required default method handling exception according IEEE discussed IEEE optional trapping alternate exception handling mode discussed
Arithmetic exception default required recorded sticky status flag bit
That sticky mean reset next arithmetic operation stay set explicitly reset
The use sticky flag thus allows testing exceptional condition delayed full expression subroutine without exceptional condition could otherwise ignored would require explicit testing immediately every operation
By default operation always return result according specification without interrupting computation
For instance return also setting flag bit default designed often return finite result used subsequent operation safely ignored
The original IEEE standard however failed recommend operation handle set arithmetic exception flag bit
So implemented hardware initially programming language implementation typically provide mean access apart assembler
Over time programming language standard Fortran updated specify method access change status flag bit
The version IEEE standard specifies operation accessing handling arithmetic flag bit
The programming model based single thread execution use multiple thread handled outside standard
specifies flag
IEEE specifies five arithmetic exception recorded status flag sticky bit The default return value exception designed give correct result majority case exception ignored majority code
return correctly rounded result return denormalized small value almost always ignored
return infinity exactly typically divide finite number give zero else give exception subsequently also typically ignored
For example effective resistance n resistor parallel see fig
given
If develops set return give final expected see continued fraction example another example
exception typically ignored necessarily represent error example routine part normal operation may evaluate function value outside domain returning NaN exception flag ignored finding useful start point
The fact number precisely represent real number operation precisely represent true arithmetic operation lead many surprising situation
This related finite computer generally represent number
For example binary mean result attempting square neither representable number closest
In single precision representation decimal given previously Squaring number give Squaring hardware rounding give But representable number closest Also π mean attempted computation tan yield result infinity even overflow
It simply possible standard hardware attempt compute tan represented exactly
This computation C give result
In single precision using tanf function result
By token attempted computation sin π yield zero
The result approximately double precision single precision
While addition multiplication necessarily
That necessarily equal
Using significand decimal arithmetic They also necessarily
That may In addition loss significance inability represent number π exactly slight inaccuracy following phenomenon may occur quantity characterizes accuracy system used algorithm
It also known unit roundoff
Usually denoted Ε value depends particular rounding used
With rounding zero whereas rounding nearest This important since bound representing real number x within normalized range system Backward error analysis theory developed popularized used establish algorithm implementing numerical function numerically stable
The basic approach show although calculated result due roundoff error exactly correct exact solution nearby problem slightly perturbed input data
If perturbation required small order uncertainty input data result sense accurate data deserves
The algorithm defined
Stability measure sensitivity rounding error given numerical procedure contrast function given problem indicates inherent sensitivity function small perturbation input independent implementation used solve problem
As trivial example consider simple expression giving inner product length two vector sum two slightly perturbed order Ε input data backward stable
For realistic example see Higham reference
Although noted previously individual arithmetic operation IEEE guaranteed accurate within half ULP complicated formula suffer larger error due
The loss accuracy substantial problem data meaning correct result hypersensitive tiny perturbation data
However even function suffer large loss accuracy algorithm data used apparently equivalent formulation expression programming language differ markedly numerical stability
One approach remove risk loss accuracy design analysis numerically stable algorithm aim branch mathematics known
Another approach protect risk numerical instability computation intermediate scratch value algorithm higher precision final result requires remove reduce order magnitude risk designed purpose computing double precision
For example following algorithm direct implementation compute function A x exp however shown numerically unstable lose half significant digit carried arithmetic computed near
If however intermediate computation performed extended precision
setting line long double full precision final double result maintained
Alternatively numerical analysis algorithm reveals following change line made algorithm becomes numerically stable compute full double precision
To maintain property carefully constructed numerically stable program careful handling required
Certain optimization compiler might make example reordering operation work goal software
There controversy failing compiler language design area example language optimization carefully specified maintain numerical precision

Brief description several additional issue technique follow
As decimal fraction often exactly represented binary arithmetic best simply used measure quantity wide range scale orbital period moon around Saturn mass worst expected model interaction quantity expressed decimal string expected exact
An example latter case financial calculation
For reason financial software tends use binary number representation
The decimal data type programming language decimal format standard designed avoid problem binary representation applied exact decimal value make arithmetic always behave expected number printed decimal
Expectations mathematics may realized field computation
For example known however fact relied quantity involved result computation
The use equality test requires care dealing number
Even simple expression like computer fail true IEEE double precision example approximately equal
Consequently test sometimes replaced fuzzy comparison epsilon sufficiently small tailored application
The wisdom varies greatly require numerical analysis bound epsilon
Values derived primary data representation comparison performed wider extended precision minimize risk inconsistency due error
It often better organize code way test unnecessary
For example exact test whether point lie line plane defined point performed using adaptive precision exact arithmetic method
Small error arithmetic grow mathematical algorithm perform operation enormous number time
A example computation differential equation solving
These algorithm must carefully designed using numerical approach work well
Summation vector value basic algorithm awareness loss significance occur essential
For example one adding large number number individual addend small compared sum
This lead loss significance
A typical addition would something like The low digit addend effectively lost
Suppose example one need add many number approximately equal
After added running sum lost digit regained
The may used reduce error
error affect convergence accuracy iterative numerical procedure
As example approximated π calculating perimeter polygon inscribing circumscribing circle starting hexagon successively doubling number side
As noted computation may rearranged way mathematically equivalent le prone error
Two form recurrence formula circumscribed polygon Here computation using IEEE double significand bit precision arithmetic While two form recurrence formula clearly mathematically equivalent first subtracts number extremely close leading increasingly problematic loss
As recurrence applied repeatedly accuracy improves first deteriorates
It never get better digit even though arithmetic capable digit precision
When second form recurrence used value converges digit precision

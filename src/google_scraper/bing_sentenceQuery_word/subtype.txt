In Greek many much form shape provision single entity different
A one whose operation also applied value type type
There several fundamentally different kind polymorphism The interaction parametric polymorphism subtyping lead concept
Ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism originally described set lecture note written British computer scientist
In paper introduced term model subtypes
However implementation subtyping inheritance predate term inclusion polymorphism appeared chose term refer polymorphic function applied argument different type behave differently depending type argument applied also known
The term context intended pejorative refers simply fact type polymorphism fundamental feature type system
In example function seem work generically various type looking invocation considered two entirely distinct function compiler intent purpose In language situation complex correct function need invoked might determinable run time
Implicit type conversion also defined form polymorphism referred coercion polymorphism
allows function data type written generically handle value without depending type
Parametric polymorphism way make language expressive still maintaining full static
The concept parametric polymorphism applies
A function evaluate applied value different type known A data type appear generalized type
element arbitrary type designated like generalized type specialization made
Parametric polymorphism ubiquitous functional programming often simply referred polymorphism
The following example show parametrized list data type two parametrically polymorphic function Parametric polymorphism also available several language
For instance D name C Java later formally developed notion polymorphism extension lambda calculus called polymorphic lambda calculus
Any parametrically polymorphic function necessarily restricted working shape data instead value leading concept
Some language employ idea also called restrict range type used particular case polymorphism
In language subtyping allows function written take object certain type also work correctly passed object belongs type subtype according
This type relation sometimes written
Conversely said
Subtype polymorphism usually resolved dynamically see
In following example make cat dog subtypes animal
The procedure accepts animal also work correctly subtype passed In another example type function written take work equally well passed passed
The actual type object hidden client accessed via object
In fact type may even possible get hand object whose type see
This particular kind type hierarchy context usually contains many type
offer subtype polymorphism using also known
In typical implementation class contains called table function implement polymorphic part class object contains pointer vtable class consulted whenever polymorphic method called
This mechanism example The go popular object system
Some however provide method call polymorphic argument
Row Polymorphism similar distinct concept subtyping
It deal
It allows usage value whose type certain property without losing remaining type information
A related concept
A polytypic function general polymorphic function though one provide fixed ad hoc case specific data type ad hoc combinator absent
Polymorphism distinguished implementation selected statically compile time dynamically run time typically via
This known respectively corresponding form polymorphism accordingly called
Static polymorphism executes faster dynamic dispatch overhead requires additional compiler support
Further static polymorphism allows greater static analysis compiler notably optimization source code analysis tool human reader programmer
Dynamic polymorphism flexible example dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing dynamically linked library may operate object without knowing full type
Static polymorphism typically occurs ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism whereas dynamic polymorphism usual subtype polymorphism
However possible achieve static polymorphism subtyping sophisticated use namely

polymorphism obtained function work appears work several different type may exhibit common structure may behave unrelated way type
Strachey Subtype polymorphism seems fit description albeit usually late binding type dictate function behavior
In Java example function work object many wholly distinct implementation distinguished one another based runtime type object class override create new ad hoc definition
But I poke around online I usually find people making sharp distinction subtype polymorphism ad hoc polymorphism treated wholly different beast
Would correct say subtype polymorphism kind ad hoc polymorphism
If
They definitely different thing easier see clearer definition polymorphism
Quoting ad hoc polymorphism kind polymorphism polymorphic function applied argument different type
So definition quoted using mean passed argument rather called
polymorphism available Java form method overloading
For example method taking different set parameter
Other language obvious example polymorphism one list parameter programmer decide inside
Subtype polymorphism however treat instance one type instance another type anything available second type also avaialable first
This example give
operate different argument called different type defined everything Java subtype
Keep mind PL lingo term polymorphism used different notion
In OOP polymorphism usually mean subtype polymorphism
If function call object subtype
In way function defined operate many type justifies usage word polymorphism
In functional programming often subtypes
Still function universally quantified type
This function take two argument type chosen caller return value type
Hence called polymorphic function
In OOP language similar feature found name generic function
Java
We call also feature parametric polymorphism
There terminology mismatch since OOP decided use polymorphism term refer subtyping one hence needed new term parametric polymorphism
Anyway parametric polymorphism value unknown quantified type concretely used since know merely passed around
This projection first argument function way produce return value type except reuse first argument
Similarly must identity function
In language sometimes parametric polymorphism broken specific construct language
Minor offender When present one still obtains weaker form parametric polymorphism
Worse offender Indeed consider code This identity function type except something arbitrarily different
The function ugly handle argument argument unknown type
It actually check type make decision
We longer parametric polymorphism since type handled uniform way special
What get instead function act type still polymorphic completely unrelated behavior
In sense unconstrained family function indexed type A
This call ad hoc polymorphism

I think type range value variable take whereas rest known constant matter
Variables instance object share common property considered belong
That type property constant across type
The type actually common property class object variable
The variable variable part may change making flipping one subtype
However applies subtypes subtypes also share common constant property
I may describe class circle Vienn Diagramm
Its subspheres would type variable
I think variable mean fixed part type variable part make variable constant
The constant value would elementary point diagramm
For instance integer subtype real
Integer variable mean take concrete value within range integer area
Similarly boolean variable taking value subtype integer
But constant
Is real integer boolean variable specific type instance common property value
Is known treatment
My interest stem practice I save memory fixing common part variable language processing framework
This seems confused
Probably state programming language referring concept may different definition depending language formalism
Much arbitrary possibly always consistent
For example necessarily booleans subtype integer
One important issue distinguish syntax write talk entity semantics actual entity wish talk
In simple world type may understood set value language manipulate specific representation
A constant representation specific value
In many language constant name given specific value given context
A variable place holder value may change
Now interpreted bit differently depending type programming langusge notably imperative functional kind
Things get complicated start aggregating value various way language let consider aggregate component may change
You probably go back textbook programming language
I agree considering type set value simplistic
But I trying make simple answer I
This precisely considering subtype may always good idea may simple may seem

In also form related another datatype notion meaning program element typically function written operate element supertype also operate element subtype
If S subtype T subtyping often written S T mean term type S term type T expected
The precise semantics subtyping crucially depends particular safely used context mean given
The programming language essentially defines subtyping relation may well
Due subtyping relation term may belong one type
Subtyping therefore form type polymorphism
In term commonly used refer solely technique would considered
often allow subtyping
Consequently extended record type perhaps simplest theoretical setting useful notion subtyping may defined studied
Because resulting calculus allows term one type longer simple
Since functional programming language definition support also stored record record type subtyping provide feature programming
Typically functional programming language also provide usually restricted form parametric polymorphism
In theoretical setting desirable study interaction two feature common theoretical setting
Various calculus attempt capture theoretical property programming may derived system F
The concept subtyping related linguistic notion
It also related concept mathematical logic
Subtyping confused notion class object language subtyping relation type interface parlance whereas inheritance relation implementation stemming language feature allows new object created existing one
In number language subtyping called inheritance referred
The notion subtyping programming language date back introduced derivative
The first formal treatment subtyping given used formalize
The concept subtyping gained visibility synonymy polymorphism circle mainstream adoption programming
In context principle safe substitution often called popularized address conference programming
Because must consider mutable object ideal notion subtyping defined Liskov called considerably stronger implemented
See detail
A simple practical example subtypes shown diagram right
The type bird three subtypes duck cuckoo ostrich
Conceptually variety basic bird inherits many bird characteristic specific difference
The notation used diagram arrow showing direction type relationship supertype subtypes
As practical example language might allow integer value used wherever floating point value expected might define generic type common supertype integer real
In second case subtypes
Programmers may take advantage subtyping would possible without
Consider following example If integer real subtypes operator comparison arbitrary Number defined type value either type passed function
However possibility implementing operator highly constrains Number type example one ca compare integer complex number actually comparing integer integer real real make sense
Rewriting function would accept type requires
Subtyping type theory characterized fact expression type may also given type formal codifies known rule
Type theorist make distinction type declared certain way may subtypes structure two type determines whether one subtype
The subtyping described nominal structural subtyping rule language might say object type handle message object type handle define subtype regardless whether either
This common dynamically typed language
Sound structural subtyping rule type object type also well known
Implementations programming language subtyping fall two general class implementation representation value type also represents value type implementation value type one type
The subtyping induced subclassing language usually inclusive subtyping relation relate integer number represented differently usually coercive
In almost type system define subtyping relation reflexive meaning type transitive meaning
This make type
Types give rise concept subtyping
These express two different way obtaining new type record allows operation original record type
Recall record collection named field
Since subtype type allows operation allowed original type record subtype support operation field original type supported
One kind way achieve support called add field record
More formally every named field appearing width supertype appear width subtype
Thus operation feasible supertype supported subtype
The second method called replaces various field subtypes
That field subtype subtypes field supertype
Since operation supported field supertype supported subtype operation feasible record supertype supported record subtype
Depth subtyping make sense immutable record example assign field real point record two real field ca field integer point however deep subtype real point type integer see
Subtyping record defined combine subtyping record type theoretical basis many support feature
Some system also support subtyping labeled type
The rule width subtyping reversed every tag appearing width subtype must appear width supertype
If function type subtype function property
The argument type said subtyping relation reversed whereas return type
Informally reversal occurs refined type liberal type accepts conservative type return
This exactly work function internally class inherits seen general language parameter type return type type mean type contravariant mean covariant
In language allow side effect like language subtyping generally sufficient guarantee function safely used context another
Liskov work area focused besides type system safety discussed article also requires subtypes preserve guaranteed supertypes
This definition subtyping generally verified
The subtyping similar treatment function argument return value
reference contravariant like function argument reference covariant like return value
Mutable reference act source sink invariant
In coercive subtyping system subtypes defined implicit function subtype supertype
For subtyping relationship coercion function provided object type regarded object type
A coercion function may defined composition may regarded object type compound coercion
The type Coercion function record subtypes may defined componentwise case record type coercion simply discard component defined supertype
The type coercion function type may given reflecting function argument covariance return value
The coercion function uniquely determined given subtype
Thus multiple subtyping relationship defined one must careful guarantee type coercion coherent
For instance integer coerced floating point number say admissible coerce compound coercion given would distinct identity coercion

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

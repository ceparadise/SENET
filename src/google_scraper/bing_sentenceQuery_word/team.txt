Microsoft research lab around world computer scientist programmer engineer expert trying crack computer industry toughest problem system design security quantum computing data visualization
A subset scientist engineer programmer different goal They trying use computer science solve one complex deadly challenge human face Cancer
And part algorithm computer instead test tube beaker
We trying change way research done daily basis biology said biologist training work group Microsoft Cambridge lab
One team researcher using machine learning natural language processing help world leading oncologist figure effective individualized cancer treatment patient providing intuitive way sort research data available
Another pairing machine learning computer vision give radiologist detailed understanding patient tumor progressing
Yet another group researcher created powerful algorithm help scientist understand cancer develop treatment work best fight
And another team working moonshot effort could one day allow scientist program cell fight disease including cancer
Although individual project vary widely Microsoft overarching philosophy toward solving cancer focus two basic approach said Jeannette Wing Microsoft corporate vice president charge company basic research lab
One approach rooted idea cancer biological process information processing system
Using approach tool used model reason computational process programming language compiler model checker used model reason biological process
The approach
It based idea researcher apply technique machine learning plethora biological data suddenly become available use sophisticated analysis tool better understand treat cancer
Both approach share common ground including core philosophy success depends biologist computer scientist bringing expertise problem
The collaboration biologist computer scientist actually key making work Wing said
Wing said Microsoft good reason make broad bold investment using computer science tackle cancer
For one keeping company core mission
If talk empowering every person organization achieve step one journey said
Beyond said Microsoft extensive investment cloud computing natural fit field need plenty computing power solve big problem
Longer term said make sense Microsoft invest way provide tool customer matter computing platform choose even one day platform living cell
If computer future going made silicon might made living matter behooves u make sure understand mean program computer said
The research team effort also come amid major breakthrough understanding role genetics play getting treating cancer
That turn spurring even stronger focus treating cancer case personalized way sometimes called precision medicine
We revolution respect cancer treatment said distinguished scientist senior director genomics group Microsoft
Even year ago people thought treat tissue You brain cancer get brain cancer treatment
You lung cancer get lung cancer treatment
Now know important treat genomics cancer
gene gone bad That research helped along recent advance ability easily affordably map human genome genetic material
That giving scientist wealth information understanding cancer developing personalized effective treatment sheer amount data also present plenty challenge
We reached point drowning information
We measure much Fisher said
How take information turn knowledge
That different story
There huge leap information data knowledge Researchers say area computer scientist best help biological science
Some promising approach involve using branch artificial intelligence called machine learning automatically legwork make precision medicine unwieldy
In basic scenario machine learning system thing like identify cat photo based previous picture cat seen
In field cancer research technique deployed sort organize million piece research medical data
These fortes artificial intelligence machine learning said researcher Microsoft Redmond Washington lab using technique called machine reading help oncologist find latest information effective cancer treatment individual patient
Another big advantage cloud computing
Using tool like researcher able provide biologist kind approach even medical expert powerful computer hosting tool cloud anyone access internet
Microsoft researcher say company also lead computing cancer effort long history software company providing platform people build expand
If look combination thing Microsoft really well make perfect sense Microsoft industry said head group Microsoft Cambridge lab
In field specifically Phillips said researcher benefit Microsoft history software innovator
We use method developed programming computer program biology unlock even application even better treatment said
Of course none tool help fight cancer save life unless accessible understandable biologist oncologist cancer researcher
Microsoft researcher say taken great pain make system easy use even people without background particular interest technology computer science
That includes everything learning speak language doctor biologist designing tool mimic system people use lab
We always talking building tool help doctor said senior researcher specializes programming language machine learning working system ass tumor change
Jasmin Fisher Senior researcher Degree life science master biophysics physiology neuroimmunology Weizmann Institute Science Israel
By time I nearing end amid buzz excitement newly emerging interest system biology I became intrigued potential computational method investigating complex dynamic biological system
My goal still develop technology change way research particular advance cancer research
I think best place foundational work environment like Microsoft Research
asmin Fisher want cure cancer
She want solve belief possible lifetime
I saying cancer cease exist said senior researcher Microsoft Cambridge research lab associate professor biochemistry department Cambridge University
But manage know control solved To Fisher team believe need use technology understand cancer specifically biological process cause cell turn cancerous
Then understand problem occurred need figure fix
Fisher take computational approach cancer research
She think like computer scientist think computer program
Her goal understand program set instruction cause cell execute command behave certain way
Once build computer program describes healthy behavior cell compare diseased cell figure way unhealthy behavior fixed
If figure build program debug solved problem said
That sound simple enough course actually getting quite complicated
One approach Fisher team taking called BMA short
It tool allows biologist model cell interact communicate connection make
The system creates computerized model compare biological process healthy cell abnormal process occur disease strike
That turn could allow scientist see interaction million gene protein human body lead cancer quickly devise best least harmful way provide personalized treatment patient
I use BMA understand cancer understand process becoming cancer understand communication going said Royal Society University Research Fellow Cambridge work Fisher project
Hall said BMA many us including figuring detect cancer earlier understanding better treat cancer modeling medicine effective point cancer might become resistant
Here one way BMA might work Let say patient rare often fatal form brain cancer
Using BMA clinician could enter biological information patient system
Then could use system run sort experiment comparing cancer patient information healthy patient example simulating patient system might respond various medication
That kind computation would impossible person using pen paper even simpler computer program many variable within million molecule protein gene working together human body
To create kind solution Fisher envisions need powerful computational model capable building immensely complex model running possible solution abnormality
The ability run type experiment silico using computer instead pen paper test tube beaker also allows researcher quickly test many possibility
That turn giving better understanding cancer develop evolve interact rest body
I think accelerate research able test many possibility possibly could laboratory said principal scientist pharmaceutical company Fisher team
In past Dry said sheer difficulty testing hypothesis meant researcher focus favorite one making educated guess might promising
A system BMA allows try sort idea make likely hit correct one le likely miss dark horse candidate
If go experimentally test hypothesis would nigh impossible Dry said
These model give u sense really Microsoft AstraZeneca using BMA better understand drug interaction resistance patient certain type leukemia
With BMA two research team able better understand various patient responded differently certain treatment
Dry said BMA hold huge promise personalized approach cancer treatment precision medicine
The researcher hoping system like BMA could eventually allow researcher oncologist look detail person cancer case also run test consider factor could impact treatment whether patient another illness taking medication might interact cancer drug
It really recognizes every patient individual vast heterogeneity Dry said
Fisher belief system BMA possibility revolutionize cancer understood success possible biologist feel comfortable using
designer worked extensively BMA said system built familiar understandable biologist possible
Benque worked year create tool visually mimic scientist might use lab using language biologist could understand
Fisher said imperative system like biologist Otherwise said breakthrough needed solve cancer happen
Everyone realizes need computing cancer research
It one thing understand another thing convince clinician actually use tool said
f developer creating new piece software chance write code computer scientist like call principled way using programming language formal process create system follows computing rule
want thing biology
He part team trying computing cell instead silicon
Andrew Phillips Head Bio Computation Group Degree computer electronic engineering National Institute Applied Sciences Toulouse France degree computer science University Cambridge computer science Imperial College London
I realized challenge reasoning programming biological system mirrored reasoning programming complex concurrent distributed computer system
Microsoft Research premier computer science research institution world
The method develop potential profoundly impact ability understand biological system work also program
If computing biological system transfer learned traditional computing medical biotechnology application said Dalchau scientist biological computation research group Microsoft Cambridge lab
The ultimate goal computational approach program biology like program computer
That breakthrough would open sort possibility everything treating disease feeding world efficient crop
All aspect daily life affected said head Biological Computation Research Group
Phillips said one approach create kind molecular computer would put inside cell monitor disease
If sensor detected disease would actuate response fight
That stark improvement many current cancer treatment end destroying healthy cell process fighting cancerous one
Phillips caution computer scientist still early stage research kind goal remain far
It ultimate application said
One big obvious challenge biological system including body much mysterious hardware computer created run software
We built computer
We know work
We build cell many complex internal working remain mystery u
So need understand cell computes order program Phillips said
We need develop method software analyzing programming Take cancer example
scientist also working biological computation group said think cancer biological program gone wrong healthy cell bug caused glitch
And token noted think immune system machinery ability fix bug
Scientists learned much cause cancer activates immune system Dunn said still early day still much work done
If team get point understand system well understand make Microsoft Word run PC might able equip immune system mount powerful response cancer
If want able program biology actually need able understand biology computes first place said
That I think major Is ability program biology like program computer moonshot effort
Phillips belief ambitious goal see path success
Like moonshot know technically possible said
Now matter making worldwide diagnosed cancer year
For select expert leading cancer institution gather called molecular tumor board review patient individual history come best personalized treatment plan based cancer diagnosis genetic makeup
want democratize molecular tumor board working team researcher tool
It called Project Hanover
It approach us branch artificial intelligence called machine learning automatically legwork make difficult cancer expert evaluate every case individually
We understand cancer often caused single mutation
Instead stem complex interaction lot different mutation mean need pretty much look everything know genome Poon said
To require sifting million piece fragmented information find common ground applicable one person one cancer case
For busy oncologist managing many patient simply possible
That Microsoft researcher working system could augment doctor approach task today
The system designed automatically sort fragmented information find relevant piece data leaving tumor expert time use expertise figure best treatment plan patient
The ultimate goal help doctor research present Microsoft Azure cloud tool let doctor model treatment would work best based information gathered
If use knowledge base present research result relevant specific patient regular oncologist take look make best decision said Ravi Pandya principal software architect Microsoft also working Project Hanover
Project Hanover began tool called cloud system sort million research paper look genomic research might applicable individual disease diagnosis
That task would hard oncologist sheer volume made complicated fact researcher always consistent describe work
That mean several research paper focusing genetic information may much overlap language
The problem people creative figuring different way say thing Poon said
To build Literome Poon colleague used machine learning develop natural language processing tool require small amount available knowledge create sophisticated model finding different description similar knowledge
Hoifung Poon Researcher Degree computer science Sun University China department computer science engineering University Washington United States
In college I became fascinated biology reading book evolution
More recently advent genomics big data herald promise precision medicine put computer science front center combatting fundamental challenge ensue knowledge reasoning
As computer scientist I find temptation impossible resist
Microsoft offer unparalleled environment academic freedom wonderful mix mutually inspiring colleague complementary skill set leadership supporting Pasteur quadrant fundamental research potential high impact practice
Microsoft strength cloud computing enterprise engagement also conducive enacting progress helping million patient
Now tool expanded also look experiment source information might helpful
Poon team also working Oregon Health Science University help researcher find better way fight complex often deadly form cancer called acute myeloid leukemia
director Knight Cancer Institute said person form cancer may actually fighting three four type leukemia
That made extremely difficult figure right medicine use whether patient develop resistance treatment
It clear needed incredibly sophisticated computational effort try digest data generating try make sense said Druker whose previous research led vastly improved life expectancy patient chronic myeloid leukemia
Druker think kind collaboration dialogue His team expert provide hypothesis help computer scientist know look data
The computer scientist turn analysis needed help prove disprove hypothesis
That help quickly develop needed treatment therapy
I always believed data trying tell u answer need know listen said
That computation come Druker belief beginning understanding data help inform cancer research
In addition genomic data said researcher also start looking call omics including proteomics study protein metabolomics study chemical process involving metabolite
We going get beyond genome said
The genome telling u lot telling u Poon said still early stage research already see could change save life
We tantalizing moment caught glimpse really promising future much work done said
hen radiologist want get best accurate picture going inside patient body often turn equipment cost million dollar churn highly detailed image
And get image
In many case thing use read human eye
Eyeballing work well diagnosing said machine learning computer vision expert head radiomics research Microsoft Cambridge lab
Expert radiologist look image say scan someone brain able say two second Yes tumor
No Antonio Criminisi Principal researcher Degree electronics engineering University Palermo Italy computer vision University Oxford
Since I first became interested computer vision I always thought best application would automatic analysis medical image sort
Microsoft allowed develop underlying basic research enables u create truly innovative healthcare product
But come figuring treatment working Criminisi said radiologist job get much difficult
That human eye good easily measuring complex way modern radiology scan show whether tumor may growing shrinking changing shape
A year ago radiologist president Royal College Radiologists said typical CT scan might produced image
Now scan might produce image producing wealth data may even perceptible human eye
The fine detail far exceeds ability understand actually process something meaningful Maskell said
Put simply radiologist need technology help keep technology
We need help actually present data u way make easy u analyze huge number image Maskell said
That Criminisi team come
The team approach focused research project aim use computer vision machine learning augment radiologist expertise giving detailed consistent measurement
The system researcher working could eventually evaluate scan pixel pixel tell radiologist exactly much tumor grown shrunk changed shape since last scan
It also could provide information thing like tissue density give radiologist better sense whether something likely cyst tumor
And could provide analysis health cell surrounding tumor
Doing eye pretty much impossible Criminisi said
The goal replace radiologist expertise rather allow job better
There always going need human interpretation Maskell said
The computer computer science allow u make better Allison Linn senior writer Microsoft

Categories Subject Descriptors Computer Information Science Education Academia computing technology changing rapidly
Public support university traditional balance research teaching come increased scrutiny criticism
At time modern society grows ever dependent computing technology many sector science industry anticipate ongoing shortage computer scientist engineer
The distance foundation computing research application frontier considerably shorter many field
As result curriculum computer science engineering CS E face constant evolutionary pressure integrate new critical development
The rapid change technology however also affect process educational delivery
Recent advance networking graphic example make possible develop effective pedagogical tool shared among many different educational institution
CS E educator must play key role responding change
To remain effective CS E education must evolve method content discipline progress
Educators need champion new technology increase quality education provide opportunity wider class student prepare graduate participate development technology ensure safety privacy empowerment competency future citizen
Meeting challenge require fundamental change way faculty represent principle practice CS E educational level
Education computer science engineering active area throughout much history discipline
Particularly since establishment first computer science department mid considerable attention paid challenge training student rapidly evolving field
In ACM published extensive report computer science curriculum entitled
That report subsequently updated two report issued approximately interval
The IEEE Computer Society published independent curriculum computer science engineering subsequently collaborated ACM report
In addition various organization issued several additional report covering issue computer science liberal art college structure introductory course standard accreditation secondary school curriculum
Each year since ACM Special Interest Group Computer Science Education SIGCSE held symposium attracts increasingly larger audience year
Computer science education also proved lively topic discussion well computing forum
One important strength computer science education community willingness experiment diverse model education
This diversity easily recognized design introductory curriculum successful course designed using following model addition traditional one emphasizes problem solving programming Experimentation development occurs level curriculum well
The Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon University example developed entire undergraduate curriculum software engineering
Faculty many institution also created program serve model computer science education school
Overall continuing importance education strategic area computer science engineering CS E research reaffirmed report appearance distinct subject area SDCR Workshop
The topic education computer science engineering large consider
To make topic manageable working group chose distinguish following five area These area considered individually following subsection
Computer science remains rapidly evolving discipline place considerable pressure CS E curriculum
The emergence new tool technique paradigm force continual reevaluation topic covered pedagogical approach used
Maintaining curriculum particularly difficult institution pace change discipline fast
As result CS E curriculum quickly becomes outdated technology advance
One indication obsolescence curriculum fact many important topic yet find niche core curriculum offered many institution
Examples topic include paradigm problem solving parallelism network interaction software design software safety social impact technology
One way address lack attention paid issue would update knowledge unit incorporate contemporary core topic theme eliminating concept become outdated
Given curriculum report traditionally published every decade critical establish responsive process would allow integration new principle artifact soon emerge
A similar process continually identifying eliminating obsolescent topic core curriculum also needed
Because rapid pace change discipline imperative computer science institution develop better mechanism sharing educational resource
There far much reinvention little synergy throughout educational community
For example proliferation text waste time creates many result
We need develop new mechanism successful course material widely economically shared
As possible starting point SIGCSE Web page NSF Computer Science Courseware repository contain link information variety course material available different institution
Some recent textbook similarly advised instructor download supporting software laboratory material use course
Although Web provides underlying technology sharing resource system would effective without level centralized support
If institution simply publishes material independently easy way others find right material vastness Web assurance quality
To create effective repository someone likely group agency must take role reviewer filter material manageable collection ensure quality maintained
Different institution different educational priority constituency must therefore shape program accordingly
Some driven industry need others driven general goal liberal art science education
Because difference common model applies institution
Despite difference nonetheless several problem affect wide range institution offering undergraduate program computer science
These problem identified following paragraph
The relationship education research must reexamined college university faculty well entire profession
New interaction research education industry needed student faculty computing practitioner maximize utility education throughout broad range intellectual practical interest serf
Standards promotion tenure must change make teaching exciting activity faculty alongside research consulting
To end institution must find way recognize value faculty effort toward pedagogical curriculum innovation especially broad impact institution
Because computer science change rapidly
Depending institution individual might mean conducting research traditional area developing new course teaching material based recent progress discipline conducting research nontraditional area curriculum teaching methodology
Institutions strongly emphasize teaching must moderate teaching load increase real support scholarly activity
Opportunities continued faculty development provided short course tutorial would available conference summer workshop
Internships industry university setting also available faculty institution remain current
Undergraduate course design take account requirement industry maintaining commitment sound pedagogical practice
The introductory course emphasize fundamental principle discipline advanced course often application strong theme
The breadth discipline taught early curriculum expense solid introduction programming incorporates problem solving software engineering design
design empowering essential experience undergraduate
A design course capstone research experience required undergraduate major
Such course aim give student experience solving significant problem confronting contemporary research issue
Examples include discussion semantics programming language verification issue software engineering theory issue database unsolvability algorithm
Faculties also look opportunity repackage traditional subject discipline including theoretical concept present new engaging way
Lab exercise textbook example reflect broadest range student concern contemporary life experience
Lectures alone without student interaction small group laboratory inadequate learning mechanism CS E education
While professional training already important mission community college many undergraduate program also provide practical course evening student appropriate individual mission need local community
Because student come CS E wide range learning style background We must view change pedagogy opportunistically view change research specialty
CS E educator slow take advantage new method teaching many current method ideally suited encouraging new student interest field
For instance interdisciplinary major program involving natural science economics psychology developed within setting concentration computer science
Some early progress sort made area computational science
At many institution first course serve interest mixed audience major nonmajors
The interest nonmajors field CS E increasingly strong sophisticated
These interest ought recognized development new course material effective teaching strategy
Priorities Master granting institution varied undergraduate program
Although graduate department change curriculum course nature granting institution requires faculty stay abreast recent trend field order productive researcher move forward tenure promotion
At time climate institution graduate program changing
Government funding level research significantly decreased indication suggest reduction occur
Universities may need develop closer tie industry maintain appropriate level research funding future
These change may engender change educational research mission CS E graduate program
Thus CS E graduate program face several unique challenge identified paragraph
The recent Taulbee Survey indicates roughly new employed industry government rather academia
At time number position available CS E department decreased remained constant since
In era fiscal retrenchment university level reasonable expect proportion employed academia decline
As academic department develop closer tie industry may affect course offering curriculum
However many hired industry ability see difficult project completion much expertise subject area
Thus although closer tie industry see graduate education continuing source strength department although funding may come different source
yet prepared particular balance academic priority department value
Many university graduate program beginning put increased emphasis educational initiative source funding undergraduate tuition large portion budget increased pressure student external source
Training teaching coping new job requires planning resource department currently provide
Departments must place new emphasis teaching skill graduate student many faculty
Although number program risen recent year department offering Master degree especially local industry provides demand
In response project Master degree may become common
Some department need consider providing different balance research applied activity research take smaller role program
Professional education thus widely accepted regular part academy
Some graduate program provide course evening student accordance need local community
The audience course would include industry professional educator whose technical knowledge need updated broadened new direction
The following issue apply specifically primary secondary school level computing education although idea may relevance undergraduate curriculum well
In natural science mathematics curriculum relatively well established
We believe important implement similar curriculum computer science identifies great idea computing idea affect world live
It follow idea presented ACM Model High School Curriculum introduces discipline broadly
The current AP curriculum serf narrow purpose satisfy need area
The biggest obstacle teaching computer science secondary school lack teacher appropriate skill training
A substantial effort area needed address problem
Students college exposure computer science need encouraged consider teaching career new program need instituted would offer new teacher appropriate training beginning career
Moreover teacher training must broad enough understand communicate student public CS E encompasses much broader range subject programming
There massive imbalance educational opportunity available student different school system
Students affluent school system many opportunity learn technology counterpart poorer district
Moreover even within single school system gap educator administrator comfortable technology also wide
A major effort needed bring faculty staff level speed computing technology integrate effectively widest range curricular subject
Activities like ACM undergraduate research award high school programming contest need revitalized
New activity might include starting high computer science problem magazine like one mathematics starting new summer course computer science secondary school teacher
There many computer science education community whose interest represented different organization including following advancement computing education ACM Education Board Computer Science Education Computer Uses Education ACM SIGACT Education Committee ACM Committee Consortium Computing Small Colleges CEEB AP Curriculum Committee Graduate education faculty issue accreditation computing technology higher education IFIP International undergraduate curriculum committee ISTE Computer Science Society technology secondary school education Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium Although community many common interest interact much
At moment member ACM Education Board appointed entirely discretion chair
As result different educational interest directly represented highest level within ACM
We believe ACM Education Board modify charter ensure representation constituency promote higher level interaction among
Such change would create visible representative proactive board could provide leadership ongoing process improving quality computer science education level
The Education Board also seek create new communication channel shared curricular concern effectively discussed
Moreover SIGCSE program committee representative secondary school community including AP graduate school community professional education community alongside undergraduate community
The recent decision switch Pascal programming language AP course excellent example issue better channel interconstituency communication might profoundly beneficial effect
As title make clear one major goal workshop working group identify direction work discipline strategic sense new investment area would provide greatest leverage advancing area whole
In seeking apply criterion computer science education working group concludes important strategic direction promote greater sharing educational resource exploiting power modern computing technology
In sense facilitating reuse curricular development educational software constitutes grand challenge CS E education much way reuse software remains grand challenge software engineering
Our vision develop distributed center tentatively called CS E Education Center would collect promote distribution material relevant computer science education
The service provided CS E Education Center would include following The audience course would include people workplace require continuing education course Java interactive Web software design course programming
It would also include handful student geographically dispersed need course subject curriculum compiler code generation optimization
At moment difficult mount course particular institution due limited local demand
A detailed discussion idea found
A great deal exploratory research needed challenge effectively met
A central question whether CS E Education Center provide adequate meaningful human interaction support educational function
For instance expert need answer student question timely manner well evaluate student work
The need support great public source industry benefit initiative
Some new program National Science Foundation especially EHR Directorate seem supporting exploration like one discussed
The establishment CS E Education Center may emerge exciting complex fundamentally important idea help ensure future vitality meaningful extension computing education next millennium

The strategic planning process take many path
It require month preparatory analysis simply use collective knowledge management team
Either method requires company make decision future course
In paper show use Strategic Filters way sift data make best decision
Then focus decision Wildly Important Goals WIGs resourced completed
Strategic Planning Strategic Filters Wildly Important Goals The driving force key differentiator competitive advantage company
The important element driving force proof
If want employee customer believe must find data back claim
Here list thing NOT acceptable example driving force The reason good example company claim everyone saying
If everyone saying one believe
Here driving force example marketplace believe real differentiator Once know agree Driving Force company use understand Emerging trend outside force control may impact business
These may include We want strategic filter may require change business model beyond internal competency customer requirement
They impact We lived time great external disruption
Books newspaper great example
Amazon changed book buying making almost every book ever published available either new warehouse used via partner
Instead buying bookstore buy whatever want get recommendation new book based previously bought read comment consumer buy
Then Amazon changed offering Kindle linked online bookstore
Now thousand book minute buy delivered wirelessly cell network
Newspapers magazine delivered Kindle every night AM
No ink printing late missing delivery service problem travel
Instead get perfect service
Now IPAD Apple promise embed graphic video within book magazine newspaper
This incorporate feature Kindle make reading experience completely different
Printers Publishers needed see trend coming survive thrive
These development shut huge company make others clear winner

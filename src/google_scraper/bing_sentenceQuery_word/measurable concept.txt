What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

To make learning list important computer science theory concept explained analogy minimal technical term
It like computer science degree program everyone get understand general concept
Important note Also check getting started programming
Say order Amazon download film collection online time
You want test method faster
The delivery take almost day arrive download completed minute earlier
Great
So tight race
For online shopping number purchased item input affect delivery time
The output constant
We call
For online downloading download time directly proportional movie file size input
We call
From experiment know online shopping scale better online downloading
It important understand big O notation help analyze algorithm
Big O notation represents algorithm
Let assume O O n scenario example
Someone movie theater asks row sitting
You lazy count ask person front
You simply add person answer get current row number
Brilliant right
However person front exactly thing
Finally question reach row answer I row
From correct message incremented one row pas way person asked
Here another example known
A nurse carrying tray box cocoa cup containing smaller image holding thing turn contains even smaller version image
Here
If still get recursion Otherwise continue reading
Let assume leak water pipe garden
You take bucket sealing material fix problem
After see leak much bigger need plumber bring bigger tool
In meanwhile still using bucket drain water
After notice massive underground stream opened
You need handle gallon water every second
Buckets useful anymore
You need completely new approach solve problem volume velocity water grown
To prevent town flooding may need government build massive dam requires enormous civil engineering expertise elaborate control system
Big data describes data set large complex impossible manage conventional data processing tool
Every computer scientist programmer least know Imagine going hiking goal reach highest peak possible
You already map start thousand possible path shown map
You lazy simply time evaluate
Screw map
You started hiking simple strategy greedy
Just take path
After trip ended whole body sore tired look hiking map first time
Oh god
There muddy river I crossed instead keep walking upwards
A greedy algorithm pick never reconsiders choice
This time climbing another hill
You determined find path lead highest peak
However map provided foggy
To make trip easier downloaded hiking app track path taken measure current altitude
You climb hill
Each time take exact path lead highest peak ever recorded somewhere choose
You also randomly choose different starting point known
So linger around area reduce probability getting stuck
The hill climbing algorithm attempt find better solution generating
Each neighboring solution generated based best solution far
It Mount Everest biggest challenge ever faced
Your goal reach summit impractical climb Mount Everest
You one chance
You cautious
Instead always climbing upwards reducing chance taking wrong path
The higher climb lower probability move lower point explore
The example describes yes memoization memorization approach dynamic programming store result previous computation future use
Pararth Shah wrote brilliant analogy long included
P v NP one popular important unsolved problem computer science field
Say I give multiplication question like x The answer
Easy solve right
What I reverse question x To solve assuming seen probably go possible number
We find easily
What I ask Could possibly
You answer right
Just divide
Multiplication easy
Finding original factor number hard
So P polynomial problem
Computer easily multiply super large number without spending significantly computer time small number
NP nondeterministic polynomial problem
Finding factor still fairly easy computer solve number
It impossible computer right
Here important part Are NP problem factorization also P problem multiplication discover efficient way solve NP problem
Are NP problem really hard solve need aha moment brilliant scientist
come efficient algorithm
Or maybe human dumb
Imagine exist machine life posse
They see u like see ant
Our level intelligence insignificant
Solving P v NP problem like solving
So P v NP problem important
If able prove mean solved easily within reasonable computer time
We able cure cancer break password etc
It
P v NP listed Clay Mathematics Institute
million awarded first correct solution
Read Also Computers work adding complexity top complexity
When drive car necessarily understand car engine work
The complex detail hidden
So computer turn binary code program
Here excellent video us domino visualize computer perform binary calculation basic fundamental level huge topic includes subfields like
Let say work secretary company A
You answer phone call arrange meeting typing document etc
You always task based priority
Every time phone ring stop whatever task working
Concurrency property program system allow task run time period
Eventually cope job much data entry task
You complain bos happily hire data entry clerk handle data entry task
Parallelism allows task run time provided machine capability
However implementation concurrency concept also introduces potential problem race condition
This happen allow concurrent transaction banking system race condition handled So handle situation
One really simple way mutual exclusion
Now whenever ongoing transaction system lock account involved transaction
This time moment transaction A occurs account locked
You withdraw money ATM
It unlocks transaction A completes
So mutual exclusion solves problem right
Yes nobody want get rejected ATM every time ongoing transaction
Let modify solution little bit
Now let set different priority level different type transaction
Say cash withdrawal request higher priority bank transfer
When withdraw money ATM transaction A bank transfer stop allow transaction B carry first higher priority
It resume transaction B completed
Binary semaphore simple
ongoing transaction
waiting
On hand counting semaphore allows process running time
Let say locker room manager spa
There locker
You keep track number key time receive hand key exactly know
If locker full others queue
Whenever someone done hand key first person queue
Deadlock another common issue concurrency system
Let use banking system analogy different scenario
Just keep mind access bank account locked whenever ongoing transaction
However since transaction completed access locked account
Both wait complete
Deadlock
Here real life example Let approach first
Let approach first
Hacking similar breaking house
Here popular hacking technique Try hundred thousand different key
An experienced burglar try commonly used key first
A attack usually start guessing commonly used password like abcdef etc
A couple moved next door
They really nice helpful
They often invite dinner
One day mentioned going vacation soon
They happily offered take care dog
You left spare key
Since heard news
Social engineering revealing private information
A burglar check every possible entry find easiest way weakness get
Maybe window left open know
A burglar pretend plumber unlock door
He fix leaking pipe everything look perfectly normal
After left discovered jewelry missing
A trojan horse malware program useful helpful run malicious code
Your door lock jammed call locksmith
He fix door lock secretly duplicate another key
A rootkit gain computer various way like social engineering disguise necessary file hard detect antivirus software
Here bookshop analogy
Imagine people visit little bookshop time
Your bookshop occupied others come
You ask leave seem coming group
They probably know
Most seem genuinely interested buy book
Some even ask book shelved
Someone counter pay penny
People keep coming hour
All look perfectly normal
At end day made one book sale
Remember guy pay penny
DDoS attempt bring site service visitor
Cryptography study application secure communication
Here widely used cryptographic protocol Say Alice Bob want send stuff
To make sure nobody see stuff lock box
They make identical symmetric key lock meet share key beforehand
Sharing identical key work fine among people
What Alice want exchange stuff another guy named Carl Alice want anybody see stuff
Alice use lock key shared Bob else Bob unlock box easily
Of course Alice share completely new different lock key Carl Alice want exchange stuff different people
She need keep manage different key
So Alice come brilliant solution
Now maintains key private key
She distribute padlock public key friend
Anyone close padlock encrypt key open decrypt
Now anyone send stuff Alice using padlock distributed Alice longer manage different key different people
If Alice want send something Carl ask Carl padlock public key use lock encrypt stuff send Carl
The basic principle everyone private key decrypt message provide sender public key message encryption
Read Also You figure need document requirement
Like waterfall way go back unless start
You move next phase current phase completed
You figure thing need beginning
Then continuously improve evolve collaborate adapt development go
Here popular implementation agile development methodology So graduated
You write good beautiful code hopefully everything perfect far
Let introduce software development methodology taught college
Next wonder suck estimating development time And methodology often implemented wrongly So go
Computer science nutshell
Feel free suggest new computer science theory concept add think important often confusing
Computer scientist like physicist programmer like engineer
Writing specific instruction dumb yet obedient machine
What mean
Imagine teach kid shower
The kid know follow instruction
So ask kid Oh wait The kid even remove clothes entering shower
That computer work
You tell computer exactly need
It know assume never think consequence
Getting zone like falling asleep
Imagine waking person close falling asleep second
Now spend time fall back sleep
They related
Java Javascript similar like car carpet similar
JQuery library built top JavaScript
Javascript ugly nerd jQuery wizard turn handsome quarterback
You call library
Framework call
A library tool
A framework way life
It impossible tell
The number even negative developer paying
Measuring software productivity line code like measuring progress airplane much weighs
Objects noun method verb
Objects like people
They living breathing thing knowledge inside thing memory inside remember thing
And rather interacting interact high level abstraction like right
Here example If I laundry object give dirty clothes send message say Can get clothes laundered I happen know best laundry place San Francisco
And I speak English I dollar pocket
So I go hail taxicab tell driver take place San Francisco
I go get clothes laundered I jump back cab I get back
I give clean clothes say Here clean You idea I
You knowledge laundry place
Maybe speak French even hail taxi
You pay one dollar pocket
Yet I knew
And know
All complexity hidden inside able interact high level abstraction
That object
They encapsulate complexity interface complexity high level
At restaurant order food call API menu APIs
Once food ready API response ready waiter serve food
The basic idea ask want system return response without exposing happening behind scene
NoSQL database store information like would recipe book
When want know make cake go recipe information make cake ingredient preparation mixing baking finishing etc
one page
SQL like shopping ingredient recipe
In order get ingredient cart go many different aisle get ingredient
When done shopping grocery cart full ingredient run around collect
Wouldn nicer store organized recipe could go one place store grab everything need one spot
Granted find ingredient like egg different place bit overhead stocking shelf consumer standpoint much find looking

This goooooood
Thanks Yash
I actually adding theory right improving explanation stay tuned
Keep posted Very helpful analogy
However Asymmetric cryptography section I think Alice realize brilliant thought find solve initial problem sending stuff Carl people
You mean part distribute padlock friend
The thing asymmetric cryptography eliminates need managing different key different people
Alice need keep one key distributes padlock duplicating
I meant earlier part first paragraph
From I understand Carl send stuff Alice great still leaf Alice unable send stuff Carl Carl lock going help open package Alice original problem
The original problem number key person increase number friend increase
You right Alice send stuff Carl Carl easily send lock Alice Carl need manage single key
The basic idea everyone need manage one private key broadcast public key anyone
If case You remove line What Alice want send stuff another guy named Carl Alice want anybody see stuff I happy
You could also change problem If Alice could receive stuff want maintain separate everybody problem would make sense
Updated
Thanks lot pointing mistake
You welcome
Thank helpful post
Incredibly good post
This give analogy I would never thought otherwise I use advising client
Thanks
You welcome
Dear Carl Cheo Wow
Thanks man I understand car used car explanation
Now I understand computer science
Sincerely Jafnee You welcome Jafnee
That really good post learn concept remember
As request could add Actor model Concurrency point Noted
Will consider add
I Javascript jQuery example
How Javascript ugly nerd jQuery wizard turn handsome quarterback This good added article
That really dynamic programming
Your description really caching
Maybe functional language caching
The analogy indeed memoization approach I updated section avoid confusion
Thanks pointing
What analogy article describes regard nosql actually denormalisation
An analogy nosql would telling taxi driver route travel instead list location arrive
The taxi driver spend much time looking map assuming satnav
Don really get analogy mind elaborate
More More By way tnx Dude
Since im beginner computer help lot
Tnx Man No problem Edwin
yeah enthusiastic analogy
kind rude really tell except jquery nicer look
otherwise great post thanks
I removed analogy sorry offended
appreciate
think really valuable post thanks work writing compiling
I teacher thankfull core heart You welcome Sabeeh
Your section P NP incorrect misleading
Specifically defined membership NP easy verify hard solve
The qualification needed NP part problem easy verify
Hard solve precludes P otherwise affect NP way
Also kind nitpicking impossible reasonable amount say uncomputable
Thank
A small list top would make great reference Will add ASAP
Yes like table content easier navigation
Thank though thorough explanation
hiiii india simply Hats ur effort
Thanks Swarup
I hope mind I shared Facebook group I member aim help educate science science communication
It called Science Media also aim help teach tool skepticism
I hoping member enjoy
Thank sharing
Of course I mind
It meant help many people possible
I Professor Computer Science I bet best giving real world analogy explain complex CS concept ton This great thank much
Some really Layamn term
For example text data structure redirects Wikipedia
And Wikipedia horrible source people
It sometimes horrible even technical people tends show simple thing complicated way
It fact time make new Wiki try show thing simple possible simpler paraphrase old Chinese proverb
I LOVING
Learning ton
Thanks
One first analogy say What I order several I believe mean What I order several movie collection one
Even original Harry Potter example still several movie
Thanks
As student IT I MUST thank deeply
Really thanks lot
hacking mean cracking Hi carl
The p v np analogy easy solve factoring
Simply find square root divide every number le reach find factor
So instead going test
Obviously know rule factoring divisible number check
odd possibility
No check
And rule factoring multiple sum multiple
The sum multiple
So number test
Hope help
Pay million
This awesomely great Carl

lot
This cool article
May I translate article Chinese
This excellent
I appreciate compiling creating sharing well
It fantastic resource I know help student educator
Plus made laugh loud

amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

Individual Education Programs IEPs vital part educational system
They similar program designed help individual improve performance
Let think moment development exercise program plan garden
An exercise plan type plan help individual improve overall fitness health
A garden plan help increase aesthetic environment help produce food consumption
The basically plan student struggle disability hinders academic success
Each IEP collaborative effort IEP team usually includes teacher administrator evaluator parent student special education specialist
IEPs several component similar example
When individual develops fitness plan one might determine current weight BMI determine area concern develop goal select action plan
A person planting garden might determine challenge landscape budget plan implementation
IEP team help design program aimed helping student succeed
These plan include report containing student performing academically behaviorally socially relation educational task
Additionally annual goal objective assessment data information current service student placement also included report
Goals IEP important
Goals IEP must
They include
Goals realistic
For example person new exercise regiment would run marathon first week
Additionally garden would produce flower produce within week
IEP goal take consideration current performance including observation data
A student might several area warrant attention however team determines student focus year
Team member must ask area concern help student
When goal written must ask student reach goal year
Get FREE access day create account
Goals measurable
A fitness goal would exercise personal enjoyment
Usually goal would run mile week lose two pound week increase number pushup given week
Goals IEP need measurable need include way ass whether student met
They may contain concrete number percentage
Goals number
Too many goal make difficult student parent teacher remember
It also good practice use simple clear concise language writing goal
Extravagant verbose language place IEP
Student support claim thesis statement reason evidence

Student include least two reason two piece evidence support thesis statement

Student score level two area evidence support determined writing rubric

Student use graphic organizer organize reason evidence writing assignment
An IEP specially designed individual student
Goals determined team An IEP report isolated school use articulation program individual student accessed student parent educator

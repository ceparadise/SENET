In set cover SC problem given universe U set n element collection S set whose union equal universe
The set cover problem identify smallest S whose union equal universe
If I add constraint SC new problem still
My attempt follows To construct instance new problem Yes still
If instance n pad U n new element add new subset containing new element
The original instance solution size padded instance solution size
The reduction obviously polynomial time

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

What cardinality following set M M Turing Machine LA M L recursively enumerable language L Which mean many TMs semidecide recursively enumerable language L
We know set
language countably infinite encode TM binary number thus integer therefore define bijection set TMs N
Thus M countable
I feel like proof would actually work
Can anybody point right direction
Any help would greatly appreciated

I huge trouble understanding cardinality
Let say Doctor perform heart surgery one patient
Surely many doctor many patient model like
Does need reflect many doctor many patient
Or describes relationship two actual instance
Another example Hospital run experiment many patient drug trial
Each trial test one drug patient appear one trial
MANY TO ONE patient trial allowed one patient take one drug
But indicate patient appear trial
Or implicit relation Trial Patient side Trial
In term actual entity representation would work something like If relation one entity corresponding table included corresponding record
Patient Hospital Bed Patient Hospital Bed
In case Hospital Bed represented column bed number collection column Patients table
If relationship create Foreign Key relationship first entity primary key entity second M entity
Patient take Drug Drug taken Many Patients
In case DrugId would foreign key Patients table
Finally case relationship typical technique create contain two foreign key one entity perhaps column
Doctor work Many Hospitals Hospital employ Many Doctors
Therefore association table say MedicalJobs foreign key HospitalId DoctorId perhaps Salary JobId etc
Concerning Trial Patient question one trial many patient patient participate one trial many relationship therefore need foreign key TrialId Patients table
I hope clear
If need additional explanation please comment post

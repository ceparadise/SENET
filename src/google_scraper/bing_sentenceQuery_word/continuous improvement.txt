The specifies procedure department follows ensure continuous improvement undergraduate degree program
The department recognizes order provide program meet need undergraduate must make use multiple form feedback assessment collect data need evaluate current status program make sound recommendation improvement
To guide process department established set program outcome program objective BS degree program
statement made skill capability senior BSCS major time graduate
statement made skill capability Computer Science alumnus approximately three five year graduate
The truth assertion established via assessment evaluation mechanism described policy
The department website used make continuous document available public including listing outcome objective continuous improvement policy annual report
An archive past version document also maintained along summary basis change made
Two committee Undergraduate Committee Curriculum Committee charged designing maintaining course degree requirement program way ensure program outcome objective met
Duties related task continuous program improvement committee described document
The department Continuous Improvement Policy based following process These process based use following This information used Faculty Curriculum Undergraduate Committees make change program address problem improve quality
Each year fall semester Curriculum Committee review input following source order ass continuing validity Program Outcomes Objectives If reviewing input Curriculum Committee determines need modify either outcome objective draft proposed change present faculty review
The Curriculum Committee Faculty iterate approval granted faculty time revised outcome objective reposted department website
During final year ABET cycle program outcome objective reviewed department advisory board
Any suggested modification fed regular department review cycle
The department faculty define success criterion student meet respect Program Outcomes Program Objectives
Student success assessed annually
Program Outcomes assessed term successful completion specific coursework based Program Outcome Success Criteria adopted faculty
All student graduating BSCS program must exposed course work provides understanding ABET criterion
The department curriculum designed ensure meeting ABET requirement foundation course requiring student graduating pas either CSCI CSCI case capstone option taken student
The foundation course require student achievement criterion except professional development related criterion
The senior project option CSCI provide coverage topic exception security covered CSCI
Because importance ensuring adequate coverage topic ensure meeting ABET criterion content delivery foundation course CSCI CSCI closely monitored controlled Curriculum Committee
If student fails successfully complete one option must either repeat course elect another capstone option complete following academic year
For student electing complete CSCI capstone option additional review achievement program outcome conducted via survey completed project sponsor Sponsor May year
In lieu exit exam Department review achievement select student assessment designed measure student achievement program outcome
The student selected random capstone option number proportional number student taking capstone
After graduation year student success achieving faculty defined criterion student success achieving Program Outcomes assessed based achievement randomly selected subset student
Student success achieving Program Objectives assessed via Alumni Survey annually Employer Survey available
These survey administered CEAS
The Alumni Survey run annually sent student year graduation
The Employer Survey run every year
Upon completion success study year Curriculum Committee provides summary report faculty review review student success plan improvement
Upon approval faculty result published department annual report
All undergraduate Computer Science course exception special topic course independent study course course required make publicly available basis course profile
The Curriculum Committee review course profile foundation course annually
The course profile includes following information The course profile used track important information course represents contract taught course department expect student successfully complete course
The Curriculum Committee must review change course profile change become official
This review ensures consistency across course offering maintained change related course outcome adversely affect course dependent outcome
All externally visible change must announced faculty department
Faculty Course Questionnaires FCQs administered University every term instructor class taught
FCQs allow student rate instructor course provide information instructor teaching improvement student course selection dean chair management
Detailed FCQ result available CU Faculty Course Questionnaire website summary FCQ result Computer Science course available Computer Science Faculty Course Questionnaires website
The Curriculum Committee review FCQ rating course October February year
For course rating fall faculty member taught course required submit report documenting reason low rating suggesting improvement strategy
To assist department goal improving quality undergraduate program Curriculum Committee adopting uniform policy respect collection course material undergraduate course course repository
This information also useful maintaining course dossier must presented ABET reviewer ABET site visit
Course repository maintained either moodle bitbucket
It must include following item These material must archived within month close semester course taught
Because different nature course Senior Thesis Project course follow different guideline
The final thesis document undergraduate senior thesis must submitted Main Office Administrator electronic form stored online
In project course artifact document source code often undergo multiple change throughout semester
Rather collecting version artifact course coordinator collect completed project team archive
Projects completed three project team representing low medium high performing team submitted
In sponsored project course possible collect project artifact
At minimum archive project must contain sponsor evaluation peer evaluation team advisor evaluation team poster project summary class presentation
The Curriculum Committee responsible ensure material collected instance undergraduate course assist process collecting material course taught previous semester
In particular reminder asking course material sent end last week class
A second reminder sent start first week class next semester
Finally third reminder sent starting third week semester course taught weekly reminder sent required material acquired
In order ensure ABET criterion satisfied BSCS graduate stability content delivery foundation course CSCI CSCI must assured semester semester
In order achieve goal faculty member provided course syllabus two month beginning semester
If faculty member wish change course outcome textbook suggested change must reported Curriculum Coordinator
If course foundation course CSCI CSCI suggested change must reviewed Curriculum Committee iterate faculty member agreement reached
When course change approved syllabus revised old version archived future reference made publicly available department Courses web page
Each year College Engineering Applied Science administers number survey collect information various college stakeholder student alumnus employer used ass quality College department program
These survey include The Curriculum Committee make use data survey one point independent feedback concerning quality BS degree program whether goal program stated program outcome program objective met
In particular The board job provide external evaluation feedback Department goal continuously improving undergraduate program

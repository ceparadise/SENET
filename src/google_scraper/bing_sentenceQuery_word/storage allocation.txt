Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
We mainly study heap stack data structure act storage allocation area memory
Is queue also storage allocation area memory
As far I know process control block made OS region actually also act storage allocation area I consider queue storage allocation area memory
You misled homonym
There container item added time recently added removed
And function argument local variable return value return address
There one stack memory area per thread
The two concept name stack memory area organized stack data structure item added function call executed removed upon return function since function call nested item removed last one added yet removed
There tree ordered item node hold smaller value
And storage allocated dynamically
There one heap per process
The two concept completely unrelated name finite supply English word roughly right connotation happens word picked
There reason word name data structure also name area memory
There queue data structure operating system course area memory called
Process control block organized queue storage allocation area common name place memory operating system store information process every operating system information one place every OS description mention control
seems studied computer architecture yet
I try explain
You ca OS use queue storage location memory heap stack implented hardware
To use queue storage area need hardware
To know heap work see

The essential requirement memory management provide way dynamically allocate portion memory program request free reuse longer needed
This critical advanced computer system single might underway time
Several method devised increase effectiveness memory management
system separate memory address used process actual physical address allowing separation process increasing size beyond available amount using swapping
The quality virtual memory manager extensive effect overall system performance
Modern computer system manage memory two level memory management generally categorized either automatic memory management usually involving
The task fulfilling allocation request consists locating block unused memory sufficient size
Memory request satisfied allocating portion large pool memory called
At given time part heap use free unused thus available future allocation
Several issue complicate implementation arises many small gap allocated memory block invalidates use allocation request
The allocator also inflate size individually small allocation
This often managed
The memory management system must track outstanding allocation ensure overlap memory ever lost
The specific dynamic memory allocation algorithm implemented impact performance significantly
A study conducted illustrates involved variety allocator
The lowest average required allocate single memory slot measured instruction level variety software
Since precise location allocation known advance memory accessed indirectly usually
The specific algorithm used organize memory area allocate deallocate chunk interlinked may use following method block allocation also called memory pool allocation us block memory often size
This work well simple large object need allocated suffers especially long memory address
However due significantly reduced overhead method substantially improve performance object need frequent allocation often used
In system memory allocated several pool memory instead one pool represents block memory certain size block convenient size progression
All block particular size kept sorted new block formed allocation added respective memory pool later use
If smaller size requested available smallest available size selected split
One resulting part selected process repeat request complete
When block allocated allocator start smallest sufficiently large block avoid needlessly breaking block
When block freed compared buddy
If free combined placed correspondingly list
In many programming language implementation variable declared within procedure subroutine function local function runtime environment program automatically allocates memory variable program execution entry procedure automatically release memory procedure exited
Special declaration may allow local variable retain value invocation procedure may allow local variable access procedure
The automatic allocation local variable make possible depth limited available memory
Garbage collection strategy automatically detecting memory allocated object longer usable program returning allocated memory pool free memory location
This method contrast manual memory management programmer explicitly code memory request memory release program
While automatic garbage advantage reducing programmer workload preventing certain kind memory allocation bug garbage collection require memory resource compete application program processor time
method decoupling memory organization physical hardware
The application operate memory via
Each time attempt access stored data made virtual memory data order translate virtual address
In way addition virtual memory enables granular control memory system method access
In virtual memory system operating system limit access memory
This feature called used disallow process read write memory allocated preventing malicious malfunctioning code one program interfering operation another
Even though memory allocated specific process normally isolated process sometimes need able share information
one fastest technique
Memory usually classified access rate
Memory management system among operation also handle moving information two level memory

In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

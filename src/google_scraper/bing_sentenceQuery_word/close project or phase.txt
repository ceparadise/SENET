Close Project Phase Inputs Tools Techniques You Motivation Theories You Should Know PMP Certification Exam Basic Quality Planning Tools You Should Know WBS Outputs PMP Certification Exam What You Should Know Stakeholder Registers Related Book By The Close Project Phase process last process need preparation PMP Certification Exam mark culmination phase project life cycle completion entire project
Finalizing activity across Project Management process group formally complete project phase
To formally close phase project life cycle entire project need compare accepted deliverable information project management plan
Remember Accepted deliverable output Validate Scope process
At end get formal approval acceptance completed deliverable
At end accepted deliverable approval deliverable final approval acceptance final product
The project management plan document project life cycle instruction close project phase
Each phase specific deliverable need complete accepted considered closed
Oftentimes additional criterion need met considering phase closed
Your organizational process asset OPAs describe phase project closure guideline
Examples phase closure criterion include At end phase project sponsor customer along project management team discus performance metric phase project overall
They look risk event occurred current phase status issue corrective action need taken
The end phase good time make sure element project management plan accurate date
Some project manager wait phase gate update plan latest version
If iterative life cycle collect information next iteration Close Project Phase process
You also go assumption risk log close item update remaining item
Some project manager collect new requirement change assumption risk formally initiate new phase
It good practice collect lesson learned go project
At end phase formalizing lesson learned phase integrating lesson next phase help ensure repeat mistake
You use team expertise customer feedback measure deliverable element project management plan determine whether project complete
The project scope statement document product scope product acceptance criterion project deliverable
You review project scope statement requirement documentation baseline scope schedule cost relevant information project management plan make sure successfully met project product completion requirement
Analytical technique used record final project performance measurement technical schedule budget performance
The cause variance identified recorded lesson learned document
Conduct lesson learned meeting least end every phase often different resource different phase
Make sure get stakeholder input people leave project complete
In event project terminates completion conduct formal closure process existing information
You want document progress made work remains unfinished reason project termination
Oftentimes project restarted month even year later good record project status closed helpful

No credit card required Close Project Phase Close Project Phase process finalizing activity across Project Management Process Groups formally complete project phase
The key benefit process provides lesson learned formal ending project work release organization resource pursue new endeavor
The input tool technique output process depicted
depicts data flow diagram process
When closing project project manager No credit card required

For purpose project design mean visual graphical design site well implementation detail underlie
Your design document describe finished site look like make work
There alternative view design prove helpful
This view design clear detailed complete could principle mail team abroad could implement website without consulting client
The idea leave nothing implicit unspoken understanding party
An important part design set image picture want page look like perhaps common element logo navbar
You create mockups favorite editor tool Photoshop Pixlr Illustrator Power Point etc
Once done save export web image format GIF JPEG PNG upload folder named folder shared team account
Here set mockup image
If received necessary image text client logo history organization feel free use dummy image text
Hopefully fill coding
For focus layout page size alignment font color border
You use image design document picture really worth word describing page layout
The final product design phase webpage contains structured essay combination text image mockup page
The document webpage contain component Note form JavaScript application using JavaScript process form data
Do get confused
You know writing JavaScript code
Here seen still see course
Please note item must constructed entirely copied external website Web though modify code class material
Once fulfill minimum requirement code allowed get code web source attribution incorporate certain advanced component
image gallery transition count part minimum requirement
Now know design document read following section get detail part document
Your design say create clear complete concise
Design includes organization navigation site
What page
How connected
What sequence step user need take common task
For example user often visit site find next game describe path follow get information
In case requirement user find looking quickly easily solution site organizational navigational scheme allows
Important process informed knowledge user behavioral pattern studied
An excellent description design choice contain reference pattern learned reading
Design also cover layout appearance page
To guide process go back reading lecture note layout strategy
Think bit target audience remember may certain disability thus design accessibility issue mind see reading
Also remember every user precisely size screen think page layout flexible still look okay variety size
Document decision make
Do afraid specific design wo allowed change mind later
You may change mind coding document document submit along code
See
Rather duplicating code element site appear multiple page handle repetitious item using shared file JavaScript code shared file using SSI
Repetitious element include thing like Depending project achieving modularity may large task
Therefore implementation modularity shared partner since assigning one partner may result uneven work load
In professional setting many people may involved implementing website designed
To avoid stepping one another implementation must planned determining order part built time
Some part may built early allow testing subsequent part depend
We also need deadline various part management need know far team behind schedule software project almost never time
Finally need determine build part everything get built nothing get assigned two people
In project even though team two issue arise
Ideally good plan allow two teammate work independently without meet constantly discus page
call page I link
like
Thus design document must also include
The plan must cover following Our intention plan helpful make sure
A good way organize information create table column file name file description one line description deadline assigned person item
The organizational scheme similar example point clearly concrete name file
Your document saved file named uploaded folder folder team account
Use subfolder store mockup file
Make sure image saved Web format GIF PNG JPEG Photoshop proprietary format size big
Be sure submitted web page
It surprisingly common student submit work missing broken image missing CSS like
You practiced skill homework far use
Use following URL check submission If mockups large width height use attribute make fit page make link clicked show image new page
See due date
The lateness policy may turn hour late penalty
Please make change document submission deadline
While need make change design plan go separate document submitted end coding phase
Thus keep track change document
Your document include component described section
Your mockups reflect text description page close possible coded page eventually look like
We look well mockups convey purpose goal website well whether appropriate intended audience
For example one target audience child well color font image general layout speak audience cheerful bright overcrowded etc
Your writing formal clear concise
You make sure error spelling grammar punctuation mechanic writing
These example drawn earlier semester course somewhat different may helpful
Here example project featured
Notice design document close final website change described code submitted

The close project phase last phase
This involves closing project making report level success owner
It also involves handing remaining deliverable customer passing documentation business releasing staff equipment canceling contract supplier informing stakeholder closure
The first step implementing close project phase create project closure report rejected sponsor
The report determine indeed need close project
In nutshell close project phase finalizing activity within complete project
The benefit tool provides formal method end project release resource pursue new project endeavor
Once project management plan closed review usually done determine success project well identify lesson learned
This project management term defined edition

Every project temporary undertaking therefore start date finish date meaning every project eventually come end close project phase process used
The Close project phase process thought process performs controlled shut end project
As normal within project documentation archived capturing lesson learned passed future project ensuring contract properly shut updating organizational process asset
Most project also split series phase stage therefore close project phase process may used end phase stage well end project
The purpose gather project record disseminate information order gain project product acceptance perform project closure Many project final allowed drift often several week month officially closed
Not situation cause delay handing life business area also incur additional labour cost project team continue book time project
The aim therefore use process execute timely controlled project shutdown
If process also used close particular phase stage within project assist providing latest information project board sponsor make informed choice whether proceed next phase stage
Clearly activity may needed process used close phase stage degree common sense needed
As mentioned part process ensures adequate documentation record updated support decision made also provide valuable source lesson future project well concise audit trail necessary
Such record documentation become new modified organizational process asset use future project
The following diagram summarizes close project phase process show main input tool output Key activity typically include This single document guide executing monitoring control closure project even though document actually made several document
The project management plan therefore major important input source reference make decision whether project phase indeed complete
The project management plan contains many plan within include scope requirement cost schedule quality communication risk management procurement stakeholder information
You see therefore document used major source reference part closing project phase
As name suggests deliverable whole purpose project undertaken first place
These deliverable must acceptable appropriate stakeholder deployed live business area
Such deliverable already passed control quality validate scope process ensure meet specification completeness correctness
Notice input output
The reason fairly obvious original process asset need updated result knowledge change made project
The formal acceptance product documented archive future reference
The Warranty period may start point time In way value added organization light experience asset refined updated
Organizational process asset may take form information tool documentation organizational knowledge
It part job member project contribute asset wherever whenever possible
Some example organizational process asset may include This used whenever project team project manager sufficient knowledge expertise
Therefore expert may come within organization external may paid consultant simply individual offering free advice guidance
Such technique used understand root cause generate potential forecast option
Such analysis done either structured unstructured manner
Using fishbone Ishikawa diagram one type analytical tool may used
Such tool may used generate recommendation lesson learned
These may used inviting appropriate stakeholder expert work one input output close project phase process
This refers accepted deliverable acceptance hand responsibility appropriate user owner
Such user owner may include customer end user operational management support sustaining group fact individual group responsible life business use
For transition successful implies product already accepted ready deployment within life business area
Here end project one phase information obtained tool provided purchased bout additional knowledge experience gained
Project record file archived In addition new documentation may also created
All updated organizational process asset passed appropriate group individual responsible maintaining
Such group may often project office central project support group
Study time leisure pas PMP Exam first time flying colour

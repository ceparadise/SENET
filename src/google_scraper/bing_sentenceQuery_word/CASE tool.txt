From development system design coding testing maintenance computerized tool used throughout software ensure finished product high quality minimal defect manner possible
Utilizing CASE tool help make possible software developer
The term CASE date back early created corporation developed first tool evaluate software
Computer company began utilize idea hardware manufacturing apply toward development software
Ultimately goal create software cost company least still becoming best product possible meeting customer demand
Case tool classified Upper CASE tool Lower CASE tool
The upper case tool focus beginning stage system development planning objective goal
The information necessary gathered upper CASE tool presented organized way
Lower CASE tool focus later part system development designing coding testing software defect functionality implementation maintaining software
These latter stage often think think software design testing maintaining fact play huge role software development
Many software engineering job require knowledge various CASE tool familiarity CASE entail tool important pursuing career software engineering
If interested CASE tool probably already studying software engineering something related information system mathematics
There course tutorial undergraduate graduate level focus specifically CASE
Many software engineering program least entail CASE tool coursework would grant head start toward expertise using
Rather extensive training using may give example background benefit using
If already software engineer consider expanding knowledge CASE tool continuing education broaden job prospect
There many different type CASE tool serve different purpose may good idea software engineer become familiar variety benefit
Additionally CASE tool continually developed becoming readily available affordable capable
Continuing education help keep top development
As software engineering becomes complex business seeking possible need CASE tool knowledge complex continue important
Many study done use CASE tool result point benefit importance correct use strong software developer

Most various tool vendor added support method tool
In addition new product arose designed bottom support approach
Andersen developed project Eagle alternative Foundation
Several thought leader development developed methodology CASE tool set Jacobsen Rumbaugh etc
Eventually diverse tool set method consolidated via standard led OMG
The OMG UML currently widely accepted industry standard modeling
Fuggetta classified CASE software different category CASE tool support specific task software development
They divided following category Another common way distinguish CASE tool distinction Upper CASE Lower CASE
Upper CASE Tools support business analysis modeling
They support traditional diagrammatic language etc
Lower CASE Tools support development activity physical design debugging construction testing component integration maintenance reverse engineering
All activity span entire apply equally upper lower CASE
Workbenches integrate two CASE tool support specific activity
Hence achieve An example workbench Microsoft programming environment
It incorporates several development tool GUI builder smart code editor debugger etc
Most commercial CASE product tended workbench seamlessly integrated two tool
Workbenches also classified manner tool focusing Analysis Development Verification etc
well focused upper case lower case process configuration management span complete
An environment collection CASE tool workbench attempt support complete software process
This contrast tool focus one specific task specific part
CASE environment classified Fuggetta follows In practice distinction workbench environment flexible
Visual Basic example programming workbench also considered environment many
The feature distinguished workbench environment deep integration via shared repository common language kind methodology integrated environment domain specificity
Some significant risk factor organization adopting CASE technology include

CASE tool short Software Engineering tool tool used developer develop manage maintain software system
CASE tool fall three category Upper CASE tool Lower CASE tool Integrated CASE tool
Examples CASE tool include diagram tool documentation tool process modeling tool analysis design tool system software tool project management tool design tool prototyping tool configuration manage tool programming tool Web development tool testing tool maintenance tool quality assurance tool database management tool tool
Upper CASE tool support analysis design phase software system include tool report generator analysis tool
Examples lower CASE tool code designer program editor tool support coding testing debugging phase
Integrated CASE tool support analysis design coding phase
CASE tool offer several benefit
These include improved project management improved system quality increased productivity reduced development time effort easier better maintenance software system better documentation
A CASE tool flexible easily integrated support standard software development technique methodology
In spite fact CASE tool cheap help create software system

learn share knowledge build career
Which Software Engineering tool use
In way increase productivity help design program
Or case use CASE tool reason
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
The best CASE tool I work
It lightweight comparing Rose easier buy cheaper extremely powerful
You could great UML diagram database model anything else want nice organised way
It greatly help initial stage elaboration process could create domain model preliminary use case map requirement present nice way customer
It help thinking I design I satisfied enough start proper documentation
It also good database model could database neatly
The quite serious drawback eye documentation generator put mildly crap
Getting proper document almost impossible unless invest significant amount work template would Oracle Designer Not using
No money
I used Rational Rose similar package past
Mostly I used UML diagram element gone detailed functionality code generation etc
I mostly use aiding design process clarifying idea
Often I find trying come design componant I end needing write draw I want happen I get clear overview mind need happen
I found lot case I end trying draw essentially predefined kind diagram UML Use Case Diagram etc
adopting style becomes easier get idea paper I framework work within
So I use CASE tool principally thier UML designing tool highish level

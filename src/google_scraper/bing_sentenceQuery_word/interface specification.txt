well designed interface resource software major disastrous functionality stability
Interfaces software component provide type specification
Sometimes public also defined part interface
The interface software module deliberately defined separately module
The latter contains actual code procedure method described interface well private variable procedure etc
Another software module example interacts forced published interface
One practical advantage arrangement replacing implementation another implementation interface cause internally meet requirement interface relevant specification interface

In language term often used define contains data code defines behavior signature
A code data method corresponding interface said interface
Furthermore class implement multiple interface hence different type time
An interface thus definition anywhere object exchanged example call object exchanged defined term interface rather specifying particular
This approach mean class implement interface used
For example may used allow development progress final implementation available
In another case implementation may substituted testing
Such implementation replaced real code later development process
Usually method defined interface contains code thus called must implemented code run invoked
An interface called might define two method
It implemented different way example first fast working stack fixed size second using data structure resized cost somewhat lower speed
Though interface contain many method may contain one even none
For example language defines interface single method various implementation used different purpose including
like contain method serve provide information generic processing using

Still question
Ask

In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

In set definition tool building
In general term set clearly defined method various software component
A good API make easier develop providing building block put together
An API may system
An API specification take many form often includes specification
example different form APIs
Documentation API usually provided facilitate usage
Just make easier people use program application programming interface make easier use certain technology building application
By underlying implementation exposing object action developer need API simplifies programming
While graphical interface might provide user button performs step fetching highlighting new email API file might give developer copy file one location another without requiring developer understand operation occurring behind scene
An API usually related
The API describes prescribes specification library set rule
A single API multiple implementation none abstract form different library share programming interface
The separation API implementation allow program written one language use library written another
For example compile compatible Scala developer take advantage Java API
API use vary depending type programming language involved
An API could primarily consist basic routine execute code manipulate data handle error API would provide specification class
also APIs
By mapping feature capability one language interface implemented another language language binding allows library service written one language used developing another language
Tools interface generator facilitate creation interface
An API also related framework based several library implementing several APIs unlike normal use API access behavior built framework mediated extending content new class plugged framework
Moreover overall program flow control control caller hand framework via similar mechanism
An API specify interface application
example specifies set common APIs aim enable application written POSIX conformant operating system another POSIX conformant operating system
example operating system implement POSIX APIs
shown strong commitment API particularly within library older application may run newer version Windows using setting called Compatibility Mode
An API differs ABI API source code based ABI based
For instance provides APIs provides ABI
Remote APIs allow developer manipulate remote resource specific standard communication allow different technology work together regardless language platform
For example Java Database Connectivity API allows developer query many different type set function API us allow function operate remotely appear local developer
Therefore remote APIs useful maintaining object abstraction method call executed locally proxy object invokes corresponding method remote object using remoting protocol acquires result used locally return value
A modification proxy object also result corresponding modification remote object
Web APIs defined interface interaction happen enterprise application use asset
An API approach architectural approach revolves around providing programmable interface set service different application serving different type consumer
When used context API typically defined set HTTP request message along definition structure response message usually Extensible Markup Language JavaScript Object Notation format
An example might shipping company API added web site facilitate ordering shipping service automatically include current shipping rate without site developer enter shipper rate table web database
While web API historically virtually synonymous recent trend moving away Simple Object Access Protocol based web service SOA towards direct REST style ROA
Part trend related movement toward RDF concept promote technology
Web APIs allow combination multiple APIs new application known
In social medium space web APIs allowed web community facilitate sharing content data community application
In way content created one place dynamically posted updated multiple location web
The design API significant impact usability
The principle describes role programming interface enabling hiding implementation detail module user module need understand complexity inside module
Thus design API attempt provide tool user would expect
The design programming interface represents important part organization complex piece software
Several author created recommendation design APIs Kin Lane Michi Henning
APIs one common way technology company integrate
Those provide use APIs considered member business ecosystem
The main policy releasing API An important factor API becomes public
Changes developer part example adding new parameter function break compatibility client depend API
When part publicly presented API subject change thus stable part particular API explicitly documented
For example library part considered unstable might change near future marked
A public API sometimes declare part
This usually mean part API considered candidate removed modified backward incompatible way
Therefore deprecation allows developer transition away part API removed unsupported future
API documentation describes service API offer use service aiming cover everything client would need know use API
Documentation crucial development maintenance application use API
API documentation traditionally found documentation file also found social medium blog forum Q A website
Traditional documentation file often presented via documentation system consistent appearance structure
However type content included documentation differs API API
To facilitate understanding API documentation include description class method API well typical usage scenario code snippet design rationale performance discussion contract implementation detail API service usually omitted
Restrictions limitation API used also covered documentation
For example documentation API function could note parameter null function
Because API documentation comprehensive difficult writer keep documentation updated user read carefully potentially resulting
API documentation enriched information like
This metadata used compiler tool environment implement custom behavior custom handling
In sued distributed new implementation embedded operating system
Google acquired permission reproduce Java API although permission given similar project
Judge ruled case APIs victory Oracle would widely expanded copyright protection allowed copyrighting simple software command To accept Oracle claim would allow anyone copyright one version code carry system command thereby bar others writing different version carry part command
In however Alsup ruling overturned appeal though question whether use APIs constitutes left unresolved
In following trial jury determined Google reimplementation Java API constituted fair use Oracle vowed appeal decision

The system life cycle broken five stage Analysis Design Implementation Operation Maintenance
Gathering data essential analysis stage gain clear insight problem
If problem identified correctly poor solution guaranteed follow
A requirement specification contains system able done
This include A feasibility report produced analysis design stage
It include There number different way problem solved without using computer
One consideration must take account input output solution
The software could one three type Systems usually go several stage testing
Alpha testing first stage asmall group qualified individual examine early version program
Beta testing program fully featured released wider audience testing
Test data also used make sure program output expected data
We test program A new system implemented one following three way Proper maintenance system essential clear documentation begin help progress programmer need work hard understand design decision explained documentation
This reduces cost maintanence
Periodic review performance review use data collection technique seen analysis section indicate whether improvement modification needed

Sieglinde Fuller cost analysis LCCA method assessing total cost facility ownership
It take account cost acquiring owning disposing building building system
LCCA especially useful project alternative fulfill performance requirement differ respect initial cost operating cost compared order select one maximizes net saving
For example LCCA help determine whether incorporation may increase initial cost result dramatically reduced operating maintenance cost
LCCA useful budget allocation
Lowest cost LCC straightforward measure economic evaluation
Some commonly used measure Net Savings Net Benefits Ratio Savings Ratio Internal Rate Return Payback Period
They consistent Lowest LCC measure evaluation use parameter length study period
Building economist certified value specialist cost engineer architect quantity surveyor operation researcher others might use several technique evaluate project
The approach making choice project quite similar whether called
The purpose LCCA estimate overall cost project alternative select design ensures facility provide lowest overall cost ownership consistent quality
The LCCA performed early design process still chance refine design ensure reduction cost LCC
The first challenging task LCCA economic evaluation method determine economic effect alternative design building building system quantify effect express dollar amount
Viewed year period initial building cost account approximately total operation maintenance cost equal personnel cost equal
There numerous cost associated acquiring operating maintaining disposing building building system
cost usually fall following category Only cost within category relevant decision significant amount needed make valid investment decision
Costs relevant different one alternative compared another cost significant large enough make credible difference LCC project alternative
All cost entered amount today dollar LCCA method escalates amount future year occurrence discount back base date convert present value
Initial cost may include capital investment cost land acquisition construction renovation equipment needed operate facility
need included initial cost estimate differ among design alternative
This would case example comparing cost renovating existing facility new construction purchased land
Detailed estimate construction cost necessary preliminary economic analysis alternative building design system
Such estimate usually available design quite advanced opportunity design change missed
LCCA repeated throughout design process detailed cost information becomes available
Initially construction cost estimated reference historical data similar facility
Alternately determined government
The developed model different facility type determining critical cost parameter number floor area volume perimeter length relating value algebraic formula predict cost wide range building system subsystem assembly
Detailed cost estimate prepared submittal stage design typically based quantity calculation
These estimate rely cost database
Testing organization trade organization reference data material product test represent
Operational expense energy water utility based consumption current rate price projection
Because energy extent water consumption building configuration building envelope interdependent energy water cost usually assessed building whole rather individual building system component
Energy cost often difficult predict accurately design phase project
Assumptions must made use profile occupancy rate schedule impact energy consumption
At initial design stage data amount energy consumption building come engineering analysis computer program
require detailed input usually available later design process
Other software package proprietary program ESPRE EPRI developed assist mechanical equipment selection sizing often distributed manufacturer
When selecting program important consider whether need annual monthly hourly energy consumption figure whether program adequately track saving energy consumption design change different efficiency level simulated
Quotes current energy price local supplier take account rate type rate structure summer winter differential block rate demand charge obtain estimate close possible actual energy cost
Energy price assumed increase decrease rate different general price inflation
This differential energy price escalation need taken account estimating future energy cost
Energy price projection obtained either supplier energy price escalation rate published annually April DOE
Water cost handled much like energy cost
There usually two type water cost water usage cost water disposal cost
DOE publish water price projection
operating cost maintenance repair OM R cost often difficult estimate building expenditure
Operating schedule standard maintenance vary building building great variation cost even building type age
It therefore especially important use engineering judgment estimating cost
Supplier quote published estimating guide sometimes provide information maintenance repair cost
Some data estimation guide derive cost data report example average owning operating cost per square foot age building geographic location number story number square foot building
The give annualized cost building system element well service life estimate specific building component
The Army Corps Engineers Huntsville Division provides access customized OM R database military construction
The number timing capital replacement building system depend estimated life system length study period
Use source provide cost estimate initial investment obtain estimate replacement cost expected useful life
A good starting point estimating future replacement cost use cost base date
The LCCA method escalate amount future time occurrence
The residual value system component remaining value end study period time replaced study period
Residual value based value place resale value salvage value scrap value net selling conversion disposal cost
As rule thumb residual value system remaining useful life place calculated linearly prorating initial cost
For example system expected useful life year installed year end study period residual value would approximately initial cost
For federal project finance charge usually relevant
Finance charge payment apply however project financed
The finance charge usually included contract payment negotiated Energy Service Company ESCO utility
benefit cost effect objective way assigning dollar value
Examples effect may benefit derived particularly quiet HVAC system expected gain due improved lighting
By nature effect external LCCA significant considered final investment decision included project documentation
See
To formalize inclusion cost benefit decision making use analytical hierarchy process AHP one set decision analysis MADA method consider attribute qualitative quantitative addition common economic evaluation measure evaluating project alternative
published present procedure calculating interpreting AHP score project total overall desirability making capital investment decision
A source information estimating productivity cost example
In order able add compare cash flow incurred different time life cycle project made
To make cash flow LCC method convert present value discounting common point time usually base date
The interest rate used discounting rate reflects investor opportunity cost money time meaning investor want achieve return least high next best investment
Hence discount rate represents investor minimum acceptable rate return
The discount rate federal energy water conservation project determined annually federal project primarily concerned energy water conservation discount rate determined The Office Management Budget
These discount rate real discount rate including general rate inflation
The study period begin base date date cash flow discounted
The study period includes period service occupancy period
The study period alternative considered
The service period begin completed building occupied system taken service
This period operational cost benefit evaluated
In FEMP analysis service period limited year
The contract period ESPC UESC project lie within study period
It start project formally accepted energy saving begin accrue contract payment begin due
The contract period generally end loan paid
In OMB FEMP study annually recurring cash flow operational cost discounted end year incurred MILCON study discounted middle year
All single amount replacement cost residual value discounted date occurrence
An LCCA performed constant dollar current dollar
analysis exclude rate general inflation analysis include rate general inflation dollar amount discount rate price escalation rate
Both type calculation result identical cost
analysis recommended federal project except project financed private sector ESPC UESC
The method advantage requiring estimate rate inflation year study period
Alternative financing study usually performed current dollar analyst want compare contract payment actual operational energy cost saving year year
After identifying cost year amount discounting present value added arrive total cost alternative LCC I Repl Res E W OM R O LCC Total LCC PV dollar given alternative I PV investment cost incurred base date need discounted Repl PV capital replacement cost Res PV residual value resale value salvage value le disposal cost E PV energy cost W PV water cost OM R PV operating maintenance repair cost O PV cost contract cost ESPCs UESCs Supplementary measure economic evaluation Net Savings NS Ratio SIR Adjusted Internal Rate Return AIRR Simple Payback SPB Discounted Payback DPB
They sometimes needed meet specific regulatory requirement
For example FEMP LCC rule require use either SIR AIRR ranking independent project competing limited funding
Some federal program require Payback Period computed screening measure project evaluation
NS SIR AIRR consistent lowest LCC alternative computed applied correctly input value assumption
Payback measure either SPB DPB consistent LCCA calculated entire study period year payback period
All supplementary measure relative measure computed alternative relative base case
NS Net Savings operational saving le difference capital investment cost SIR Ratio ratio operational saving difference capital investment cost AIRR Adjusted Internal Rate Return annual yield alternative study period taking account reinvestment interim return discount rate SPB Simple Payback time required cumulative saving alternative recover initial investment cost accrued cost without taking account time value money DPB Discounted Payback time required cumulative saving alternative recover initial investment cost accrued cost taking account time value money Lowest LCC determining NS determining SIR ranking project AIRR discount rate ranking project SPB DPB study period screening project Decisions investment typically involve great deal uncertainty cost potential saving
Performing LCCA greatly increase likelihood choosing project save money long run
Yet may still uncertainty associated LCC result
LCCAs usually performed early design process estimate cost saving available rather certain dollar amount
Uncertainty input value mean actual outcome may differ estimated outcome
There technique estimating cost choosing wrong project alternative
Deterministic technique sensitivity analysis breakeven analysis easily done without requiring additional resource information
They produce estimate uncertain input data affect analysis outcome
Probabilistic technique hand quantify risk exposure deriving probability achieving different value economic worth probability distribution input value uncertain
However greater informational technical requirement deterministic technique
Whether one technique chosen depends factor size project importance resource available
Since sensitivity analysis analysis two approach simple perform part every LCCA
Sensitivity analysis technique recommended energy water conservation project FEMP
Sensitivity analysis useful To identify critical parameter arrive estimate upper lower bound answer question simply change value input holding others constant recalculate economic measure tested
sometimes want know maximum cost input allow project still break even conversely minimum benefit project produce still cover cost investment
To perform analysis benefit cost set equal variable specified variable solved algebraically
Sensitivity analysis analysis number approach risk uncertainty assessment deterministic probabilistic described detail Harold Marshall NIST Special Publication September
The use computer program considerably reduce time effort spent formulating LCCA performing computation documenting study
Listed several software program LCCA applied capital investment decision relatively higher initial cost traded reduced future cost obligation
It particularly suitable evaluation building design alternative satisfy required level building performance may different initial investment cost different operating maintenance repair cost possibly different life
LCCA provides significantly better assessment project alternative economic method focus first cost cost short run
LCCA among many design analysis tool used transform turn century building located downtown Tacoma WA energy efficient showcase building
LCCA performed various level complexity
Its scope might vary study detailed analysis thoroughly researched input data supplementary measure economic evaluation complex uncertainty assessment extensive documentation
The extensiveness effort tailored need project
applies analysis federal program policy primarily concerned energy water conservation renewable energy project
Appendix C Circular updated annually February provides OMB discount rate
FEMP published costing rule procedure
These FEMP rule consistent OMB rule
They followed federal agency unless specifically exempted evaluating potential energy water conservation project renewable energy project federally owned leased building

CNET Forum best source finding help troubleshooting getting community expert
Discussion topic include Intel AMD CPUs PC upgrade installing RAM hardware compatibility installing new hard drive custom build
I desktop computer since
The common thing seemed give first within year Power Supply I successfully replaced time recommended replacement
However seemed like unidentified component Motherboard also failed every one previous desktop computer
Not knowing enough computer hardware I took couple first one folk business repairing computer diagnosis possible repair
I found Power Supply After round computer I broke I decided get new one range donate broken one computer repairman gave repaired electronics charity
I many desktop one time never one year even though I work keep good condition like vacuuming inside ever month etc
I realize since BIC invented disposable lighter make sense buy new rather purchase fluid wick flint
And day cost le buy new digital camera get one repaired But Now also average desktop generally better buy new rather repair
Whether way day anyone know What Average life Average Desktop Computer
Average common brand name If asking technical help please sure include system info including operating system model number specific related problem
Also please exercise best judgment posting forum revealing personal information address telephone number address recommended
My experience would tend suggest year would typical PC
Even machine still working end year software OS upgrade
slowed crawl
In networked environment could consider VDI Terminal etc using thin client
The thin client outlast PCs hardware refresh limited server
Some thin client use little watt could helping fuel bill environment
With care usual moving part keeping fan vent clean find hard disk maker rate drive year design life
But desktop unlike laptop discus laptop life span desktop usually repaired le cost new desktop get well beyond year
Usable life however another story
If gamer lifespan appears year newest game tend want latest hardware
Bob The lifespan computer going vary
Depending often use computer use going factor equation
Also original equipment computer going play big factor
If buy computer typically getting dated hardware
Not used per se typically sold hardware generation behind newest hardware
And lower end machine obviously cheaper hardware
The cheaper hardware wo last long expensive hardware
The best way make sure get machine lot longevity consult local system builder
They able outfit machine quality component execellent life cycle
With good foundation hardware component able keep investment going strong many year come
The last desktop I bought
I also bought multifunction printer time
I still use day
Consult local IT profesional make next purchase get guidance need make sound technology investment
computer year use hour day
It could fail tomorrow could computer
Mine year old running strong although little slower new still usable
I replace want need
It going MIL soon use
I fully functional Atari run well first year existence
I start every year plop old cartridge marvel old game le mind intensive
The real reason new one IMHO want keep latest graphically orientated software usually requires better GPU GPU want compatible motherboard powersupply insufficient anyway
At point decide whether cost sort upgrade worth current computer
Its Graphics chip rule roost
The new bell whistle upgrade old tried perfectly function software originally graphic intensive become
And Games
I read somewhere lifespan harddrive average year
Get external one make primary
Most probably bigger came original purchase
Who know long last expected Game console
If want keep current game probably looking replacing upgrading machine every year game producer take advantage development graphic card processor
In machine hardware unlikely break short life
If machine use web surfing email Office type application probably need replace upgrade year
During time replacing component HDDs adding RAM maybe adding new optical drive often put strain power supply run hotter shorten life
Most commercial machine wo generous power supply keep eye anything add system
A self build run much longer I act internet gateway general machine anyone need
I built
Since new power supply couple additional HDDS RAM essentially machine
If go route though remember story lumberjack still original axe course new handle six new head axe
Many last longer maybe till something break
After four year many part manufacture begin discontinue part older PCs
Try look attempt replace motherboard RAM processor plus year old
No luck think dumpster diving
PC hardware develops fast rate guesstimate improvement year
If like waiting keep old system around long like
Do favor buy new one year
Agree
year If paid retail desktop I would give month something usually hard drive go
built cheap knockoff copied board
I building pc since first comodore would I wanted
LOL I always used quality name brand equipment bragging right type able sell cheaper retail still made decent profit
first personal lasted year still run fine win needed something faster
next lasted pretty much year cpu ram video card upgrade
still run fine still use add year
one I built almost year ago cause I wanted probably last
depends happens world personal want
I figure key longevity quality name brand equip getting like power supply larger really need
run thing max time well get heart attack
getting p larger doesnt work hard give max performance
With today cpu need keep cool add fan hight cfpm
least hard drive case one outside backup
hd really weakest link failure since high speed moveing part
last complete build I think ran plus new monitor LOL LOL full tower case one power supply one p run mobo ram vid card sat tuner card hd
The run diskett dvd fan
fan custom mounted give better flow thru etc
cut hole case side mount one directly cpu fan one side move air across bottom mobo
place air get past fan filtered
keep haveing vac place like I used
ONE THOUGHT lot electrical brown out power failure
could reason helped p go
I use spike line filtered pluged wall I plug APC UPS protection
lot power problem double shot keep sane
let cheaper strip eat
there two cent worth today
If want computer last really build
Otherwise know kind low quality component might use
Some tip
For longer working life tolerance heat buy motherboards solid capacitor
recognise easily squat tall

Buy RAM manufacturer run Memtest overnight make sure good

Buy power supply
If buy cheap nasty one give damage motherboard
This includes power supply come brand case
Okay solid capacitor motherboard cost twice much one without
RAM cost power supply also cost twice much cheap crud need go overboard watt
But end computer last last last safe knowledge everything computer The Good Stuff
Although I like reply best Very Good Advice I extend Thanks everyone joined subject With appreciation Charles Every one Apple Computers lasted I replaced due outdated sufficiently warrant replacement
They never hardware fault first immediate calved hard drive
Failing power supply mean cheapo component
There nothing inherent power supply say good three year
Using undersized poorly designed power capacitor usually issue
There secret chemical coating used cap manufacturer know electrolytic coating formula required obtained inventor patent holder I understand correct formula thousand premature failure result
Corporate espionage sometimes result perfect pay Unfortunately mean many people end junk PCs
Buy name brand unlikely repair fault
This course internet rumour seems case
If computer reputable brand ought last ten year
All mine date five year likely time upgrade due slow response modern software written faster machine graphic card
The power supply name brand computer built deliver double rated use
Cheap computer give enough time overheating component result premature failure might well take motherboard
Buy cheaper end
The best way Apple Mac Pro I know site I talking different crew
In case unaware Mac machine one run Windows Vista perfectly buy copy
It brainer install BMW quality hardware change
A good computer easliy last year without hardware repair
Be sure get computer
sound cheap serious computer though Best Buy desktop mail order
The power supply go bad time soon
I suspect buying cheap computer cheap PS
I suspect tech talked could find good fault gave stock answer
Were power supply back
These might gotten computer
The maintainance needed would blow inside NOT vaccuum
Get canned air blow dust computer warm usage
Maintain good
Get
progtam monitor HD though bear mind get sort ignorable warning
When say drive go get new HD immediatly
Use old one backup
If pet put computer fur wo get sucked
Finally one pet peeve I found Power Supply
That power supply apostrophe uncapitalized
A lot HP machine use noname power supply
I met lot people found PSU die year
They seem good enough survive beyond standard warranty much
Meanwhile I found anecdotally lot white box machine name brand PSUs seem last year
I enough data point speak authoritatively I think name outside computer important name component inside
In respect BYO white box build knowledgeable local vendor may much better choice reliability
Another slightly expensive option buy business model PC
They tend cost slightly expensive consumer edition version hardware tend use slightly higher quality component confidence quality hardware typically extends point better warranty business model well
Consumer hardware tends focus value rather reliability
Business user hand concerned performance gee whiz feature reliability
Business user still obviously want performance willing compromise reliability order get
I change everything hardware desktop monitor printer operating system
So I started XP Vista
Each time I bought hardware component typical generation capable running software
This way I keep everything compatible
I also go latest MS Office I make change right I using Office
Whatever current new system time
Usually five year small thing start getting flaky power supply DVDRW etc
I paid le Vista based HP system I XP based HP system
And I nice big inch LCD monitor tired old eye
I still running daily system I built
I first tried white box package dealer
My apartment building time aluminum wiring
This made computer unstable
I upgraded power supply Enermax watt effect
I went back dealer swap ASUS motherboard
All error stopped
I think lasted long onboard filtered power supply
It consistently among best performing board ARS Technica time
The change I made replace memory stick expired one Mushkin video card expired recently
It hard disk Samsung
I idea lasted long
I used ever since avoided issue reported first WinXP since Vista
I would love new system really much faster one I
My oldest computer lasted year PSU died recently year hardware excluding hard drive dvd burner around year
I diagnostics HSing Tech Motherboard Standard AT PSU check see part dead
I planning buy new power supply I actually get machine running
The motherboard ISA slot VLB video card
The hardware I installed WinBond Card ISA Sound Blaster PnP ISA Bahamas Paradise VLB Video Card AMD Processor memory Acer Widescreen LCD Monitor Logitech Keyboard hooked AT keyboard adapter
The PSU LSI AT PSU hard drive WDC Hard Drive Ontrack Dynamic Drive Overlay installed since Award BIOS support hard drive larger DVD Burner DVD RW
The one problem system turn POST video beep anything else except hard drive power DVD burner power heatsink fan turn PSU fan motherboard
I tested PSU see problem I believe much dust power supply board
Here spec HSing Tech Motherboard Logitech Keyboard Sound Blaster PnP ISA WinBond ISA Card Bahamas Paradise VLB Video Card LSI Standard AT PSU WDC Hard Drive Ontrack r Dynamic Disk Overlay Windows Data DVD RW DVD Burner Memory AMD Processor I tested PSU switch PSU thought I set voltage switch system power
I used voltage meter test connection wire connect voltage switch must bad wiring due aging brown out
This never occured computer I past today
As motherboard I tested connection PSU connects everything perfect
This PC sitting back room long time since got AMD computer lasted year Processor shorted motherboard fried
Does anyone know either motherboard dead PSU
I say average least year someone lucky old IBM XT PC
The desktop last much longer like exotic foreign car something go wrong difficult expensive fix supply matching part
But proper care includes keeping clean cool protecting power spike PC last year
Seriously dont vacuum tower PC wearing sweater inside case single power spike unless lightning wreck stuff constant fluctuation common especially circuit anything compressor eventually render hardware useless assuming software outdated
The problem unless bought top end machine right latest OS came system slow software become outdated incompatible year add extra year new OS machine
My advice always buy middle road machine unless serious gamer need advice year new OS come
Let someone else pay early adopter get performance price performance price
As long upgrade new machine every year always happy new machine even super fast much faster used
Of course figure put real power tablet landscape change
I one computer year fine slower towards end
I bought Dell Dimension afterwards still great year
I think buy good quality computer backup regular maintenance use computer year need advanced technology already using
Hey broke replace
However I think year computer might want consider upgrading get best quality
The key buy cheap computer quality make huge difference
In July I purchased HP Pavilion
I replace part yet knock wood still going strong
Many reply simply say depends use
I use mine little gaming little email little surfing etc forth
She still going strong
I three external hard drive thing I want save backup I need worry happen music movie picture die
Deciding retire desktop PC complicated depends long time using computer never give le four cheap machine also work approximately year
One best French door fridge tested A fridge useful feature like water pitcher FlexZone drawer
It performer cooling test

Manufacturing product complex
Raw material come many different source obtaining one material involves different series input output process impact environment
To identify total environmental impact product necessary life cycle analysis
To examine much product impact environment necessary account input output throughout life cycle product birth including design raw material extraction material production part production assembly use final disposal
The first stage life cycle analysis called inventory In inventory analysis goal examine input output product life cycle beginning product composed material came go input output related component material lifetime
It also necessary include input output product use whether product us electricity
The purpose inventory analysis quantify come go including energy material associated material extraction product manufacture assembly distribution use disposal environmental emission result
The next stage life cycle analysis impact analysis environmental impact identified previous stage enumerated environmental impact generating energy process hazardous waste emitted manufacturing process
Once environmental impact input output product lifecycle analyzed life cycle analysis generates number represents much environment affected
However major purpose analysis evaluate input output quantified product affect environment throughout lifecycle
Once general environmental impact calculated next step conduct improvement analysis see impact product environment
For example conservation energy water manufacturing process reduce environmental impact process
Substituting le hazardous chemical place toxic one would also reduce impact
The change made inventory analysis recalculate total environmental impact
Environmental health safety consultant Thomas Gloria compiled excellent list life cycle analysis link including list life cycle analysis software tool
Want know much metal used energy produced toxics transferred production car
This Carnegie Mellon Green Design Initiative calculator estimate overall environmental impact production various commodity service
In November article Beverly Hassell chemist American Chemical Society describes finding study published estimate environmental impact producing microchip
In analysis microchip scientist found amount fossil fuel chemical input necessary production significant negative impact air water soil
The EPA provides poster track CD DVD material acquisition reuse disposal

Contributing Writer Once upon time software development consisted programmer writing code solve problem automate procedure
Nowadays system big complex team architect analyst programmer tester user must work together create million line code drive enterprise
More To manage number system development life cycle SDLC model created waterfall fountain spiral build fix rapid prototyping incremental synchronize stabilize
The oldest best known waterfall sequence stage output stage becomes input next
These stage characterized divided different way including following The waterfall model well understood useful
In Information Center Quarterly article Larry Runge say SDLC work well automating activity clerk accountant
It work nearly well building system knowledge worker people help desk expert trying solve problem executive trying lead company Fortune
Another problem waterfall model assumes role user specifying requirement requirement specified advance
Unfortunately requirement grow change throughout process beyond calling considerable feedback iterative consultation
Thus many SDLC model developed
The fountain model recognizes although activity ca start others need design start coding considerable overlap activity throughout development cycle
The spiral model emphasizes need go back reiterate earlier stage number time project progress
It actually series short waterfall cycle producing early prototype representing part entire project
This approach help demonstrate proof concept early cycle accurately reflects disorderly even chaotic evolution technology
Build fix crudest method
Write code keep modifying customer happy
Without planning risky
In rapid prototyping sometimes called rapid application development model initial emphasis creating prototype look act like desired product order test usefulness
The prototype essential part requirement determination phase may created using tool different used final product
Once prototype approved discarded real software written
The incremental model divide product build section project created tested separately
This approach likely find error user requirement quickly since user feedback solicited stage code tested sooner written
The synchronize stabilize method combine advantage spiral model technology overseeing managing source code
This method allows many team work efficiently parallel
This approach defined David Yoffie Harvard University Michael Cusumano MIT
They studied Microsoft developed Internet Explorer Netscape Communications developed Communicator finding common thread way two company worked
For example company nightly compilation called build entire project bringing together current component
They established release date expended considerable effort stabilize code released
The company alpha release internal testing one beta release usually wider testing outside company finally release candidate leading gold master released manufacturing
At point release specification would frozen remaining time spent fixing bug
Both Microsoft Netscape managed million line code specification changed evolved time
Design review strategy session frequent everything documented
Both company built contingency time schedule release deadline got close chose scale back product feature rather let milestone date slip

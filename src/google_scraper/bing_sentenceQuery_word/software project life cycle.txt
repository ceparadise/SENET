Running Head Life Cycle Name Institution Professor Course Date Life Cycle Life Cycle Software Development Cycles Software development cycle rather process term used computer science refer series phase well step provide reliable model used develop manage lifecycle certain application
The methodology software development process may vary one organization industry another
However standard software development may remain across entire industry computer science
The standard represent process essential establishment lifecycle
Acquisition configuration development software system solely depend standard model Brewer Dittman
Some model used software development include waterfall model Agile model Spiral model incremental model well Prototype model
Each model follows certain life cycle process developing reliable software successful
However benefit associated SDLC Process
One benefit software development cycle help production product costefficient also effective better quality
There several stage involved SDLC Process include analysis training requirement design construction testing software release respond maintenance

What disadvantage living Age

Today people rely computer create store manage critical information
Thus important computer store accessible available needed also system work manner designed
That program designed way supposed
It also critical user take measure protect computer data loss damage misuse
Discuss position comment statement

Every phase Life Cycle SDLC nuance complexity
However final phase maintenance trickiest
By maintenance referring phase bug fixed improvement made
Typically software project activity account financial human resource
Why think might
To sure number reason
Should majority expense incurred actual development
Since maintenance take huge chunk resource software developed ease maintenance mind

A main driver completion project deadline sacrifice usually quality
Why ca company see pattern break away

If maintenance cost development would company best interest work greatest profit put resource preparation development phase
Do think company internally decide time analyze cost maintenance realize impact project

In large regard disadvantage living information age information overload
The amount information individual access daily basis astronomical
In large measure good
However dealing company business environment I believe thing start become impersonal work behind computer operate use email

Today people rely computer create store manage critical information
Thus important computer data store accessible available needed also system work manner designed
That program designed way supposed
It also critical user take measure protect computer data loss damage misuse
Discuss position comment statement
I believe statement correct
Having access appropriate information timely fashion critical
This particularly true since rely much information system job
One major
This solution discus concept pertaining Information Age

The software development life cycle SDLC framework defining task performed step software development process
SDLC structure followed development team within software organization
It consists detailed plan describing develop maintain replace specific software
The life cycle defines methodology improving quality software overall development process
The software development life cycle also known software development process
SDLC consists following activity There several software development model followed various organization Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

The system life cycle broken five stage Analysis Design Implementation Operation Maintenance
Gathering data essential analysis stage gain clear insight problem
If problem identified correctly poor solution guaranteed follow
A requirement specification contains system able done
This include A feasibility report produced analysis design stage
It include There number different way problem solved without using computer
One consideration must take account input output solution
The software could one three type Systems usually go several stage testing
Alpha testing first stage asmall group qualified individual examine early version program
Beta testing program fully featured released wider audience testing
Test data also used make sure program output expected data
We test program A new system implemented one following three way Proper maintenance system essential clear documentation begin help progress programmer need work hard understand design decision explained documentation
This reduces cost maintanence
Periodic review performance review use data collection technique seen analysis section indicate whether improvement modification needed

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue

Posted No field stress importance system quite like computer science
Effective computer system ensure logical workflow increase general efficiency make easier company deliver product client
The System Development Life Cycle process involves conceptualizing building implementing improving hardware software
The System Development Life Cycle must take consideration end user requirement security concern throughout phase
From banking gaming transportation healthcare System Development Life Cycle applicable field requires computerized system
Although numerous version interpretation System Development Life Cycle five commonly agreed upon phase characteristic
It important note maintaining strong communication end user client crucial throughout entire process
In first phase problem identified plan created
Elements phase include The importance Requirements phase overemphasized
Thorough planning save time money resource ensures rest System Development Life Cycle continues smoothly possible
Once developer reach understanding end user requirement actual product must developed
The phase considered one conceptual design may involve In phase physical design system take place
The Implementation phase broad encompassing effort designer end user
Elements include This phase may also include testing integration process ensuring entire system successfully work together single entity
Testing done real user trained personnel automated system becoming increasingly important process purpose customer satisfaction
Depending system question Implementation phase may take considerable amount time
Once system delivered go live requires continual monitoring updating ensure remains relevant useful
Requirements phase may include The Operations Maintenance phase continues indefinitely new problem discovered
If determined system must completely rebuilt Disposal phase begin
This phase represents end cycle system question longer useful needed relevant
In phase Security consideration aligned action
It must noted executing Disposal phase correctly crucial major error juncture put company risk exposing sensitive data
After Disposal phase System Development Life Cycle begin
The cycle usually conclusive end
Instead system generally evolve match improvement technology meet changing need
Sources For anyone considering job computer science System Development Life Cycle one many essential concept required know successful career

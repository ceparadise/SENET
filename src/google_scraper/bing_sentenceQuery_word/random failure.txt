Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

I trying build mathematical model availability file distributed
I posted question MathOverflow might well classified I give shot well
The system work like node store file encoed using erasure code remote node r b integer constant
file property file restored iff least b remote node available return part file
The simplest approach assume remote node independent availability With assumption availability file follows Binomial distribution
Unfortunately two assumption introduce error shown paper
One way overcome assumption node availability calculate probability possible combination node take sum outcome sort suggest paper formally I described
You see approach binary tree depth leave one possible combination node
The file availability thing probablity arrive leave available node
This approach correct computational cost
Also deal assumption node independence
Do guy idea good approximation introduces le error binomial better computational cost
You assume node set tuples consisting
With data could example calculate correlation availability node availability variance
For large use method called integration see
chapter SICP compute sum
For small significantly different probability exact method superior
The exact definition depend couple factor best tried experimentally
This basic sample code Python demonstrate procedure could work The function corresponds binomial test case run test checking node node alive probability failure
A experiment convince need value range thousand sample get reasonable result principle complexity
The accuracy result scale increase accuracy factor two need increase factor four
For sufficiently large method clearly superior
You obviously need design test case respect property system
You suggested couple extension easily implemented others
Let give couple suggestion In case distinct uncorrelated change code minimal In function head pas array instead single float replace line In case correlated need additional information system
The situation I referring comment could network like In case might root node failure node could imply automatic failure probability node failure node would automatically bring etc
At least case I referring comment plausible interpretation since talk tree structure probability original question
In situation would need modify code refers tree structure traverse tree skipping lower branch current node soon test fails
The resulting test still whether course
This approach fail network cyclic graph represented tree structure
In case need first create graph node either dead alive run routing algorithm graph count number unique reachable node
This wo increase algorithm obviously code complexity
Time dependence possible modification know since give probability either uncorrelated linear sum exponential
You run different time corresponding result
If merely log file hinted last paragraph require substantial modification approach beyond I board
The would need sufficiently thorough allow reconstruct model network graph thus graph well individual value node
Otherwise accuracy would unreliable
These would also need substantially longer failure repair assumption may realistic network
Assuming node constant known independent availability rate A divide conquer approach come mind
Say node
Step done recursively top level sum need find often number
I know complexity I guess I say The mechanic illustrated terminal case
Say node time
We split segment
We process find N node time segment For A For B The final result stage found multiplying summing appropriately

Learning compiler best way learn assembly since give computer scientist intuitive sense code transformed
Computer scientist understand generative programming macro lexical dynamic scope closure continuation function dynamic dispatch subtyping module functors monad semantic concept distinct specific syntax
Computer scientist must solid grasp formal logic proof
Proof algebraic manipulation natural deduction engages reasoning common routine programming task
Proof induction engages reasoning used construction recursive function
Computer scientist must fluent formal mathematical notation reasoning rigorously basic discrete structure set tuples sequence function power set
For computer scientist important cover reasoning Students learn enough number theory study implement common cryptographic protocol
Students certainly see common rare yet unreasonably effective data structure algorithm
But important knowing specific algorithm data structure usually easy enough look computer scientist must understand design algorithm greedy dynamic strategy span gap algorithm ideal implementation
At minimum computer scientist seeking stable employment know following Computer scientist ready implement extend algorithm operates data structure including ability search element add element remove element
For completeness computer scientist know imperative functional version algorithm
A grasp theory prerequisite research graduate school
Theory invaluable provides hard boundary problem provides mean circumventing initially appear hard boundary
Computational complexity legitimately claim one truly predictive theory computer science
A computer scientist know boundary tractability computability lie
To ignore limit invite frustration best case failure worst
At undergraduate level theory cover least model computation computational complexity
Models computation cover automaton regular language regular expression pushdown automaton language formal grammar Turing machine lambda calculus undecidability
At undergraduate level student learn least enough complexity understand difference P NP
To avoid leaving wrong impression student solve large problem NP reduction SAT use modern SAT solver
There substitute solid understanding computer architecture
Computer scientist understand computer transistor
The understanding architecture encompass standard level abstraction transistor gate adder muxes flip flop ALUs control unit cache RAM
An understanding GPU model computing important foreseeable future
A good understanding cache bus hardware memory management essential achieving good performance modern system
To get good grasp machine architecture student design simulate small CPU
Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes operating system
As computer scientist aware kernel handle system call paging scheduling filesystems internal resource management
A good understanding operating system secondary understanding compiler architecture achieving performance
Understanding operating system I would interpret liberally include runtime system becomes especially important programming embedded system without one

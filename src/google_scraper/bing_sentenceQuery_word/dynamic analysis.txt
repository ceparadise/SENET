performed executing program real virtual processor
For dynamic program analysis effective target program must executed sufficient test input produce interesting behavior
Use measure help ensure adequate slice program set possible behavior observed
Also care must taken minimize effect instrumentation execution including temporal property target program
Inadequate testing lead catastrophic failure similar maiden flight rocket launcher dynamic execution error resulted destruction vehicle
Dynamic analysis contrast
use dynamic testing
Most use dynamic program analysis technique

In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

Because analyst also heavily involved business side company may helpful take business course major management information system
Some employer prefer applicant master degree business administration MBA concentration information system
For technically complex job master degree computer science may appropriate
Although many computer system analyst technical degree degree always requirement
Many analyst liberal art degree gained programming technical expertise elsewhere
Many system analyst continue take class throughout career learn new innovative technology
Technological advance come rapidly computer field continual study necessary remain competitive
Systems analyst must understand business field working
For example hospital may want analyst thorough understanding health plan program Medicare Medicaid analyst working bank may need understand finance
Having knowledge industry help system analyst communicate manager determine role information technology IT system organization
With experience system analyst advance project manager lead team analyst
Some eventually become IT director chief technology officer
For information see profile
Analysts must interpret complex information various source decide best way move forward project
They must also figure change may affect project
Analysts work management IT department must explain complex issue way understand
Because analyst tasked finding innovative solution computer problem ability think outside box important

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
This question already answer The dynamic programming algorithm time complexity O nW n number item W capacity knapsack
Why algorithm
I read one need W bit represent W exponential time
But I understand one also need n bit represent n one
So example polynomial time complexity O n one need n represent n
What I missing
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
When say polynomial exponential mean polynomial exponential
nW polynomial n W
However usually consider running time algorithm function
This argument W come
Ignoring value item moment considering weight input knapsack problem n number W
Each number represented W bit n number size instance W
This make nW polynomial size instance since W exponential W
However coming back example sorting instance sorting consists n element sorted representing take least n bit probably bit since element probably bigger bit
We represent n using n bit ca represent n thing using n bit
The main difference W represents number input n represents number thing
Note cheat could represent W using W bit used unary encoding
This version problem technically polynomial really deliberately le efficient
It turn whole class still even input represented unary format
But Knapsack one problem
I read one need represent W
But I understand also one need represent n
This great question
You need look input actually
The input consists n item weight value plus capacity W knapsack
Each w W number written binary
In particular must least one bit length input least n bit well even bit
You absolutely correct take n bit write n binary W bit write W
But point n written binary part input

In language term often used define contains data code defines behavior signature
A code data method corresponding interface said interface
Furthermore class implement multiple interface hence different type time
An interface thus definition anywhere object exchanged example call object exchanged defined term interface rather specifying particular
This approach mean class implement interface used
For example may used allow development progress final implementation available
In another case implementation may substituted testing
Such implementation replaced real code later development process
Usually method defined interface contains code thus called must implemented code run invoked
An interface called might define two method
It implemented different way example first fast working stack fixed size second using data structure resized cost somewhat lower speed
Though interface contain many method may contain one even none
For example language defines interface single method various implementation used different purpose including

I searched definition API programming language I still finding hard understand
Could anyone advice simple layman term Searches include Wikipedia number programming An application programming interface API particular set
It serf interface different software program facilitates interaction similar way user interface facilitates interaction human computer
The way set rule used
Depends upon realm API naturally
Consider Happy coding
An API interface access someone el code someone else code access
In effect public method property
API contract
A promise perform described service asked specific way
According rule specified contract
The whole point API define used
It used separate system need work together achieve something ca alone
Well In addition answer I adding example
As Others Said
Note human interaction
An example You buying item online credit card
You provide credit card detail press continue button
It tell whether information correct
To provide result lot thing background
The application send credit card detail remote application validate information send result back application
API used scenario
I think hope help beginner understand really API
Weather application Weather application must open site read detail human
Weather application send message receives result display
Various online resource API Application Programming Interface set defined function method interfacing underlying operating system another program service running computer
It usually used establishing reference library software importing function dll
It used one form another almost software explicitly called program implicitly called compiler
API stand Application Programming Interface
API way application interact certain
For example API OS WinAPI API application like database specific library example image processing etc
APIs usually developed form consumable client application
For application set header file library
For Java set jar
And
It set software component interact one another
It provides set function variable object class creation application operating system thing
In layman term I always said API like translator two people speak different language
In software data consumed distributed using API translator two different kind software communicate
Good software strong translator API follows rule protocol security data cleanliness
I Marketer coder
This might quite right I tried express year An API set command function protocol programmer use building software specific OS software
The API allows programmer use predefined function interact operating system instead writing scratch
All computer operating system Windows Unix Mac OS language Java provide application program interface programmer
An API defines interface one piece software communicates another source level
It provides abstraction providing standard set interface usually function one piece software typically piece invoke another piece software usually piece
For example API might abstract concept drawing text screen family function provide everything needed draw text
The API merely defines interface piece software actually provides API known implementation API
It common call API contract
This correct least legal sense term API agreement
The API user generally software zero input API implementation
It may use API use take leave
A example API interface defined C standard implemented standard C library
This API defines family basic essential function memory management string manipulation routine
Conaider situation Mark Lisa secretly couple age difference allowed together
Mark Lisa meet every night nobody watching
They estabilished set rule comunicate time come
He stand garden throw small rock window
Lisa know time responds waving window opening afterwards Mark climb
That example API work
The rock initial request another end
Another end wave open window basicaly mean Welcome
API almost like human language computer
Lets say developing game want game user login facebook profile get profile information playing game going access facebook
Now come already written program API use program game use service good detailed look API set routine protocol tool building software application
An API specifies software component interact APIs used programming graphical user interface GUI component
A good API make easier develop program providing building block
A programmer put block together
source My personal experience might help understand APIs
I difficulty beginning learning programming grasp abstraction
A Wikipedia article could help
But experiencing concrete example APIs make easier understand abstraction
I would appreiate hear help

The field space interaction human machine occur
The goal interaction allow effective operation control machine human end whilst machine simultaneously feed back information aid operator process
Examples broad concept user interface include interactive aspect computer hand operator control control
The design consideration applicable creating user interface related involve discipline
Generally goal produce user interface make easy efficient enjoyable operate machine way produce desired result
This generally mean operator need provide minimal input achieve desired output also machine minimizes undesired output human
With increased use relative decline societal awareness heavy machinery term user interface generally assumed mean industrial control panel machinery control design discussion commonly refer interface
Other term user interface machine question computer
The user interface part machine handle interaction
Membrane switch rubber keypad touchscreen example physical part Human Machine Interface see touch
In complex system interface typically computerized
The term refers kind system
In context computing term typically extends well software dedicated control physical element used
The engineering interface enhanced considering
The corresponding discipline HFE UE part
Tools used incorporating human factor interface design developed based knowledge
Nowadays use expression interface computer nearly using graphic
There difference user interface operator interface interface HMI
In HMI sometimes used refer better described
However latter usage seeing increasing application use medical artificial extension replaces missing body part
In circumstance computer might observe user react according action without specific command
A mean tracking part body required sensor noting position head direction gaze used experimentally
This particularly relevant
The history user interface divided following phase according dominant type user interface In batch era computing power extremely scarce expensive
User interface rudimentary
Users accommodate computer rather way around user interface considered overhead software designed keep processor maximum utilization little overhead possible
The input side user interface batch machine mainly equivalent medium like
The output side added medium
With limited exception system human being interact batch machine real time
Submitting job batch machine involved first preparing deck punched card describing program dataset
Punching program card done computer specialized machine notoriously bulky unforgiving prone mechanical failure
The software interface similarly unforgiving strict syntax meant parsed smallest possible compiler interpreter
Once card punched one would drop job queue wait
Eventually
operator would feed deck computer perhaps mounting supply another dataset helper software
The job would generate printout containing final result often abort notice attached error log
Successful run might also write result magnetic tape generate data card used later computation
The single job often spanned entire day
If one lucky might hour response unheard
But worse fate card queue computer actually required even tedious process toggling program binary code using console switch
The earliest machine actually partly rewired incorporate program logic using device known
Early batch system gave currently running job entire computer program deck tape include would think code talk device whatever housekeeping needed
Midway batch period various group began experiment system
These used always resident computer
Programs could call monitor service
Another function monitor better error checking submitted job catching error earlier intelligently generating useful feedback user
Thus monitor represented first step towards operating system explicitly designed user interface
CLIs evolved batch monitor connected system console
Their interaction model series transaction request expressed textual command specialized vocabulary
Latency far lower batch system dropping day hour second
Accordingly system allowed user change mind later stage transaction response feedback earlier result
Software could exploratory interactive way possible
But interface still placed relatively heavy mnemonic load user requiring serious investment effort learning time master
The earliest system combined computer adapting mature technology proven effective mediating transfer information wire human being
Teleprinters originally invented device automatic telegraph transmission reception history going back already become newsroom elsewhere
In reusing economy certainly consideration psychology mattered well teleprinter provided point interface system familiar many engineer user
The widespread adoption terminal VDTs ushered second phase system
These cut latency character could thrown phosphor dot screen quickly printer head carriage move
They helped quell conservative resistance interactive programming cutting ink paper consumables cost picture first TV generation late even iconic comfortable teleprinter computer pioneer
Just importantly existence accessible screen display text could rapidly reversibly modified made economical software designer deploy interface could described visual rather textual
The pioneering application kind computer game text editor close descendant earliest specimen still live part tradition
In beginning IBM created called SAA standard include CUA derivative
CUA successfully created know use today Windows recent DOS Windows Console Applications use standard well
This defined pulldown menu system top screen status bar bottom shortcut key stay common functionality Open example would work application followed SAA standard
This greatly helped speed user could learn application caught quick became industry standard
Primary method used interface design include prototyping simulation
Typical interface design consists following stage interaction specification interface software specification prototyping All great interface share eight quality characteristic The POLA general principle design kind interface
It based idea human being pay full attention one thing one time leading conclusion novelty minimized
If interface used persistently user unavoidably develop using interface
The designer role thus characterized ensuring user form good habit
If designer experienced interface similarly develop habit often make unconscious assumption regarding user interact interface

What mean saying something Ready
Depends coming
If vendor generally mean We tested environment anywhere near large complex crossing finger hoping scale requirement
If come IT department generally mean We tested much qa environment completely blow
We would like test production environment please Enterprise Ready interpretation lie far experienced project claim marketing lingo saying software robust enough deployed large environment hundred thousand hundred thousand user
This also includes ability support large user base software disrupt business long event something right
Ultimately I think buzz word provide entry market large corporation increase cost associated product
Normally mean expensive
On serious note There industry standard definition phrase
For money used marketer impress easily impressed
Typically mean following Also often mean support hotline call thing break
In hardware often enterprise consumer class
With consumer buy store may get person hotline call
With enterprise normally buy though partner normally get support contract
So end expensive unless really large company like Google make OS hardware better paying getting enterprise class normally enterprise grade RMA option SLA Apart one mentioned Enterprise Ready also mean By posting answer agree

defined body knowledge principle practice design whole part enterprise
An enterprise complex system comprises interdependent resource people information technology must interact environment support common mission
According Kosanke Vernadat Zelm enterprise engineering supported enterprise modelling
Enterprise engineering subdiscipline
The discipline examines aspect enterprise including business process information flow material flow organizational structure
Enterprise engineering may focus design enterprise whole design integration certain business component
In theory practice type enterprise engineering emerged
In field general form enterprise engineering emerged
Encompassing application knowledge principle discipline related analysis design implementation operation element associated enterprise
In essence combine seek engineer entire enterprise term
field related
In context specific field enterprise engineering also appeared deal modelling integration various organizational technical part function
In context information system development become area activity organization extension existing scope
It also viewed extension generalization system analysis phase
Here enterprise modelling form part early middle late
Explicit representation organizational technical system infrastructure developed order understand orderly transformation existing work practice
This discipline also known along Enterprise ontology defined one two major Enterprise architecture
Enterprise engineering involves formal methodology method technique designed tested used extensively order offer organization reusable business process solution These methodology technique method le suited modeling enterprise underlying process
provides template interconnected modeling construct encode business people information technology IT aspect enterprise requirement
This done multiple perspective Information view Function view Resource view Organization view
These construct used structure facilitate design implementation detailed IT system
The division different view make clarifying reference enterprise software engineer
It show information need different enterprise function activity process operation alongside corresponding resource
In way easily determined IT system fulfill information need particular activity associated process
first developed model manufacturing system used Airforce since originally offered four different notation model enterprise certain viewpoint
These functional data dynamic process analysis respectively
Over past decade number tool technique integration different notation developed incrementally
IDEF show business process flow variety decomposed business function corresponding information input output actor
Like CIMOSA also us different enterprise view
Moreover IDEF easily transformed development IT system
These positive characteristic make powerful method development Functional Software Architectures
Petri Nets established tool used model manufacturing system
They highly expressive provide good formalism modeling
The advantageous property ability create simple representation state concurrent system transition capability thereby allowing modelling duration transition
As result Petri Nets used model certain business process corresponding state transition activity therein well output
Moreover Petri Nets used model different software system transition system
In way programmer use schematic coding reference
In recent year research shown Petri Nets contribute development business process integration
One Model Blue methodology developed Chinese Research Laboratory
Model Blue outline importance model driven business integration emerging approach building integrated software platform
The correspondence Model Blue business view equivalent Petri Net also shown indicates research closed gap business IT
However instead Petri Nets researcher instead use Model Blue IT view derived business view transformation engine
UML broadly accepted modeling language development software system application
Many within community also use UML enterprise modeling purpose
Here emphasis placed usage enterprise object business object complex enterprise system made
A collection object corresponding interaction represent complex business system process
While Petri Nets focus interaction state object UML focus business object
Sometimes called enterprise building block includes resource process goal rule metamodels
Despite fact UML used model integrated software system argued reality business modeled software modeling language
In response object oriented community make business extension UML adapts language accordingly
EEML derived UML proposed business modeling language
The question remains whether business transformation correct method use earlier said UML combination pure business method may better alternative
EFD used modeling technique representation enterprise function corresponding interaction
Different business process modeled representation use function module trigger
A starting business process delivers different input different function
A process flowing function creates multiple output
Enterprise Function Diagrams thereby provide detailed representation business process corresponding function input output trigger
In way EFD many similarity diagram also represent business process hierarchical fashion combination function trigger
The two differ EFD place business function organization hierarchical perspective outline downstream certain process organization
On hand diagram show responsibility certain business function use arrow
Furthermore provides clear representation input output every sub function
EFD may used business software modeling language like UML major similarity IDEF modeling tool indicate indeed possible
However research needed improve EFD technique way formal mapping UML made
Research complementary use IDEF UML contributed acceptance IDEF end therefore similar study carried EFD UML

Those reservation gradually evaporating however advantage cloud become apparent
There much hype around social medium important add ERP system
Certainly vendor quick seize initiative adding social medium package ERP system much fanfare
But wonder really much gain integrating social medium ERP
Enterprises attempted build ERP system take care every aspect organizational system
But expensive failure gradually brought change strategy adopting two tier ERP
Depending organization size need number enterprise resource planning software vendor choose large enterprise small business ERP market
Gartner annual market share report put SAP Oracle Sage Microsoft NetSuite among top vendor Capterra data suggests SAP Oracle easily biggest two Epicor Infor Microsoft heel shifting
The top small business ERP vendor includes name like NetSuite Exact Max Epicor Syspro

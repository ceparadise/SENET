art science planning leading software project
It project planned implemented monitored controlled
In software industry grew quickly computer company quickly recognized relatively low cost software production compared hardware production circuitry
To manage new development effort company applied established project management method project test run especially confusion occurred gray zone user specification delivered software
To able avoid problem project management method focused matching user requirement delivered product method known
As industry matured analysis software project management failure shown following common cause The first five item list show difficulty articulating need client way proper resource deliver proper project goal
Specific useful often necessary true art software project management applying correct method using tool support method
Without method tool worthless
Since several proprietary software project management method developed software manufacturer use computer consulting firm also developed similar method client
Today software project management method still evolving current trend lead away waterfall model cyclic project delivery model imitates software development process
A concerned primarily production aspect opposed technical aspect

Many software development process run similar way general project management process
Examples The purpose identify scope project involved create
Project planning begin define software developed
The developed describe lead completion
The purpose project monitoring control keep team management date project progress
If project deviate plan project manager take action correct problem
Project monitoring control involves status meeting gather status team
When change need made used keep product date
In computing term issue unit work accomplish improvement system
An issue could bug requested feature task missing forth
For example used call modified version IssueZilla
As September call system Issue Tracker
The word issue also used synonym problem English usage
Problems occur time time fixing timely fashion essential achieve correctness system avoid delayed delivery product
Issues often categorized term
Different company different definition severity common one In many software company issue often investigated verify system correctness assigned developer responsible resolving

One critical factor project success project plan
This article provides approach creating project plan showing provides roadmap project manager follow also exploring project manager premier communication control tool throughout project

One misunderstood term project management project plan set living document expected change life project
Like roadmap provides direction project
And like traveler project manager need set course project project management term mean creating project plan
Just driver may encounter road construction new route final destination project manager may need correct project course well
A common misconception plan equates project timeline one many component plan
The project plan major work product entire planning process contains planning document project
Typically many project key stakeholder affected project project end result fully understand nature project plan
Since one important difficult aspect project management getting commitment buying first step explain planning process project plan key stakeholder
It essential understand importance set document familiar content since asked review approve document pertain
Baselines sometimes called performance measure performance entire project measured
They project three approved starting point include scope schedule cost baseline
These provide ground
That used determine whether project track execution project
These plan include documentation variance baseline handled throughout project
Each project baseline need reviewed managed
A result process may include need additional planning possibility baseline change
Project management plan document project team variance baseline occur including process followed notified change funded etc
Other work product planning process
These include risk management plan quality plan procurement plan staffing plan communication plan
Not key stakeholder review document necessary determine project need approve part plan
Some key player
The kickoff meeting effective way bring stakeholder together discus project
It effective way initiate planning process

It basis getting agreement sponsor stakeholder decrease chance miscommunication
This document likely grow change life project
The Scope Statement include It treated like contract project manager sponsor one changed sponsor approval

Once deliverable confirmed Scope Statement need developed work breakdown structure WBS decomposition deliverable project
This deliverable WBS form scope baseline element The WBS often thought task breakdown activity task separate breakdown identified next step

Here step involved developing schedule cost baseline
This process effort
Throughout project likely adding repeating step

Once scope schedule cost baseline established create step team take manage variance plan
All management plan usually include review approval process modifying baseline
Different approval level usually needed different type change
In addition new request result change scope schedule budget process needed study new request determine impact project

The staffing plan chart show time period usually month quarter year resource come onto leave project
It similar project management chart like Gantt chart show task estimate begin end date critical path
It show time period resource length time resource expected remain project

Project quality consists ensuring end product meet customer specification one sponsor key business expert actually want use
The emphasis project quality preventing error rather inspecting product end project eliminating error
Project quality also recognizes quality management responsibility need performed throughout project

When project charter created initiating process group contains summary scope budget summary milestone schedule
Since already thing time begin developing project plan go ahead develop scope management plan cost management plan schedule management plan

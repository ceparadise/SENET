Search Entity UK US Search Entity rest Computing Students

A basic unit used computer science
Nodes device data point larger network
Devices personal computer cell phone printer node
When defining node internet node anything
Nodes individual part larger data structure
Nodes contain also may link node
Links node often implemented
Nodes often arranged tree structure
These structure
A node represents information contained single structure
These node may contain value condition possibly serve another independent data structure
Nodes represented single parent node
The highest point tree structure called root node parent node serf parent node tree
The height node determined total number edge path node furthest leaf node height tree equal height root node
Node depth determined distance particular node root node
The root node said depth zero
Data discovered along network path
An IP address us kind system node define location network
Another common use node tree
In programming used communicate information computer programmer computer alike
For reason XML used create common used serf base development modern web like
Though similar approached programmer typically language used develop website text design
While XML HTML XHTML provide language expression serf translator
Different type node tree represented specific interface
In word node type defined communicates node
Each node node type property specifies type node sibling leaf
For example node type property constant property node property specifies type node
So node type property constant node one know node object object Element
This object us Element interface define method property particular node
Node Types Different node type description A node object represented single node tree
It element node attribute node text node type described section node type
All object inherit property method dealing parent child node object parent child node
For example text node child node similar node add child node result error
Objects DOM tree may addressed manipulated using method object
The public interface DOM specified API
The history Document Object Model intertwined history late well first widely implemented

Relational database allow data separated connected across several table
Tables connected primary foreign key increase efficiency
The main characteristic When working relational database user need try keep
Each entity primary key provide unique reference entity mean entity referenced another table without call detail entity
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip

Databases mysterious critical technology
Here one simple way describe kid adult
Databases solve critical problem computing store information
Many adult idea database work problem designed solve
This article show one way describe database younger kid
First adult describe database encyclopedia A database stored file set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken record consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although database applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Still reading
Most adult find difficult understand typical definition database
The day I overheard someone say friend Well would describe database year old Then laughed
Apparently difficult problem
Here I would describe database young kid age
First problem database solve one image Second solution also one image Every person know need bucket cabinet store toy
Otherwise toy take floor apartment house one get outside
Databases solve problem organize stuff data case database make easy find later
In way kid parent sort toy database also sort data reason
Sorting make easier find stuff later
Every parent suffered child find favorite toy place different toy
Databases solve problem computer
Here little complexity want
The common database would store toy piece
It might make sense example create second box inside toy box database store head doll another box store arm
That type database called relational database keep track arm head go relate doll
But newer type database let keep doll one piece
That kind database called database
Why break doll piece
In case make finding stuff database faster
Imagine need keep track many company multiple office location
It might easiest database table company name another table office location contact information
Toys different
Breaking doll piece help u find Fluffy toy box
So next time child game onscreen ask think information go play game
If score think game keep track score
If move one part game another game keep track
Almost always answer database
Technically might file stored game device data sorted stored file similar bigger database
But get picture

These problem procedure data space program representing procedure particular programming language computer
Problems procedure often confused
A problem defined criterion determines whether proposed solution accepted
One understand problem completely without method solution
Procedures usually built elementary procedure
What elementary procedure may complex procedure constructed one first topic computer science
This subject hard understand since precise notion computable function guide u computability relative given collection initial function easy define
Procedures operate member certain data space produce member data space using general still data space intermediate
A number operation known constructing new data space simpler one yet general theory representable data space comparable theory computable function
Some result given
Programs symbolic expression representing procedure
The procedure may represented different program different programming language
We shall discus problem defining programming language semantically stating procedure program represent
As syntax programming language rule allow u determine whether expression belongs language formalized part syntax relate closely semantics well studied
The problem translating procedure one programming language another much studied shall try give definition correctness translation
Computers finite automaton
From point view computer defined effect executing program given input state memory output
Computer science must study various way element data space represented memory computer procedure represented computer program
From point view current work automaton theory beside point

How teach kid programming computer science much learning code
Most people quit
Here idea link help answer question
In past year I published magazine first year common question people asked Where I child begin learn code Or How I teach kid programming computer science My answer variation It It depends whether child adult parent teacher
It also depends learning code answer
Learning comfortable technology learning technology work learning technology help hurt u individually society answer question Where I begin learn code Writing publishing magazine taught vast majority people start coding quit
They get bored
Or coding hard
Or coding really fit thing
For example coding requires lot problem solving skill turn requires balance rigid step step process intuition based experience
Not everybody like combination
From start magazine published article based guideline developed Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA If learn lot topic give coding never learn code understand technology work technology appropriate
If learn code terrific
However learning code helpful required technology literate
With prologue specific answer question Where I begin learn code If kid year old especially younger sibling might want start game toy teach programming concept
For example Robot Turtles great board game neat extension like online community create game board
These game sometimes let replace object direct game person like child parent adding another level fun engagement
In style Move Turtle phone application let kid basic programming
Kids adult give direction move turtle make turtle thing
Each step corresponds programming activity specify action detail action example move action forward way screen detail action
There also robot like KIBO robot developed Tufts University geared kid age
KIBO Kickstarter looking mass market technology
Kids almost age also might appreciate Computer Science Unplugged computational thinking project
Like board game project teach computer science programming concept without computer
If kid comfortable game like Robot Turtles CS Unplugged activity might try next project coding aspect
Robots like Sphero make easy direct cute little robot ball around room graduate programming robot
Computational thinking project also project basic programming Python useful advanced project
From simple use coding kid also gravitate programming language geared towards kid education language like Python
For example least one ebook online teach basic Python kid
They learn small bit language importantly learn programming concept
Languages geared towards kid tend use Logo language kid enter basic direction avatar often turtle follows direction screen use block language like Scratch Alice Tynker several others
These language make easy kid focus language le specific syntax
In contrast adult use programming language syntax structure critical bit code slightly le important
When kid might start beginning board game programmable robot language geared towards education
But also might dive language like PHP Python JavaScript part reading online finding neat project trying replicate project computer
They also might love game learn modify game get coding
I used web browser View Source menu example learn HTML CSS JavaScript million people year ago
Technology everywhere number way older kid latch learn
While parent might mixed feeling kid lost hour video game game lead programming
Minecraft put Raspberry Pi computer designed help kid get hardware software project
Skyrim game make somewhat easy older kid research code modification make game even fun
I also highly recommend find local programming group like Coder Dojo kid adult work together computing project
It structured way relax fun technology engaging people
Technology social activity strictly solo
You also learn sharing debating
And I would encourage parent kid look online resource geared towards teacher teach computer science programming
Often resource like Minecraft Education parent use get kid started kid explore
Bottomline though true subject important start kid adult place find comfortable provide tool explore find way
Programming computer science fascinating absorbing
But discover
A teacher parent ca force enthralled concept making computer something
What I found interesting publishing magazine many teacher want learn programming computer science much student
There lot energy fun ingenuity going teaching computer science coding classroom
Even better fad
Teachers get connection math taught kid generation example math used computing
Teachers also get need guideline online behavior another critical skill want technology literate
What applies kid adult also applies teacher many option learn computer programming computer science
It important holistic focus strictly learning skill
It important kid well rounded view technology love gadget healthy respect work might might fit society
While teacher might enjoy board game Robot Turtles might work great kindergarten first grade classroom Computer Science Unplugged project project geared towards time constraint classroom well laser focus one topic project
If student graduate programming tool like Scratch Alice Tynker Codea Minecraft like great kid project within single class period period time
There many resource online help distill programming language education project kid handle easily
Finally Skype classroom great example technology teacher kid use connect teacher classroom
You learn programming necessarily
But teacher student expand horizon learn lot world engage people would never meet otherwise
As I noted start biggest lesson learned first year publishing magazine coding answer
The answer exposure technology computer science programming
Most people never code
Yet learn enough programming realize phone tablet computer device magical
They tool created human being like
And tool limitation benefit
Tools extremely fun use
It also true group charged creating programming computer science curriculum treat programming one aspect curriculum
While lot hype outside classroom everyone must learn code people charged creating curriculum student take holistic broader view
I want thank reader subscriber great first year publishing magazine
I started Help Kids Code way explore computer science coding meet write people really neat stuff
It fun ride
I look forward second year
To give Americans particular general idea country teach programming computer science
Tim writer technologist enjoys teaching tech people
He many year experience web site application business technical creative role
He wife two kid teenager mad video game
Codea app designed make easy create game software
Here tutorial link online resource
Here quick introduction Raspberry Pi find one get set sort neat project
With link step
Summer great time get outdoors learn technology meet people summer tech camp local tech group
Github important tool used programmer manage code project
Here Github tutorial link learn
It fun easy create ASCII art computer keyboard text editor imagination

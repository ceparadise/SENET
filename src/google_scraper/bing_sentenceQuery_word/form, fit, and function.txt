Form fit function commonly discussed relation design object considering process value added
Engineers pay close attention form fit function design whether initial inception change happen throughout product life cycle
Companies strong tend product design change others person company tends assume role traditionally filled manufacturing engineer
Specifically make frequent recommendation product process change make production better
Think like engineer making change
Look new design affect form fit function consider change mean customer
As rule even change make production process easier change perception customer eye
For example make washing machine might easier cheaper weld cover position
But would make repair road much expensive difficult typical
The fit product need owner specifically low lifetime cost ownership reduced
Form fit function also good litmus test check step value added
If step change form fit function product probably value added
Tightening bolt hold part together applying paint example step change form fit function
A customer value Fs follows step would something customer would willing pay
But step change likely added
It may still necessary
moving part receiving dock production area still something customer would like see invoice

For example cat paw human hand similar bone designed function much differently
The phrase form follows function derived famous saying skyscraper architect Louis Sullivan whose exact word form ever follows function
This particularly useful idea biologist see structure function go hand hand especially come cell disruption one aspect lead failure another

principle associated century
The principle shape building object primarily based upon intended function purpose
The American architect coined phrase although authorship phrase often wrongly ascribed American sculptor whose thinking large extent predates later approach architecture
Greenough writing long time largely forgotten rediscovered selection essay published title
Sullivan Greenough much younger compatriot admired rationalist thinker like Greenough coined phrase article fifty year Greenough death though Sullivan later attributed core idea architect engineer author first asserted book structure must exhibit three quality firmitas utilitas venustas must solid useful beautiful
Here Sullivan actually said form ever follows function simpler le emphatic phrase one usually remembered
For Sullivan distilled wisdom aesthetic credo single rule shall permit exception
The full quote thus Whether sweeping eagle flight open toiling blithe swan branching oak winding stream base drifting cloud coursing sun law
Where function change form change
The granite rock hill remain age lightning life come shape dy twinkling
It pervading law thing organic inorganic thing physical metaphysical thing human thing superhuman true manifestation head heart soul life recognizable expression Sullivan developed shape tall steel late Century moment technology taste economic force converged made necessary drop established style past
If shape building going chosen old pattern book something determine form according Sullivan going purpose building
It form follows function opposed form follows precedent
Sullivan assistant adopted professed principle slightly different shaking old style gave freedom latitude
In Austrian architect wrote allegorical essay titled reaction excessive invented ornament used architect
Modernists adopted Loos moralistic argument well Sullivan maxim form follows function
Loos worked carpenter USA
He celebrated efficient plumbing industrial artifact like corn silo steel water tower example functional design
phrase became Modernist architect
The credo taken imply decorative element architect call ornament superfluous modern building
However Sullivan neither thought designed along line peak career
Indeed building could spare crisp principal mass often punctuated plain surface eruption lush something like decoration usually cast iron terra cotta ranging organic form like vine ivy geometric design interlace inspired Irish design heritage
Probably famous example writhing green ironwork cover entrance canopy South State Street Chicago
These ornament often executed talented younger draftsman Sullivan employ would eventually become Sullivan trade mark student architecture signature
One episode history inherent conflict functional design demand marketplace happened introduction streamlined American auto industry temporarily halted attempt introduce optimal aerodynamic form mass manufacture
Some car maker thought aerodynamic efficiency would result single optimal shape teardrop shape would good unit sale
GM thereafter adopted two different position streamlining one meant internal engineering community meant customer
Like annual model year change aerodynamic styling often meaningless term technical performance
Subsequently become marketing tool mean improving car reducing fuel consumption slightly increasing top speed markedly
The American industrial designer like grappled inherent contradiction form follows function redesigned blender locomotive duplicating machine consumption
Loewy formulated principle express product design bounded functional constraint math material logic acceptance constrained social expectation
His advice new technology made familiar possible familiar technology made surprising
By honestly applying form follows function industrial designer potential put client business
Some simple object like screwdriver pencil teapot might reducible single optimal form precluding
Some object made durable would prevent sale replacement
From standpoint functionality product simply unnecessary
died influential recent designer design philosopher taught wrote proponent form follows function
It argued structure internal quality attribute working software artifact represent first foremost engineering requirement construction influence process marginal
This mean process irrelevant process compatible artifact requirement lead roughly similar result
The principle also applied Enterprise Application Architectures modern business function Business process assisted enterprise architecture form
If architecture dictate business operates business likely suffer inflexibility unable adapt change
SOA enables rearrange form architecture meet functional requirement business adopting standard based communication protocol enable interoperability
Furthermore postulate structure emerge constraint modeled domain
While form function may le explicit invariant concept many engineering doctrine paradigm lend well explore blur invert essence two concept
The movement espouses technique driven development engineer begin minimum unit user oriented functionality creates automated test implement functionality iterates repeating process
The result argument discipline structure emerges actual function fact done organically make project adaptable long term well higher quality functional base automated test
If design automobile conforms function instance shape partly due desire sit six people two row form said follow function
According anatomy structured according function associated use instance taller reach leaf
By contrast form function determined
That say Lamarckian evolution form altered required function whereas Darwinian evolution small variation form allow part population function better therefore successful reproductively

In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

The Research Paper Factory In Form Function The relationship Form Function central study biology
George Cuvier father comparative anatomy laid theory correlation part similarly appearing anatomical structure similar function similarity used group diagnose organism structure

Cloud Form Fit Function defined following An example Fit Form Function analysis socket mount relay might follows In EPRI document Table provides general listing typical critical characteristic
The three main category listed Product Identification Physical Performance Characteristics
The useful product identifier mean unique part number permanent identification nameplate
A unique part number provides traceability performance specification
When nameplate possible sealed packaging labeling becomes primary mean component identification
The nameplate packaging unique part number required handling inventory quality control process product
There standard recommended practice part number identification
One extreme part number specific information detailing component
For example connector designated military standard specifies among thing material dimension pin orientation
Another vendor may select part number
A part number inherent specification would require supporting literature determine component property
An important feature part number documentation revision level item

Table also list general physical performance characteristic used technical evaluation process
Table provides list additional characteristic may used part analysis process
It good practice review many characteristic possible determine relationship exists
For example Table Crimped Terminal Connector characteristic color
Although color typical characteristic motor may contractual specification paint
The replacement colored push button may industry standard associated required operation
By evaluating many characteristic possible contractual requirement standard relationship may discovered
The analysis characteristic consider application operational design intent characteristic
EPRI document Table includes list characteristic relate application
Tables provide starting point critical technical characteristic FFF analysis
In general addition evaluate item based table engineering investigation also include specific contractual requirement reliability analysis industry code published standard manufacturing quality process
Once critical characteristic determined supplier commercial grade item CGI must provide objective quality evidence ensure purchased item conform original manufacturer specification acceptable level variance
Each alternative item technical analysis summary
Probably challenging supplying replacement component electronics
Recently large number product changed comply European RoHS Directive
RoHS stand Restriction use certain Hazardous Substances electrical electronic equipment
Many manufacturer discontinued product support new RoHS compliant unit
The change RoHS compliant product includes change product identification
The change identification must documented
Here example Fit Form Function analysis computer mouse RoHS compliant
Item Computer mouse
Fit Electrical connection identical
Function The number switch operation identical
Form The internal assembly identical exception unit manufactured without hazardous material
A written explanation would explain difference would change performance device
The electronic industry significant manufacturing consolidation
Although product line may still active manufacturer name might changed
This change might change method specification component identification
A replacement component may readily available change manufacturing component identification would require clarification
With use selling site eBay obsolete component may available supplier
Although CGI may original box supplier lack traceability quality standard may used
For longer available option evaluate parent assembly supplied
For example replacement computer system component current product may difficult
The processor backplane memory card interface card power supply may longer available
Individually would difficult replace
Evaluating governing assembly possible replacement may found entire computer system
Functional capability direct replacement area open interpretation
If device requires technical setup configuration may fit definition direct replacement
In example statement capable operation software installed
Application software specific facility would installed computer system
In typical direct replacement handled FFF analysis requirement additional technical labor may issue disclosed analysis item
Another type CGI might require technical assistance would device servo motor amplifier
At initial installation device adjustment physically marked recorded part final step installation
Replacement device requires technical setup includes performance adjustment calibration
If FFF analysis determined location range setting adjustment setting would exact copy direct replacement would possible
A field installation setup process would required
In addition maintaining operation existing level possible enhance plant operating reliability level
In cooperation regular maintenance program replacement component supplied exceed original specification
A replacement item could meet original specification current industry standard
Industry testing requirement may revised case made obsolete
The analysis replacement electrical cable might find FFF feature follows There also exist discrepancy due thing typographical error
Over last year transposing handwritten bill material computer based data record resulted occasional confusion
Suppliers vendor converting different MRP data base also resulting part number change
Historical record engineering change documentation product purchase history shipping information may used clarifying hardware item due documentation error
Vendors factory representative may substitute CGI without traceability
The supplier may recommend replacement
If FFF analysis confirms acceptable replacement purchase order must amended reflect change component supplied

Today people need know computer work
Most people simply turn computer mobile phone point little graphical object display click button swipe finger two computer something
An example would get weather information net display
How interact computer program average person need know
But since going learn write computer program need know little bit computer work
Your job instruct computer thing
Basically writing computer program involves describing involves authoring
Computer programming involves developing list instruction representation software The stuff instruction manipulate different type object number word image sound etc
Creating computer program like composing music like designing house like creating lot stuff
It argued current state engineering
A fair question may An important reason consider learning concept underlying valuable regardless whether go make career
One thing learn quickly computer dumb obedient
It exactly tell necessarily wanted
Programming help learn importance clarity expression
blog post elaborates many reason learning computer programming important
One final reason lot fun
A said I believe I paid well something I love
So instruction computer understands look like
And kind object instruction manipulate
By end lesson able answer question
But first try write program English language
Remember I said Introduction lesson
Before see computer programming language look like let use English language describe something series step
A common exercise really get thinking computer programming like describe process familiar
Rather write version exercise I searched Internet word computer programming sandwich using
One hit returned
At link Deb Sweeney Tamaqua Area Middle School Tamaqua PA described problem When exercise directed experienced teacher mentor excellent demonstrating careful need detailed need writing computer program
Programming natural language say full scope English language seems like difficult task
But moving language write program today I want leave high note
A little le fifteen year ago friend introduced programming environment called
It provides new approach teaching computer programming graphical user interface eliminates possibilty making certain mistake common programming
Programs constructed connecting block representing functionality available system
Figure show simple program asks person running name say hello
Color used category block belong
Notice block corresponding block shade blue
The shape block determine placed form acceptable program
The rounded green block fit rounded hole violet block
One Scratch strength ease student construct game animated simulation story
Another strength provides access many tutorial community user program written
To learn Scratch visit
programming great way get started
But size program want write grows need feature available Scratch time switch programming
Almost computer programming day done programming language
There lot quite old
COBOL FORTRAN Lisp devised
As see language make easier describe piece program creating
They help letting concentrate trying rather represent specific computer architecture
They away specific microprocessor computer
And language come large set common stuff need called library
In introduction work two computer programming language Logo Java
Logo come Bolt Beranek Newman BBN Massachusetts Institute Technology MIT
scientist MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory helped BBN design Logo
More research use educational setting exists programming language
Java fairly recent programming language
It appeared Internet starting get lot attention
Java invented James Gosling working Sun Microsystems
It language
One big advantage learning Java lot software already written help write program elaborate graphical user interface communicate Internet
You get take advantage software thousand programmer already written
Java used variety application mobile phone massive Internet data manipulation
You get work window object Internet connection object database access object thousand others
Java language used write apps
So lesson start Logo programming language
No computer programming language depth research Logo based use educational setting
It root development interactive learning environment
Wally Feurzeig researching use timeshared computer improve teaching mathematical concept BBN Bolt Beranek Newman
The question wanted answer whether kid would embrace new technology learn using
With success demonstrated using existing programming language Wally contracted Seymour Papert help Logo design
Seymour wrote functional specification Logo
wrote first Logo interpreter
Since early day hundred book research paper written use classroom
started MIT Logo Group Papert put together comprehensive website Logo
I like using Logo language teach introductory programming easy learn
The faster get write interesting computer program fun
And fun important
But let Logo simplicity fool thinking programming language
Logo derivative Lisp programming language powerful language still used today tackle advanced research performed
show power Logo series book
cover six computer science topic Logo
Both Logo Java sort stuff needed write computer program
Each ability manipulate object example arithmetic function working number
Each let compare object variety thing depending outcome comparison
Most importantly let define procedure
Named procedure list instruction named procedure
The abstraction naming stuff let write program language define
This stuff programming really see
Just give feel programming like language program greets u pretending know English
This one simplest program written language
Logo When performed take whatever follows display
The Hello world program famous
In addition command Logo output sort result
Although bit contrived program display product constant number ten random number range zero fourteen
In source code command input output operator
multiplies whatever follows whatever follows output result
So need two input
operator output number greater equal zero le number following
So get second input output
Figure show graphical representation procedure fit together
Do worry get detail Logo operator
Finally snipet advanced Logo source code give feeling look like
This procedure definition selecting maximum number list number
Again worry understand exactly procedure work
It writing anything like
But I want see word make program instruction instruction similar English sentence first line half procedure similar sentence So programming language like English one step closer language computer really understands look like
Now let move computer native language look like given symbolic representation
One abstract layer computer native language assembler language
In assembler language everything given symbolic name
The programmer work operation microprocessor know given symbolic name
Objects microprocessor address stuff computer memory also given meaningful name
This actually big step computer understands still tedious writing large program
Assembler language instruction still place little snipits software need interact directly microprocessor executed many many many time
Table example DEC assembler language function return largest integer group named NUMARY
The group contains NUMNUM member
Hopefully give feel primitive computer instruction set
I going go detail every instruction
If want go detail
A point I want expose general kind thing done
So seen programming language provide similar functionality form closer English language
But problem assembler language unique every computer architecture
Although deskside notebook computer day use Intel architecture recently case
And variety computer architecture commonly used game system smart phone tablet automobile appliance etc Ok almost point I show machine language language computer
But understand I going explain everything represented computer
Basically computer instruction perform operation group bit
A bit either like lightbulb
Figure show open switch lightbulb like transistor computer represents bit value zero
Figure show switch closed position lightbulb like transistor computer representing bit value one
A microprocessor heart computer primitive fast
It take group bit move around content add pair group bit together subtracts one group bit another compare pair group etc sort stuff
Inside microprocessor low level everything simply bunch switch also known bit thing either
Time expand done first let explore group bit used form number
Computers full zillion bit either
The way talk value bit electical engineering computer science community first logical value secondly bit
Most bit computer manipulated group human need way describe group bit computer manipulates
Today bit often grouped quantity
Think write sequential number starting zero etc Our decimal number system ten symbol
In sequential series ran symbol combined
You learned long ago grade school today naturally think term single digit number ten hundred thousand etc
The decimal number one thousand two hundred three ten four unit
So used inside computer work
Well two symbol would write sequential number
The decimal number binary
Since even reasonable number use time make long binary number bit grouped simple convert number octal hexadecimal number system
For octal group three bit together
Take binary equivilent decimal put space group three bit starting right going left
Now use symbol eight symbol OCTAL replace group
The octal representation binary pattern certainly easier read write remember binary counterpart
An even compact representation achieved grouping bit chunk four converting hexNumerals
When group four bit together use sixteen symbol A B C D E F abbreviation hexadecimal representation
As continue explore computer work hear number expressed octal hex manageable representation binary information
Table compare decimal binary octal hexadecimal number system
So common grouping bit computer kind number group represent
A group eight bit binary value expressed decimal
A group sixteen bit binary value decimal
I going type binary representation group bit
The range decimal value group bit
The range decimal value group bit
But wait number positive Whole Numbers
If going allow subtraction operation number result negative number need Integers
Modern computer use one bit group represent sign positive negative group used represent integer
show range number represented group bit
That deep I want get representation number computer binary octal hexadecimal number system
Yes computer division operator I going cover number include fractional part number due complexity implementation
If want read I googled found look like good place read
Start read continue web page series
start section point Wikipedia page also give additional depth including history binary number system
Ok number simply group bit
What object computer instruction manipulate
How symbol make alphabet
It come surprise symbol make alphabet number group bit
But know number used represent symbol character I going call point
It standard
In lesson use American Standard Code Information Interchange ASCII standard
It ubiquious even web page
Let walk couple example entry table
Here character decimal value binary value transformed octal number
Table small slice full ASCII character set enough give flavor organization
Here little trivia day long past computer slow compared today
Take moment see understand explanation binary number

The image computer display actually digital stuff consists bunch colored point called pixel
A pixel object
It color position coordinate consists row column
Figure show artist rendition magnification display circle drawn yellow
The tiny black dot pixel big yellow dot pixel colored
As example display thin vertical line color value column pixel set desired color line
If want thicker vertical line set color value pixel group consecutive column desired color
Figure show red line single pixel wide orange line three pixel wide
The orange line actually thin rectangle
So location pixel obviously specified pair number pixel color
Well pixel color also specified number three called RGB Red Green Blue value
Play following JavaScript program let see number value generate color
What color get set red green blue
What RGB value favorite color
So group bit represent number symbol used form pixel
Ok
I exposed variety object commonly see using computer thing manipulated instruction computer programming language
Now let move computer instruction one thing bunch bit
So computer bit
You seen used represent stuff pixel number character
I mentioned computer perform operation bit like move around add pair together etc One final obvious question instruction computer performs represented
Well instructed computer native language machine language would write instruction form yes
This VERY hard
Although pioneer computer science one day
Just give something look compare Table show assembler language program could look like assuming machine instruction loaded memory address
Also group number start memory address size group memory address
A detailed explanation computer instruction set beyond presented
I wanted see symbolic information assembler language program need converted number bit computer perform
If really want detail
The lesson walk programming simple robot computer
And I wrote simulator Robot Computer jLogo play HERE
No introduction computer programming would complete without least mentioning
The term refers discovery correction mistake computer program
The computer instructed meant
If enjoy puzzle good chance find process debugging interesting challenge
The origin term came bug moth found relay computer
She found program working
Debugging process
The good news u mistake introductory level program hard diagnose fix
It basically narrowing instruction two intended
Steps take like solving puzzle
Debugging program done step match
In observation step think hard happening versus expected happening
An example program drawing something jumble line see display look right
Or program button anything click
As programmer approach bug like legendary Sherlock Holmes approached case
Review program written ask question like How could instruction produce happening
Observation lead point make hypothesis bad behavior
For drawing coming right hypothesis might something like If computing metric orientation length first line might produce I seeing
For button working hypothesis could If mouse location clicked computed wrong program ignore click
The hypothesis made often based intuition
This usually person debugging either wrote program least modified
Given hypothesis next step figure test predicting happen hypothesis correct
Continuing example misbehaving drawing program let say notice source code might produce proper result given bound expected
This code could produce strange result
This prediction
Finally either program modified debugging feature programming environment used test prediction
Modification program addition instruction print stuff display
Most programming environment include debugging feature like setting breakpoints suspend program examine internal state
Either way programmer gather information program actually case bug expect
Testing even provide answer get additional information used repeat process
You narrow exploration find mistake
Ok since reading accessing web page net Google take fraction second answer question
From Computer programming something source code representation algorithm great detail
Since computer understand English would impossible human write large program series binary number computer understand need something
programming language currently fit category
Given programming language chosen follow rule composing statement expression instruct computer want
Because computer simply fast manipulator bit one zero power abstraction computer scientist layered level object representation functionality one top another
We working refining extending layer half century
Table give feel stand computer programming language today
In next lesson start write program Logo
created game popular moment teach power two binary number system side effect
But beware game tagged addictive

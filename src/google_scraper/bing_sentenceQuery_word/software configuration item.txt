I expected see SRS SDD ICD SVD SIP document acceptance test documentation subsystem As far I tell CSCI defined logic HWCI Hardware Configuration Item simply defined CSCI configuration item
More clear definition superseded CSCI An aggregation software satisfies end use function designated separate configuration management acquirer
CSCIs selected based tradeoff among software function size host target computer developer support concept plan reuse criticality interface consideration need separately documented controlled factor
I think would make sense map CSCI deliverable application

SOFTWARE IN PRACTICE Definition Email page friend A component system treated self contained unit purpose identification
All configuration item CIs uniquely identified CI registration code version number
A CI may primitive system building block
code module aggregate CIs
aggregate software unit
The figure depicts underground railway environmental control system
The system central operation control centre many railway station
Each station For purpose example let look configuration item identified remote terminal unit control software
The RTU three component managed unit purpose identification change control These three component identified primitive level configuration item decomposed managed unit
For example logic file loaded RTU unique identifier version number
The RTU example aggregate configuration item
An RTU CI release aggregate firmware configuration logic CIs
The station CI another aggregate configuration item
A station CI release aggregate individual LCP RTU IBP CI release
The choice aggregate primitive level configuration item driven way development operation maintenance system managed
For example station CI selected configuration control item useful one revision identifier indicates control system component location
The revision level assigned station CI denotes level functionality available possible mode communication operation control centre

The term refers fundamental structural unit configuration management system
Examples CIs include individual document software model plan
The system oversees life CIs combination process tool implementing enabling fundamental element identification status accounting audit
This system aim avoid introduction error related lack testing well incompatibility CIs
CIs used manufacturing sector scope include configuration
Even though CIs mandatory domain version management essential
The term configuration item applied anything designated application element configuration management treated single entity system
A versioned entity may consist several configuration item
The set change configuration item appear note may contain specific heading configuration item
A complex hardware configuration item may many level configuration item beneath top level configuration item level must meet fundamental element configuration management system
In addition purpose implementation management change configuration item listing definition act common vocabulary across group connected product

In task tracking controlling change software part larger field
SCM practice include establishment
If something go wrong SCM determine changed changed
If configuration working well SCM determine replicate across many host
The acronym SCM also expanded
However configuration generally understood cover change typically made
The goal SCM generally With introduction purpose SCM tool become merged case
The SCM tool become virtual appliance instantiated virtual machine saved state version
The tool model manage virtual resource including virtual appliance storage unit software bundle
The role responsibility actor become merged well developer able dynamically instantiate virtual server related resource
The history software configuration management SCM computing traced back early CM Configuration Management originally hardware development production control applied software development
Early software physical footprint medium
The first software configuration management manual operation
With advance language complexity involving configuration management method became major concern due issue like schedule budget quality
Practical lesson year led definition establishment procedure tool
Eventually tool became system manage software change
practice offered solution either open proprietary manner
With growing use computer system emerged handled broader scope including design alternative quality control later tool followed guideline organization Capability Maturity Model

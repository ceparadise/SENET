Estimating duration lengthy process take time long term project
Ideally involve core project team estimating duration depending duration develop schedule milestone project
So understand important derive duration project
The estimating duration project phase product phase somehow iterative nature
It changed work progress new activity identified project
Initially estimate project based network diagram sequencing activity modified based change done project execution controlling monitoring process
In estimating duration else involved
You involve project team work project achieve project objective project management team identified key stakeholder make consensus milestone date delivery schedule know develop schedule estimating duration project
This important methodology get entire duration estimation
Based information past project similar nature derive idea entire duration estimation
Is easy
You get information Project Management Office use template current project
It accurate nature
But time le costly le time consuming well
You frequently use sufficient time take decision earliest
Analogous estimating part project well like estimate entire project
It single phase project requirement phase similar previous processed project
It accurate nature
It based statistical calculation historical data variable
Such design phase case construction project cutting stone take hour
So understand accurate
If project similar nature performed past best process get estimation duration
It estimation based unitary calculation historical data past project
This estimating based considering various option like assignment resource uncertainty risk associated best scenario based worst scenario based
Three point estimating concept originated PERT Program Evaluation Review Technique
Through PERT generally estimate three type duration viz
Most Likely M Optimistic O Pessimistic P
Out Most Likely M based resource assigned Optimistic O based best scenario based analysis
And last one Pessimistic P based worst possible scenario based analysis
Then take help useful formula deriving expected duration
They follows Here expected time Optimistic Most Likely Pessimistic duration respectively
In way understand importance PERT estimating duration project
It also known Rule Thumb
You roughly guess entire design phase take entire project time useful case known phase put imaginary figure based experience
It type contingency reserve
After fixing schedule activity level depending activity attribute put contingency reserve timing adding percentage derived schedule activity
It changed work progress
It reduced increased depending situation front

One first mistake new project manager make carrying assume must estimate activity duration task
This called guessing
Put simply every activity three attribute duration work effort resource
The secret estimate work effort first resource finally able estimate activity duration
Estimating activity duration straight bat bit like determining price meal deciding want eat want eat
The Estimate activity duration process within PMBOK analyze activity estimate long take see depend amount work required within activity many resource assigned activity resource available
You notice sequence within time management process group first define activity estimate activity resource go estimate activity duration
This main input ensures every identified activity included duration estimated These always accompany activity list provide extra information activity number resource needed activity
Activity resource requirement
This main output estimate activity resource process includes kind resource number along reason led choice It worth mentioning resource human facility material tool equipment
Human resource standard working hour hence constrained availability
As example task requires hour work estimate activity duration based number people carry hour work factored calendar availability
This defined created within define scope process includes assumption constraint bearing estimating activity duration
As example scope statement may identify particular activity needing subcontracted due specialist nature skill required would assist obtaining accurate using estimate activity duration process
These may take several form main one consist historical information previous similar Estimate activity duration
These asset may also consist information work culture within organization typical working pattern overtime shift working
The nature environment project large impact time take carry certain task
If task taking place oil rig stringent safety standard difficulty carrying activity middle ocean hazardous condition would bearing Estimate activity duration
This course main output process
Do assume activity one estimate many technique tool helping give range estimate task
I develop idea discussing tool

As result carrying estimate important capture assumption made example skill knowledge experience required
It likely therefore activity attribute need updated
There used Estimate activity duration This us estimate previous similar project basis estimating activity within one
These previous estimate arrived using expert judgement amount similarity previous project current activity factored
Suppose family go camping holiday first time
You practice directing tent backyard establish take minute
Knowing direct tent halfway mountain temperature lower strong wind present factor estimate take minute
Analogous estimating also known estimating
Using individual performed similar activity powerful way obtain realistic achievable estimate
The knowledge skill experience gained improve accuracy estimate
Indeed without knowledge activity estimate would best simple guess
Expert judgement best implemented parallel organisational process asset consideration activity environmental factor
Put simply linear extrapolation hence best applied activity easily scaled
A prerequisite using parametric estimating must therefore experience similar previous activity available
Suppose take engineer hour configure notebook PC
If personal computer need configured take hour work
If realistic assume engineer configure personal computer every day take five day configure computer
Put another way five engineer similar knowledge skill experience could configure personal computer one day
This approach used risk management may also called contingency
This must confused term padding would infer adding fat estimate
The approach consider risk may occur carrying particular activity impact risk would activity completion
Examples risk might rework error technical difficulty resource availability etc
Based risk analysis contingent amount would added activity
For example reworked risk likely outcome determined extra hour work would result either resource would added activity duration increased extra day
The risk management ongoing activity throughout project important therefore reserve analysis time addition reviewed throughout project revised appropriate information gathered throughout life project
This technique also known PERT project evaluation review technique estimate
If one estimate used task high probability estimate turn slightly higher lower reality
But suppose seeking estimate asked three estimate instead one
The approach ask pessimistic worst case estimate realistic almost likely case estimate optimistic best case estimate
You may wish use work hour carrying technique convert duration
Alternatively may use technique directly duration day The three estimate stated replied formula produce weighted average three result single realistic estimate task duration
Another formula remember standard deviation estimate standard deviation pessimistic optimistic Using simple example let assume following estimate obtained This would result following estimate Applying standard deviation merely factor spread estimate give rough guide confidence estimate lower value better

You new project team created good activity list brainstorming session led
Now need estimate duration activity determine meet deadline established project customer
What
While want aggressive schedule know make customer happy miss final delivery date
At time conservative want tell customer meet deadline lose project
In effort create realistic duration start looking prior experience similar project
You use actual completion duration activity team performed company team performed similar completed project
When prior experience available gather appropriate team member brainstorm estimated activity duration based expert judgment
In case estimating tool may available
Once determined estimated duration activity need create network diagram display relationship activity calculate overall duration project
In general two approach creating network diagram activity arrow AOA activity node AON
The useful getting display relationship activity limited use analyzing overall project duration
The activity arrow approach place activity duration line connecting related activity project
The relationship displayed network diagram show activity connected activity activity precede come succeed follow
When get relationship displayed correctly estimated duration calculate overall duration project based following path project
The longest duration path network diagram represents critical path
The sometimes called similar development activity arrow diagram except activity associated duration displayed node rather arrow
point arrow intersect
Because placing activity associated duration node typically box space box include additional information
As analyze path moving forward AON diagram add information box indicates earliest activity start earliest finish
Again longest path network diagram critical path
With AON diagram result critical path analyze path project working backward critical path finish
When working backward project activity indicate latest activity finish node determine latest date activity start
When know late start date activity better determine actual status project
Thus overall schedule impacted activity miss late start date
Get FREE access day create account
To create meaningful project schedule estimated duration activity must realistic
Realistic duration estimate determined using actual completion duration similar previously completed project expert judgment team member case estimate
Once realistic estimate project activity duration developed display activity associated duration network diagram
There two type network diagram activity arrow AOA activity node AON
The display activity duration line arrow
The line connected show activity activity preceding succeeding activity
By analyzing path diagram project critical path overall duration determined
The robust managing project provides additional schedule analysis activity duration placed box node arrow
By analyzing activity moving forward diagram determine earliest start finish date activity
When find critical path use finish date critical path work backward schedule calculate latest start finish date activity
Knowing allows better determine effect overall project activity miss last start date

The set project activity
It commonly used conjunction
The critical path method CPM project modeling technique developed late Morgan Walker James Kelley
Kelley Walker related memory development CPM
Kelley attributed term critical path developer developed time
The precursor came known Critical Path developed put practice DuPont contributed success
CPM commonly used form project including construction aerospace defense software development research project product development engineering plant maintenance among others
Any project interdependent activity apply method mathematical analysis
The first time CPM used major skyscraper development constructing former World Trade Center Twin Towers NYC
Although original CPM program approach longer used term generally applied approach used analyze project network logic diagram
The essential technique using CPM construct model project includes following Using value CPM calculates planned activity logical end point end project earliest latest activity start finish without making project longer
This process determines activity critical longest path total float delayed without making project longer
In project management critical path sequence project network activity add longest overall duration regardless longest duration float
This determines shortest time possible complete project
There float unused time within critical path
For example project testing solar panel requires could scheduling constraint testing activity would start scheduled time sunrise
This might insert dead time total float schedule activity path prior sunrise due needing wait event
This path total float would actually make path longer total float part shortest possible duration overall project
In word individual task critical path prior constraint might able delayed without elongating critical path float task
However time added project duration constraint actually amount project duration extended critical path activity constraint
A project several parallel near critical path task could float float
An additional parallel path network total duration shorter critical path called path
Activities path drag extending project duration
CPM analysis tool allow user select logical end point project quickly identify longest series dependent activity longest path
These tool display critical path near critical path activity desired cascading waterfall flow project start current status date selected logical end point
Although diagram still used place generally superseded diagram activity shown box node arrow represent logical relationship going predecessor successor shown diagram
In diagram Activities A B C D E comprise critical longest path Activities F G H critical path float day day day respectively
Whereas activity critical path float therefore delaying completion project critical path usually critical path drag delay project completion
The drag critical path activity computed using following formula These result including drag computation allow manager prioritize activity effective management project completion shorten planned critical path project pruning critical path activity fast tracking performing activity parallel crashing critical path shortening duration critical path activity adding
Critical path drag analysis also used optimize schedule process outside strict context increase manufacturing throughput using technique metric identify alleviate delaying factor thus reduce assembly lead time
term referring shortest possible time activity scheduled
It achieved shifting resource towards completion activity resulting decreased time spent often reduced quality work premium set speed
Crash duration typically modeled linear relationship cost activity duration however many case convex function step function applicable
Originally critical path method considered logical terminal element
Since expanded allow inclusion resource related activity process called resource assignment
A schedule may include delay due resource bottleneck unavailability resource required time may cause previously shorter path become longest resource critical path
A related concept called attempt protect activity project duration unforeseen delay due resource constraint
Since project schedule change regular basis CPM allows continuous monitoring schedule allows track critical activity alert project manager possibility activity may delayed beyond total float thus creating new critical path delaying project completion
In addition method easily incorporate concept stochastic prediction using PERT
Currently several software solution available industry use CPM method scheduling see
The method currently used project management software based manual calculation approach developed Fondahl Stanford University
A schedule generated using critical path technique often realized precisely used calculate time one mistake made result analysis may change
This could cause upset implementation project estimate blindly believed change addressed promptly
However structure critical path analysis variance original schedule caused change measured impact either adjusted
Indeed important element project postmortem analysis ABCP analyzes specific cause impact change planned schedule eventual schedule actually implemented

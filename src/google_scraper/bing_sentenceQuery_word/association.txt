You complete around credit hour course earn associate degree
Much coursework fulfill general education requirement probably include math English composition social science humanity course
After completing general education course fulfill concentration take elective preferred area study
The number required course course distribution vary school check adviser school determine exact requirement
When enter general associate degree science program may want select concentration
Depending interest goal could choose computer science physic biology engineering chemistry health science
Some program specialized dental hygiene emergency medical service nursing although many case offered Associate Applied Science degree
These specialized program often take longer complete allow transfer bachelor degree program find job upon graduation
Although could enter science program school without first earning AS degree attending community college offer several advantage
You could cut educational cost receive personal attention smaller class build academic success better chance acceptance school
Even decide pursue bachelor degree completing AS degree still meet improved career outlook

information processing divided individual indivisible operation called
Each transaction must succeed complete unit never partially complete
For example purchase book online bookstore exchange money form credit book
If credit good series related operation ensures get book bookstore get money
However single operation series fails exchange entire exchange fails
You get book bookstore get money
The technology responsible making exchange balanced predictable called transaction processing
Transactions ensure resource permanently updated unless operation within transactional unit complete successfully
By combining set related operation unit either completely succeeds completely fails one simplify error recovery make one application reliable
Transaction processing system consist computer hardware software hosting application performs routine transaction necessary conduct business
Examples include system manage sale order entry airline reservation payroll employee record manufacturing shipping
Since though necessarily transaction processing today interactive term often treated synonymous
Transaction processing designed maintain system Integrity typically modern known consistent state ensuring interdependent operation system either completed successfully canceled successfully
For example consider typical banking transaction involves moving customer saving account customer checking account
This transaction involves least two separate operation computer term debiting saving account crediting checking account
If one operation succeeds book bank balance end day
There must therefore way ensure either operation succeed fail never inconsistency bank database whole
Transaction processing link multiple individual operation single indivisible transaction ensures either operation transaction completed without error none
If operation completed error occur others attempted system roll back operation transaction including successful one thereby erasing trace transaction restoring system consistent known state processing transaction began
If operation transaction completed successfully transaction system change database made permanent transaction rolled back done
Transaction processing guard hardware software error might leave transaction partially completed
If computer system crash middle transaction transaction processing system guarantee operation uncommitted transaction cancelled
Generally transaction issued concurrently
If overlap
need touch portion database create conflict
For example customer mentioned example saving account attempt transfer different person time moving checking account one succeed
However forcing transaction processed sequentially inefficient
Therefore concurrent implementation transaction processing programmed guarantee end result reflects outcome could reached executing transaction sequentially order property called
In example mean matter transaction issued first either transfer different person move checking account succeeds one fails
The basic principle system
However terminology may vary one system another term used necessarily universal
system ensure database integrity recording intermediate state database modified using record restore database known state transaction committed
For example copy information database modification transaction set aside system transaction make modification sometimes called
If part transaction fails committed copy used restore database state transaction began
It also possible keep separate modification database management system
sometimes called
This required rollback failed transaction useful updating database management system event database failure system provide
If database management system fails entirely must restored recent
The reflect transaction committed since made
However database management system restored journal image applied database bring database management system date
Any transaction progress time failure rolled back
The result database consistent known state includes result transaction committed moment failure
In case two transaction may course processing attempt access portion database time way prevents proceeding
For example transaction A may access portion X database transaction B may access portion Y database
If point transaction A try access portion Y database transaction B try access portion X occurs neither transaction move forward
system designed detect deadlock occur
Typically transaction cancelled rolled back started different order automatically deadlock occur
Or sometimes one deadlocked transaction cancelled rolled back automatically restarted short delay
Deadlocks also occur among three transaction
The transaction involved difficult detect point transaction processing system find practical limit deadlock detect
In system commit rollback mechanism available undesirable often used undo failed transaction restore system previous state
defined property reliable transaction system late acronym atomicity consistency isolation durability
A transaction change state atomic either happen none happen
These change include database change message action transducer
A transaction correct transformation state
The action taken group violate integrity constraint associated state
Even though transaction execute concurrently appears transaction T others executed either T T
Once transaction completes successfully commits change database survive failure retain change Transaction processing benefit Standard first developed often closely coupled particular
implemented similar principle mixed success
However recent year distributed model become considerably difficult maintain
As number transaction grew response various online service especially single distributed database practical solution
In addition online system consist whole suite program operating together opposed strict model single server could handle transaction processing
Today number transaction processing system available work level scale large system including
One effort DTP see also JTA
However proprietary environment IBM still popular although CICS evolved include open industry standard well
The term used describe transaction processing system uncommonly challenging requirement particularly throughput requirement transaction per second
Such system may implemented via distributed cluster style architecture

In traditionally either kind variable
The latter may allow element mutated length changed may fixed creation
A string generally understood often implemented store sequence element typically character using
A string may also denote general sequence data type structure
Depending programming language precise data type used declared string may either cause storage memory statically allocated predetermined maximum length employ allow hold variable number element
When string appears literally known anonymous string
In used string finite sequence chosen called
Let Σ symbol alternatively called character called
No assumption made nature symbol
A Σ finite symbol Σ
For example Σ string Σ
The string number symbol length sequence often denoted
The unique string Σ length denoted
The set string Σ length denoted Σ
For example Σ Σ
Note Σ ε alphabet Σ
The set string Σ length Σ denoted Σ
In term Σ For example Σ Σ ε
Although set Σ element Σ string finite length
A set string Σ
Σ called Σ
For example Σ set string even number zero ε formal language important Σ
For two string Σ concatenation defined sequence symbol followed sequence character denoted
For example Σ b z
String concatenation operation
The empty string ε serf string ε ε
Therefore set Σ concatenation operation form generated Σ
In addition length function defines Σ integer function
A string said exist possibly empty string
The substring defines Σ empty string
A string said exists string
If nonempty said prefix
Symmetrically string said exists string
If nonempty said suffix
Suffixes prefix substring
Both relation prefix suffix
A string said rotation
For example Σ string rotation u v
The reverse string string symbol reverse order
For example abc b c symbol alphabet reverse cba
A string reverse madam called also includes empty string string length
It often useful define set string
If alphabet Σ cf
one define total order Σ called
For example Σ lexicographical order Σ includes relationship ε
The lexicographical order alphabetical order nontrivial alphabet even alphabetical order
See alternative string ordering preserve
A number additional operation string commonly occur formal theory

Strings admit following interpretation node graph The natural topology set string string discrete topology natural topology set infinite string viewing set infinite string set finite string
This construction used construction yield topology
string representation topology found normalizing according
A datatype modeled idea formal string
Strings important useful datatype implemented nearly every
In language available others
The programming language allows string usually quoted way represent instance string datatype called
Although formal string arbitrary finite length length string real language often constrained artificial maximum
In general two type string datatypes fixed maximum length determined compile time use amount memory whether maximum needed whose length arbitrarily fixed use varying amount memory depending actual requirement
Most string modern string
Of course even string limited length number bit available pointer size available
The string length stored separate integer may put artificial limit length implicitly termination character usually character value bit zero

String datatypes historically allocated one byte per character although exact character set varied region character encoding similar enough programmer could often get away ignoring since character program treated specially period space comma place encoding program would encounter
These character set typically based
If text one encoding displayed system using different encoding text often though often somewhat readable computer user learned read mangled text
language known collectively need far character limit one byte encoding reasonable representation
The normal solution involved keeping representation ASCII using representation CJK
Use existing code led problem matching cutting string severity depended character encoding designed
Some encoding family guarantee byte value ASCII range represent ASCII character making encoding safe system use character field separator
Other encoding make guarantee making matching byte code unsafe
These encoding also locating character boundary required backing start string pasting two string together could result corruption second string
simplified picture somewhat
Most programming language datatype Unicode string
Unicode preferred byte stream format designed problem described older multibyte encoding
require programmer know code unit different character main difficulty currently incorrectly designed APIs attempt hide difference make character due composing code
Some language like implement string used datatype exception rule
Some language normally allow content string changed created termed string
In language value fixed new string must created alteration made termed string
Strings typically implemented byte character code unit order allow fast access individual unit character fixed length
A language implement instead
Some language avoid implementing dedicated string datatype instead adopting convention representing string list character code
Representations string depend heavily choice character repertoire method character encoding
Older string implementation designed work repertoire encoding defined ASCII recent extension like series
Modern implementation often use extensive repertoire defined Unicode along variety complex encoding
The term usually indicates string byte rather string readable character string bit
Byte string often imply byte take value data stored meaning value interpreted termination value
Most string implementation similar entry storing corresponding character
The principal difference certain encoding single logical character may take one entry array
This happens example single code code point take anywhere one four byte single character take arbitrary number code
In case logical length string number character differs physical length array number byte use
avoids first part problem
The length string stored implicitly using special terminating character often NUL bit zero convention used perpetuated popular
Hence representation commonly referred
This representation string take space terminator thus
In terminated string terminating code allowable character string
Strings field limitation also store arbitrary
An example stored along modern representation The length string example character occupies byte
Characters terminator form part representation may either part data garbage
Strings form sometimes called original directive used declare
Using special byte null terminating string historically appeared hardware software though sometimes value also printing character
used many assembler system used system character value zero used since string delimiter BASIC language
Somewhat similar data processing machine like used special bit delimit string left operation would start right
This bit clear part string
This meant IBM word almost ever thought use feature override assignment seventh bit example handle ASCII code
Early microcomputer software relied upon fact ASCII code use bit set indicate end string
It must reset prior output
The length string also stored explicitly example prefixing string length byte value convention used many dialect consequence people call string
Storing string length byte limit maximum string length
To avoid limitation improved implementation use store string length
When field cover string limited
If length bounded encoded constant space typically machine word thus leading taking space number character word ASCII machine machine etc
If length bounded encoding length take log space see string encoding string length log space
In latter case field fixed length therefore actual string data need moved string grows length field need increased
Here Pascal string stored buffer along ASCII representation Many language including one implement string internal structure like However since implementation usually string must accessed modified member function
pointer dynamically allocated memory area might expanded needed
See also
Both character termination length code limit string For example C character array contain null NUL character handled directly C string library function Strings using length code limited maximum value length code
Both limitation overcome clever programming
It possible create data structure function manipulate problem associated character termination principle overcome length code bound
It also possible optimize string represented using technique replacing repeated character character value length
While representation common others possible
Using make certain string operation insertion deletion concatenation efficient
The core data structure one manages string sequence character represents current state file edited
While state could stored single long consecutive array character typical text editor instead us alternative representation sequence data line make certain string operation insertion deletion undoing previous edits efficient
The differing memory layout storage requirement string affect security program accessing string data
String representation requiring terminating character commonly susceptible problem terminating character present caused coding error deliberately altering data
String representation adopting separate length field also susceptible length manipulated
In case program code accessing string data requires ensure inadvertently access change data outside string memory limit
String data frequently obtained program
As responsibility program validate string ensure represents expected format
Performing limited validation cause program vulnerable attack
Sometimes string need embedded inside text file intended consumption machine
This needed example source code programming language configuration file
In case NUL character work well terminator since normally invisible difficult input via keyboard
Storing string length would also inconvenient manual computation tracking length tedious
Two common representation While character string common us string string computer science may refer generically sequence homogeneously typed data
A example may used represent retrieved communication medium
This data may may represented datatype depending need application desire programmer capability programming language used
If programming language string implementation data corruption may ensue
C programmer draw sharp distinction string aka string character definition always null terminated byte string pseudo string may stored array often null terminated
Using function byte string often seems work later lead
There many processing string various
Some category algorithm include Advanced string algorithm often employ complex mechanism data structure among
The name coined computer scientist issue algorithm data structure used string processing

In alternative string
It ability altered adding appending whereas String normally fixed
standard way handle text use
Any given Java mean changed
A
Whenever must manipulated change require creation new turn involves creation new array character copying original array
This happens even original value intermediate used manipulation kept
Java provides two alternate class string manipulation called
Both like array hold character
They however mutable state altered
Their array character necessarily completely filled opposed String whose array always exact required length content
Thus capability add remove change state without creating new object without creation new array array copying
The exception array longer suitable length hold content case rarely happens default Dynamic memory allocation provided JVM
In case required create new array copy content
For reason Java would handle expression like like Generally String string handling
However necessarily case since StringBuffer required recreate character array run space
Theoretically possible happen number time new String would required although unlikely programmer provide length hint prevent
Either way effect noticeable modern desktop computer
As well shortcoming array inherent
In order insert remove character arbitrary position whole section array must moved
The method attractive environment low processing power take ability using much memory likely also premium environment
This point however trivial considering space required creating many instance Strings order process
As well StringBuffer optimized waste little memory possible

We seen one function already output message
To use function always write name followed parenthesis
The word basically mean input function
Then function action depending argument
When multiple argument function separate comma
For example give multiple argument print order space separating
We demonstrate example
A function may also give back value like output
For example function short give back largest argument must number
The function friend behaves similarly function return smallest argument
Functions combined create complicated expression
You limited using function Python
In lesson learn define new function
If call function enough argument input many argument get error
For example requires least one input It important carefully read error get back code work

Can someone provide straightforward simpler possible explanation transaction applied computing even copied Wikipedia
A transaction unit work want treat whole
It either happen full
A classical example transferring money one bank account another
To first withdraw amount source account deposit destination account
The operation succeed full
If stop halfway money lost Very Bad
In modern database transaction also thing like ensure ca access data another person written halfway
But basic idea transaction ensure
They guarantee NOT situation money withdrawn one account deposited another
A transaction way representing state change
Transactions ideally four property commonly known ACID See Wikipedia entry detail
Although typically applied database
In particular see
A series data manipulation statement must either fully complete fully fail leaving database consistent state Here simple explanation
You need transfer buck account A account B
You either If something go wrong first second operation pair problem either buck disappeared appeared nowhere
A transaction mechanism allows mark group operation execute way either execute commit system state started execute rollback
either transfer buck leave account initial state
A transaction sequence one SQL operation treated unit
Specifically transaction appears run isolation furthermore system fails transaction either executed entirety
The concept transaction motivated two completely independent concern
One concurrent access database multiple client system resilient system failure
Transaction support known ACID property Properties Transactions Transactions following four standard property usually referred acronym ACID Transaction Control There following command used control transaction ACID tomicity onsistency solation urability When wish multiple transactional resource involved single transaction need use something like solution
quite widely supported
I would suggest definition processing would useful cover transaction concept computer science
From wikipedia In computer science transaction processing information processing divided individual indivisible operation called transaction
Each transaction must succeed fail complete unit remain intermediate state
In addition response noted least theory restriction whatsoever kind resource involved transaction
Most time database multiple distinct database also conceivable printer take part transaction cause transaction fail say event paper jam
I think transaction atomic action term DBMS
mean seperated
yes transction may several instruction system execute
binded together finished single basic task
example
need walk bridge let treat transction say need step
overall step seperated
done half two choice continue finish go back start point
like result transaction success committed fail rollback Transaction indivisible unit data processing transaction must ACID property ie Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durable Transaction nothing intermidiate mean transfer money one account another account one account lose much one gain amount transfer money one account another account still empty transaction Transaction defined collection task considered minimum processing unit
Each minimum processing unit divided
The main operation transaction read write
All transaction must contain four property commonly known ACID property purpose ensuring accuracy completeness data integrity

In style building structure element treat evaluation avoids data
It paradigm mean programming done declaration instead
In functional code output value function depends passed function calling function twice value argument produce result time contrast depending may produce different result different time called argument different program state
Eliminating change state depend function input make much easier understand predict behavior program one key motivation development functional programming
Functional programming origin developed investigate function definition
Many functional viewed elaboration lambda calculus
Another declarative programming paradigm based
In contrast change state command simplest example
Imperative programming mathematical sense
They may change value program state
Functions without therefore make sense
Because lack language expression result different value different time depending state executing program
Functional programming language largely emphasized rather commercial software development
However prominent programming language support functional programming also known used industrial commercial application wide variety organization
one world widely distributed language property untyped functional language addition imperative paradigm
Functional programming also supported like statistic financial analysis
Widespread declarative language like use element functional programming especially eschewing
Programming functional style also accomplished language specifically designed functional programming
For example imperative programming language subject book describing apply functional programming concept
This also true programming language
added construct facilitate functional style
The language also offer functional programming ability
An interesting case frequently written functional style presence side effect mutable state place grey area imperative functional language
provides theoretical framework describing function evaluation
It mathematical abstraction rather programming form basis almost current functional programming language
An equivalent theoretical formulation commonly perceived abstract lambda calculus preceded invention
Combinatory logic lambda calculus originally developed achieve clearer approach

presented lecture Can Programming Be Liberated From Style
A Functional Style Algebra Programs
He defines functional program built hierarchical way mean combining form allow algebra program modern language mean functional program follow
Backus paper popularized research functional programming though emphasized rather style associated functional programming
In created initially developed language later language
Also Edinburgh Burstall Darlington developed functional language
NPL based first introduced work program transformation
Burstall MacQueen Sannella incorporated polymorphic type checking ML produce language
ML eventually developed several dialect common
Meanwhile development simple impurely functional dialect Lisp described influential classic textbook brought awareness power functional programming wider community
In developed also called type theory associated functional program arbitrarily complex mathematical proposition expressed
This led powerful new approach influenced development many subsequent functional programming language
The began consensus form functional programming research implementation release ongoing since
A number concept paradigm specific functional programming generally foreign including
However programming language often hybrid several programming paradigm programmer using mostly imperative language may utilized concept
function either take function argument return result
In calculus example function return function
function closely related function function allow function argument result function
The distinction two subtle describes mathematical concept function operate function computer science term describes programming language entity restriction use thus function appear anywhere program entity like number including argument function return value
function enable technique applies function argument one time application returning new function accepts next argument
This let programmer succinctly express example addition operator partially applied one
expression memory
This mean pure function several useful property many used optimize code While compiler imperative programming language detect pure function perform elimination pure function call always library generally expose information thus preventing optimization involve external function
Some compiler add extra keywords programmer explicitly mark external function pure enable optimization
also let function designated
looping functional language usually accomplished via
invoke letting operation repeated reach
Though recursion requires maintaining stack recognized optimized compiler code used implement iteration imperative language
The language standard requires implementation recognize optimize tail recursion
Tail recursion optimization implemented transforming program compiling among approach
Common pattern recursion factored using higher order function fold unfolds obvious example
Such higher order function play role analogous control structure
Most general purpose functional programming language allow unrestricted recursion make cause unsoundness generally requires introduction logic expressed language
Some special purpose language allow recursion nonterminating computation expressed infinite stream value called
As consequence language fail Turing complete expressing certain function impossible still express wide class interesting computation avoiding problem introduced unrestricted recursion
Functional programming limited recursion constraint called
Functional language categorized whether use evaluation concept refer function argument processed expression evaluated
The technical difference expression containing failing divergent computation
Under strict evaluation evaluation term containing failing subterm fails
For example expression fails strict evaluation division zero third element list
Under lazy evaluation length function return value number item list since evaluating attempt evaluate term making list
In brief strict evaluation always fully evaluates function argument invoking function
Lazy evaluation evaluate function argument unless value required evaluate function call
The usual implementation strategy lazy evaluation functional language
Lazy evaluation used default several pure functional language including
argues lazy evaluation mechanism improving program modularity easing independent implementation producer consumer data stream
Launchbury describes difficulty lazy evaluation introduces particularly analyzing program storage requirement proposes aid analysis
Harper proposes including strict lazy evaluation language using language type system distinguish
Especially since development functional programming language tended use rejecting invalid program compilation time risking opposed accepts valid program compilation time risk used Lisp variant though reject invalid program runtime information enough reject valid program
The use make manipulation complex data structure convenient presence strong type checking make program reliable absence reliability technique like free programmer need manually declare type compiler case
Some functional language based let type depend term
Such type called
These type system decidable type inference difficult understand program
But dependent type express arbitrary proposition
Through program language become mean writing formal compiler generate
While language mainly interest academic research including begun used engineering well
subset written Coq formally verified
A limited form dependent type called GADT implemented way provides benefit dependently typed programming avoiding inconvenience
GADT available since version case class proposed addition language including Java C
Functional program assignment statement value variable functional program never change defined
This eliminates chance side effect variable replaced actual value point execution
So functional program referentially transparent
Consider assignment statement change value assigned variable
Let u say initial value two consecutive evaluation variable yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
In fact assignment statement never referentially transparent
Now consider another function transparent implicitly change input x thus
Functional program exclusively use type function therefore referentially transparent
It possible use functional style programming language traditionally considered functional language
For example explicitly support pure function
inception
Amrit Prem added support Python well closure Python though Python relegated reduce standard library module
function introduced mainstream language
In lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style
In sometimes used simulate however anonymous class always proper replacement limited capability
Java support lambda expression replacement anonymous class
However presence checked exception Java make functional programming inconvenient necessary catch checked exception rethrow problem occur JVM language checked exception Scala
In necessary lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style C
Many expressible functional programming term example simply dictate use function pattern roughly corresponds
Similarly idea immutable data functional programming often included imperative programming language example tuple Python immutable array
Purely functional often represented different way counterpart
For example constant access update time basic component imperative language many imperative based array
Arrays replaced admit purely functional implementation access update time
Therefore purely functional data structure used language may efficient tool especially persistence required
Functional programming different
The significant difference stem fact functional programming avoids used imperative programming implement state
Pure functional programming completely prevents provides
function rarely used older imperative programming
A traditional imperative program might use loop traverse modify list
A functional program hand would probably use map function take function list generating returning new list applying function list item
There task example maintaining bank account balance often seem naturally implemented state
Pure functional programming performs task task accepting user input printing screen different way
The pure functional programming language implement using derived
Monads offer way abstract certain type computational pattern including limited modeling computation mutable state side effect imperative manner without losing purity
While existing monad may easy apply program given appropriate template example many student find difficult understand conceptually asked define new monad sometimes needed certain type library
Another way functional language simulate state passing around represents current state parameter function call
On function call copy data structure created whatever difference result function
This referred
Impure functional language usually include direct method managing mutable state
example us managed reference updated applying pure function current state
This kind approach enables mutability still promoting use pure function preferred way express computation
Alternative method developed track side effect program
Some modern research language use make presence side effect explicit
Functional programming language typically le efficient use memory imperative language
This related fact mutable data structure like array straightforward implementation using present hardware highly evolved Turing machine
Flat array may accessed efficiently deeply pipelined CPUs prefetched efficiently cache complex handled SIMD instruction
It also easy create equally efficient immutable counterpart
For purely functional language slowdown logarithmic number memory cell used mutable memory represented purely functional data structure logarithmic access time balanced tree
However slowdown universal
For program perform intensive numerical computation functional language slightly slower C according
For program handle large multidimensional functional language designed speed optimization
Immutability data many case lead execution efficiency allowing compiler make assumption unsafe imperative language thus increasing opportunity
may also speed program even asymptotically whereas may slow constant factor however may introduce used improperly
Launchbury discus theoretical issue related memory leak lazy evaluation give practical advice analyzing fixing
However general implementation lazy evaluation making extensive use dereferenced code data perform poorly modern processor deep pipeline cache cache miss may cost hundred cycle
Imperative program environment sequence step manipulating environment
Functional program expression successively substituted reach normal form

It since become popular building range application company
The dialect used basis several application early computer recently applied problem training control
introduced seen commercial use area financial analysis verification industrial programming static analysis
though initially intended research language also applied range company area aerospace system hardware design web programming
Other functional programming language seen use industry include hybrid support purely functional imperative programming

I personally find somewhat sad functional language taught predominantly used
I think least comp sci student exposed language major paradigm procedural functional dynamic
I think well balanced CS student taught language programming language type
I much experience Haskell I heard programmer rave
Understanding construct functional programming useful many situation help programmer become better organizing algorithm language well
Take pick
C yadda yadda
This type need taught simply modern business want

These le common day still learned perspective
The method employ still practicality every language boil instruction
And imperative language good listing following instruction
ProLog
I never found good practical use language I found concept behind logical language handy trying figure write method object oriented language
I get focus long logical language college year I think stronger focus might done good
The language every graduating CS major know one maximizes potential landing great job
That going change time going change based individual definition going vary geographic region
For moment I say language every CS major know course varies region
I think change time ideally language different perspective
In day procedural OO functional Pascal LISP
I sold particularly three
But I interview I look As another trade I think CS program need train student prominent language market place
At given time I think language serious prominence majority job
I think school owes student provide opportunity learn language depth training available least one
For CS student look programming language closely mapped CS concept discussed
I suggest The list could go way fundamental idea pretty simple Teach student programming language best suited way want teach concept
order get idea going behind scene whatever programming language using
help grasp basic concept like dead code various type optimization good compiler able
Lisp CLOS OOP Haskell
This question restricted student
New fancy programming language borrowed copied stolen

You prepare future
Functional programming style important today introduced imperative programming language like C LINQ lambda many
It bad student learning Java
I think language important people believe
Yes need know program etc many great programmer drawing experience help developing
Students could lesson programming book method would make rounded option better
I learnt programming software development I left university started work
Usually itch behind question What buzzword I put resume land job
Though question merit resume first screened HR people hat comprehension looking
shallow passed gate need deliver good
It language know make good bad programmer use
For basically two category programmer The one concentrate learning language core
The important language use
At extreme tend super optimize every little speck code often use obscure feature
Then one want learn technique paradigm
What language use really matter long express mental picture elegantly
At extreme tend use UML system hoping others grunt work coding
In opinion need

provide guidance organize train thought towards working solution problem hand without remains idea forever floating limbo vaporware heaven hell depending look
give mean implement idea real working system without system tend towards cancerous shapeless monster
I believe partially answered question
Of real importance give student opportunity come contact several paradigm actual language matter
Ofcourse important primarily teach paradigm give work opportunity probably OOP moment
Accordingly also better teach broadly used language paradigm useful learning something likely never use
Therefore I also hated write pseudo code exam
Pseudocode fine long syntax
You able bring concept across
So concretely OOP Java At least additional programming paradigm make student aware approach
Functional Lisp
Assembly language microcode
A CS student understand foundation layer abstraction boolean state machine latest
programming language paradigm
Basic Logo Squeak
ever want able understand teach small kid computer literacy
Fortran Cobol Lisp want understand history programming language actual problem modern practice fix
Choosing language different paradigm hard many good answer given
But I choose one language I go Scala functional object oriented
You explain compare different approach within language
Do forget language
They real
They emphasize building complexity using small primitive
You use write code feel darn clean
The classic language day
Also worth checking
Do miss
It fun bag full hammer
Something functional Haskell Lisp would first choice maybe Erlang
Functional language really teach build abstraction powerful way
Despite lack I find D specifically version provides interesting lesson ca easily learned elsewhere
It make serious attempt language I think get functional programming play nice allow programming low level pointer manual memory management inline assembly language high level generic generative programming language
This valuable rather seeing paradigm isolation existed different universe get see forest tree
You get see strength weakness paradigm fine grained level blend program
You get see major aspect paradigm implemented library term code
The standard library module implement important functional programming primitive yet straight simple D code magic
Similarly implement lazy evaluation fairly simple D code
You get understand cost involved primitive paradigm D feature make really going hood relatively transparent
You even write something look like C create pretty interface language magic glue layer getting way
Pseudocode
People field able explain idea coherent structured way without jargon
I know difference square bracket brace order understand algorithm
I need know mean switch
Write plain language structure format like code
Anyone implement whatever language like
edit This answer partly motivated inabililty programmer write pseudocode
Just write algorithm pseudocode What
The benefit pseudocode stakeholder understand
I suggesting want BAs user proofing code however help understanding required algorithm
Psuedocode remove need explain essentially boilerplate jargon
Of course one know one language old procedural language
But I go desert island one compiler I go good old gcc
You understand programming know programming

In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

I see lot talk functional language stuff
Why would use one traditional language
What better
What worse
What ideal functional programming application
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Functional language use different paradigm imperative object oriented language
They use side effect free function basic building block language
This enables lot thing make lot thing difficult case different people used One biggest advantage functional programming order execution side effect free function important
For example erlang used enable concurrency transparent way
And function functional language behave similar mathematical function easy translate functional language
In case make code readable
Traditionally one big disadvantage functional programming also lack side effect
It difficult write useful software without IO IO hard implement without function
So people never got functional programming calculating single output single input
In modern mixed paradigm language like F scala easier
Lots modern language element functional programming language
C lot functional programming feature functional programming python
I think reason popularity functional programming mostly two reason
Concurrency getting real problem normal programming getting multiprocessor computer
And language getting accessible
I think question functional approach programming catching use style programming year
Whenever OO programmer writes clean code favor immutable object code borrowing functional concept
However language functional style getting lot virtual ink day whether language become dominant future open question
My suspicion hybrid language likely dominate purist functional language way pure OO language Smalltalk Beta etc
influenced mainstream programming ended notation
Finally I ca resist pointing comment FP highly parallel remark I heard procedural programmer many year ago Just graphical user interface code model business concept helped OO become widely appreciated I believe increased use immutability simpler massive parallelism help programmer see benefit functional approach offer
But much learned make entire history digital computer programming I think still much learn
Twenty year programmer look back amazement primitive nature tool currently using OO FP language
The main plus inherent parallelism especially moving away MHz towards core
I think become next programming paradigm completely replace OO type method I think get point need either write code functional language general purpose language grow include functional construct
Even never work functional language professionally understanding functional programming make better developer
It give new perspective code programming general
I say reason learn
I think language good job mixing functional imperative style interesting likely succeed
I always skeptical Next Big Thing
Lots time Next Big Thing pure accident history right place right time matter whether technology good
Examples Perl
All flawed technology wildly successful perceived either solve problem day nearly identical entrenched standard
Functional programming may indeed great mean adopted
But I tell people functional programming many many programmer kind conversion experience discover using functional language make twice productive maybe ten time productive producing code resilient change fewer bug
These people think functional programming secret weapon good example mindset Paul Graham
Oh application
web apps
Since early also buzz functional programming parallelism
Since people like worrying parallelism since least I holding breath functional language solve multicore problem
But explain additional buzz right
In general American university poor job teaching functional programming
There strong core support Haskell also enjoys support little way teaching advanced technique functional programmer
I taught course Harvard spring Tufts
Benjamin Pierce taught course Penn
I know Paul Hudak done anything Yale
The European university much better job example functional programming emphasized important place Denmark Netherlands Sweden UK
I le sense happening Australasia
I see anyone mentioning elephant room I think JavaScript functional language
As people advanced thing JS especially leveraging finer point jQuery Dojo framework FP introduced
In conjunction closure FP make JS code really light yet still readable
Cheers PS I bet know functional programming used Most application simple enough solved normal OO way OO way always normal
This decade standard last decade marginalized concept
Functional programming math
substitute functional programming Lisp So short explanation language obsolete technology math math get stale
The right thing compare Lisp hardware say Quicksort algorithm discovered still fastest sort
The average corporate programmer
people I work understand work environment let program That one matter time though
Your average corporate programmer learns whatever current Big Thing
year ago understand OOP
FP catch average corporate programmer follow
It really taught university nowadays
Varies lot
At university SML first language student introduced
I believe MIT teach LISP course
These two example may representative course I believe university least offer optional course FP even make mandatory part curriculum
Most application simple enough solved normal OO way It really matter simple enough though
Would solution readable robust elegant performant FP
Many thing simple enough solved Java still requires godawful amount code
In case keep mind FP proponent claimed Next Big Thing several decade
Perhaps right keep mind made claim year ago
One thing definitely count favor though recently C taken sharp turn towards FP extent practically turning generation programmer FP programmer
That might pave way FP revolution
Maybe
Man understand perfection imperfection chosen art see value art
Following rule permit development point technique student artist learn seek
It make sense study art well strategy
Who learned something watching activity others
To learn sword study guitar
To learn fist study commerce
To study sword make permit grow outward
Miyamoto Musashi A Book Five Rings I think realistic people think functional programming catch becomes main paradigm like OO
After business problem pretty math problem hairy imperative rule move data around display various way mean good fit pure functional programming paradigm learning curve monad far exceeds OO
OTOH functional programming make programming fun
It make appreciate inherent timeless beauty succinct expression underlying math universe
People say learning functional programming make better programmer
This course highly subjective
I personally think completely true either
It make better sentient
One key feature functional language concept function
The idea pas function parameter function return value
Functional programming involves writing code change state
The primary reason successive call function yield result
You write functional code language support function language like Haskell allow change state
In fact supposed make side effect like printing text sound like could completely useless
Haskell instead employ different approach IO monad
These object contain desired IO operation executed interpreter toplevel
At level simply object system
What advantage functional programming provide
Functional programming allows coding fewer potential bug component completely isolated
Also using recursion function allows simple proof correctness typically mirror structure code
F could catch Microsoft pushing
Pro Contra So I give chance F become important
Other functional language going make near future
I point everything said functional language people saying langauges year ago
Back common hear OO Change come somewhere
A meaningful important change make happen regardless whether people trained earlier technology take opinion change necessary
Do think change OO good despite people time
I must dense I still get
Are actual example small app written functional language like F look source code see better use approach say C
Most application solved insert favorite language paradigm etc

Although true different tool used solve different problem
Functional allows another high higher
level abstraction allows job effectively used correctly
I think one reason
Unfortunately thing rarely simple
For example I would argue biggest factor behind Python acceptance language although pretty important
The biggest reason Python popular huge standard library even bigger community party library
Languages like Clojure F may exception rule considering built upon
As result I answer
It seems people never learned Lisp Scheme undergraduate discovering
As lot thing field tendency hype create high expectation
It pas
Functional programming great
However take world
C Java C etc still around
What come I think ability example implementing thing functional language giving access stuff language
When reading The Next Mainstream Programming Language A Game Perspective Tim Sweeney Epic Games first thought I got learn Haskell
Things moving functional direction
The two cool new kid past year Ruby Python radically closer functional language came much Lispers started supporting one close enough
And massively parallel hardware putting evolutionary pressure everyone functional language best place deal change far leap think Haskell F next big thing
Have following evolution programming language lately
Every new release mainstream programming language seems borrow feature functional programming
Closures anonymous function passing returning function value used exotic feature known Lisp ML hacker
But gradually C Delphi Python Perl Javascript added support closure
Its possible language taken seriously without closure
Several language notably Python C Ruby native support list comprehension list generator
ML pioneered generic programming support generic parametric polymorphism become industry standard last year
If I remember correctly Fortran supported generic followed Java C Delphi
I know supported template since discussion STL start demon
What make feature appealing programmer
It plainly obvious
All language future going support minimum closure want stay competitive
In respect functional programming already mainstream
Most application simple enough solved normal OO way Who say ca use functional programming simple thing
Not every functional program need compiler theorem prover massively parallel telecommunication switch
I regularly use F ad hoc throwaway script addition complicated project
It catching best tool around controlling complexity
See slide Simon talk A Taste Haskell The Next Mainstream Programming Language A Game Developer Perspective Tim Sweeney Checkout I agree first point time change
Corporations respond even late adopter see advantage
Life dynamic
They teaching Haskell ML Stanford late
I sure place like Carnegie Mellon MIT Stanford good school presenting student
I agree expose relational database web apps continue vein long time
Java EE RoR PHP evolved pretty good solution problem
You hit something important It might problem ca solved easily mean boost functional programming
What would
Will massive multicore hardware cloud computing push along
Because FP significant benefit term productivity reliability maintainability
may killer app finally get big corporation switch despite large volume legacy even big commercial language like C taking distinct functional flavour result concern side effect simply fit well concurrency parallelism
I agree normal programmer wo understand
They like eventually understood OOP mysterious weird
Also university teach FP many even teach first programming course
Wow interesting discussion
My thought FP make task relatively simple compared language
language already starting take idea FP I suspect trend continue see merge help people make leap FP easier
I know whether catch investigation functional language almost certainly worth learning make better programmer
Just understanding referential transparency make lot design decision much resulting program much easier reason
Basically run problem tends problem output single function rather problem inconsistant state could caused hundred imparative language side effect
The stateless nature FP map naturally stateless nature web thus functional language lend easily elegant RESTFUL webapps
Contrast JAVA framework need resort horribly ugly HACKS like VIEWSTATE SESSION key maintain application state maintain occasionally quite leaky abstraction stateful imperative language essentially stateless functional platform like web
And also stateless application easily lend parallel processing
Terribly important web website happens get popular
It always straightforward add hardware site get better performance
My view catch Microsoft pushed much mainstream
For attractive u new challenge job opportunity resents future
Once mastered another tool help make u productive programmer
A point missed discussion best type system found contemporary FP language
What compiler infer least type automatically
It interesting one spends half time writing type name programming Java yet Java far type safe
While may never write type Haskell programm except kind compiler checked documentation code type safe
In addition answer casting solution pure functional term force one understand problem better
Conversely thinking functional style develop problem solving skill
functional paradigm better afford additional angle attack

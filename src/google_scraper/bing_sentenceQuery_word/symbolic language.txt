In together set rule specific
The formal language set symbol letter token string language may formed
The string formed alphabet called word word belong particular formal language sometimes called
A formal language often defined mean also called
The field study primarily purely aspect internal structural pattern
Formal language theory sprang linguistics way understanding syntactic regularity
In computer science formal language used among others basis defining grammar formalized version subset natural language word language represent concept associated particular meaning
In typically defined formal language defined set formal language limited computational power
In formal language used represent syntax philosophy mathematics reduced syntactic manipulation formal language way
The first formal language thought one used literally meaning concept writing Frege described formal language pure thought
early used rewriting string influential
An context formal language although often make sense use usual sense word generally
The element alphabet called
An alphabet may contain number element however definition formal language theory specify alphabet finite number element result apply
A alphabet finite sequence letter
The set word alphabet Σ usually denoted Σ using
The length word number letter composed
For alphabet one word length often denoted e ε λ even Λ
By one combine two word form new word whose length sum length original word
The result concatenating word empty word original word
In application especially alphabet also known word known break metaphor replaces metaphor
A alphabet Σ Σ set alphabet
Sometimes set word grouped expression whereas rule constraint may formulated creation expression
In computer science mathematics usually deal adjective formal often omitted redundant
While formal language theory usually concern formal language described syntactical rule actual definition concept formal language possibly infinite set string composed given alphabet le
In practice many language described rule
The notion may closer intuitive concept language one described syntactic rule
By abuse definition particular formal language often thought equipped formal grammar describes
The following rule describe formal language alphabet Σ Under rule string string
This formal language express addition addition equality express look like mean
For instance nowhere rule indication mean number zero mean addition
For finite language one explicitly enumerate word
For example describe language b ab cba
The case construction contains word
However even finite alphabet Σ b infinite number word potentially expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab
Therefore formal language typically infinite describing infinite formal language simple writing b ab cba
Here example formal language Formal language used tool multiple discipline
However formal language theory rarely concern particular language except example mainly concerned study various type formalism describe language
For instance language given Typical question asked formalism include Surprisingly often answer decision problem done extremely expensive characterization expensive
Therefore formal language theory major application area
Formal language may classified based expressive power generative grammar well complexity recognizing
provide good compromise expressivity ease widely used practical application
Certain operation language common
This includes standard set operation union intersection complement
Another class operation application string operation
Examples suppose language common alphabet
Such used investigate class language
A class language closed particular operation operation applied language class always produce language class
For instance known closed union concatenation intersection closed intersection complement
The theory study common closure property language family right
A compiler usually two distinct component
A generated tool like identifies token programming language grammar
expressed simpler formal language usually mean
At basic conceptual level usually generated like attempt decide source program valid belongs programming language compiler built
Of course compiler parse source code usually translate executable format
Because parser usually output answer typically
This used subsequent stage compiler eventually generate containing run directly hardware requires execute
In set expressed formal language
A also called consists formal language together also called
The deductive apparatus may consist set may interpreted valid rule inference set
A formal system used one expression one expression
Although formal language identified formula formal system likewise identified theorem
Two formal system may theorem yet differ significant way formula A may syntactic consequence formula B one another instance
A finite sequence formula may interpreted axiom follows preceding formula sequence
The last sentence sequence theorem formal system
Formal proof useful theorem interpreted true proposition
Formal language entirely syntactic nature may given give meaning element language
For instance mathematical set possible formula particular logic formal language assigns meaning
The study interpretation formal language called
In mathematical logic often done term
In model theory term occur formula interpreted object within fixed compositional interpretation rule determine truth value formula derived interpretation term formula interpretation term formula becomes true

In also called scientific area refers study development manipulating
Although properly speaking computer algebra subfield generally considered distinct field scientific computing usually based approximate symbolic computation emphasizes computation expression containing given value manipulated symbol
application perform symbolic calculation called term alluding complexity main application include least method represent mathematical data computer user programming language usually different language used implementation dedicated memory manager mathematical expression large set perform usual operation like simplification expression using etc
Computer algebra widely used experiment mathematics design formula used numerical program
It also used complete scientific computation purely numerical method fail problem
Some author distinguish using latter name refer kind symbolic computation computation mathematical
Some author use computer science aspect subject computer algebra mathematical aspect
In language name field direct translation English name
Typically called French mean formal computation
This name reflects tie field
Symbolic computation also referred past term also refer manipulation use referring computer algebra
There specific computer algebra function assumed named Special Interest Group Symbolic Algebraic Manipulation
There several annual conference computer algebra premier International Symposium Symbolic Algebraic Computation regularly sponsored SIGSAM
There several journal specializing computer algebra top one founded
There also several journal regularly publish article computer algebra
As highly efficient approximate common computer algebra emphasize computation exactly represented data
Such exact representation implies even size output small intermediate data generated computation may grow unpredictable way
This behavior called
To obviate problem various method used representation data well algorithm manipulate
The usual number system used either number fixed bounded size improperly called
None convenient computer algebra expression swell
Therefore basic number used computer algebra integer mathematician commonly represented unbounded signed sequence usually largest base allowed
These integer allow define two integer
Programming efficient implementation arithmetic operation hard task
Therefore free commercial one like use thus standard
Except every may viewed symbol operator followed operand
In computer algebra software expression usually represented way
This representation flexible many thing seem mathematical expression first glance may represented manipulated
For example equation expression operator matrix may represented expression matrix operator row operand
Even program may considered represented expression operator procedure least two operand list parameter body expression body operator sequence instruction operand
Conversely mathematical expression may viewed program
For example expression may viewed program addition parameter
Executing program consists expression given value result evaluation simply input
This process delayed evaluation fundamental computer algebra
For example operator equation also computer algebra system name program equality test normally evaluation equation result equation equality test needed explicitly asked user evaluation Boolean command automatically started system case test inside evaluation boolean executed
As size operand expression unpredictable may change working session sequence operand usually represented sequence either like entry like
The raw application basic rule respect expression give result Such complicated expression clearly acceptable procedure simplification needed soon one work general expression
This simplification normally done
There several class rewriting rule considered
The simplest consists rewriting rule always reduce size expression like
They systematically applied computer algebra system
The first difficulty occurs like addition multiplication
The standard way deal associativity consider addition multiplication arbitrary number operand represented
Thus simplified displayed
What
To deal problem simplest way rewrite systematically respectively
In word internal representation expression subtraction division unary minus outside representation number
A second difficulty occurs addition multiplication
The problem recognize quickly order combine canceling
In fact method finding like term consisting testing every pair term costly practicable long sum product
For solving problem sort operand sum product function comparison designed order like term consecutive place thus easily detected
In designed generating collision like term entered allowing combine soon introduced
This design hash function allows also recognize immediately expression subexpressions appear several time computation store
This allows save memory space also speed computation avoiding repetition operation several identical expression
Some rewriting rule sometimes increase sometimes decrease size expression applied
This case
For example distributivity law allows rewriting As way make good general choice applying rewriting rule rewriting done explicitly asked user
For distributivity computer function apply rewriting rule generally called expand
The reverse rewriting rule called factor requires algorithm thus key function computer algebra system see
In section consider fundamental mathematical question arise soon one want manipulate computer
We consider mainly case
This real restriction soon appearing expression simplified usually considered new indeterminates
For example viewed polynomial There two notion equality
The equality expression mean written represented computer way
As trivial rarely considered mathematician equality easy test program
The two expression represent mathematical object like It known may exist algorithm decides two expression representing number semantically equal exponential logarithm allowed expression
Therefore semantical equality may tested class expression
To test equality two expression instead design specific algorithm usual put put difference test syntactic equality result
Unlike usual mathematics canonical form normal form synonymous computer algebra
A two expression canonical form semantically equal syntactically equal expression normal form semantically zero syntactically zero
In word zero unique representation expression normal form
Normal form usually preferred computer algebra several reason
Firstly canonical form may costly compute normal form
For example put polynomial canonical form one expand every product necessary normal form see
Secondly It may case like expression involving radical canonical form exists depends arbitrary choice choice may different two expression computed independently
This may make impracticable use canonical form
At beginning computer algebra circa first put computer turned highly inefficient
Therefore large part work researcher field consisted revisiting classical order make discover implement effectiveness
A typical example kind work computation required simplify fraction
Surprisingly classical turned inefficient polynomial infinite field thus new algorithm needed developed
The also true classical algorithm

Just human use language communicate different region different language computer also language specific
Different kind language developed perform different type work computer
Basically language divided two category according computer understands
There also type language include These language mutually exclusive language belong multiple category
The term also open interpretation language considered considered language continued develop
computer language either machine code close
A computer understand instruction given language English
It understand execute instruction given form machine language
binary
There two type language Machine language lowest elementary level programming language first type programming language developed
Machine language basically language computer understand usually written hex
In fact manufacturer design computer obey one language machine code represented inside computer string binary digit bit
The symbol stand absence electric pulse stand presence electric pulse
Since computer capable recognizing electric signal understands machine language
Assembly language developed overcome many inconvenience machine language
This another important language operation code operand given form alphanumeric symbol instead l
These alphanumeric symbol known mnemonic code combine maximum combination
ADD addition SUB subtraction START LABEL etc
Because feature assembly language also known Symbolic Programming Language
This language also difficult need lot practice master little English support language
Mostly assembly language used help compiler orientation
The instruction assembly language converted machine code language translator executed computer
computer language use format similar English
The purpose developing language enable people write program easily native language environment English
language basically symbolic language use English word mathematical symbol rather mnemonic code
Each instruction language translated many machine language instruction computer understand
Many language developed achieving variety different task
Some fairly specialized others quite general
These language categorized according use These language oriented towards computational procedure solving mathematical statistical problem

Language understood system communication us symbolism convey meaning
thought system communication us symbol convey deep meaning
Symbols word image body language sound etc
Language symbolic way summarized sentence paragraph generally talking symbol stand something else used communicate imbued meaning
For simple example symbolic language word cat symbolic idea cat dollar symbol economic value word yes nod symbol confirmation grimace symbol disapproval smiley face emoji symbol happiness
If I want communicate happiness simple offering symbolic emoji friend
That simple symbol one meaning fairly common meaning general communication value work conveying idea people
That said symbol use practice anything simple
Most symbol mean many different thing mean different thing different people depending number controllable uncontrollable factor like context subtext past experience communicating
Luckily use mix symbol better illustrate complex idea quickly
Unfortunately using single term even mix term deep complex concept lead world communication problem
Consider following point study meaning
When say language symbolic talking say symbol use mean symbol use mean trying communicate
Language symbolic symbol use deeper symbolic semantic meaning beyond literal meaning
The study called meaning observant sign Greek term popularized John Locke see
Another way say signifier symbol signify represent meaning literal meaning even common dictionary meaning AKA signification
For simple example symbol A rock rock
I look using communicate
It symbolic rock rock
If person meaning purely literal communication value symbol
If person sense literal meaning communication value symbol
In way almost communication tool symbolic use mix complex symbol differing meaning express specific idea specifically illicit specific understanding communicate
While topic rock symbolism say symbol heavy meaning conveys heavy concept symbol weight
Symbols powerful think like country flag emblem people rally around
The go historic figure event law gesture photo act song
When pair together symbol creates type religion term state creates
Here one note symbol direct communication value indirect value well example one creates identity symbol created imbued meaning someone never met
More
book published two volume largely symbolic nature language Book II III specifically discus example see chapter rest book deal epistemology semiotics
To Locke logic one sphere human understanding others Locke many others including Greeks physic ethic realm sign consider logic expressed sign
More recent work semantics symbolic language include
explored many great thinker
Speaking semantics call thing stand actual thing sign call thing stand metaphysical concept symbol
In term consider symbol sign analogous
Jung master symbology sign term metaphysics like Locke master empirical sense Chomsky modern master logical sense consider checking Jung work
Symbols categorized number way
One way consider
In simplest form every letter used form formal written spoken language symbol
Words symbolize meaning phrase combination word symbolize different meaning
Then word phrase take different meaning different context
However noted letter word symbolic
Any transferred entity way thought symbolic deeper meaning whether meaning conveyed intentionally symbol defined sense something mean something else
In respect thing like tone inflection symbolic well
Meanwhile purposefully using symbol mix symbol communicate allows u express complex idea many deep meaning thus combination symbol symbolic
For example spoken phrase like need talk single word like oh used literally symbolic literal meaning paired specific body language tone infection social cue take deeper meaning
Meanings change context sometimes subtle social cue change meaning symbol completely
Thus meaning static much based context context communicator context listener
For another example page I use mix image video word phrase question statement metaphor symbolic tool define language symbolism
One written word may symbolic singular literal meaning paired word sentence paragraph page read context many layer complexity able conveyed
If I send loved one emoji blue sweet I send stranger creepy
The symbol change context
Furthermore loved one bad mood may differently good mood context matter way
A straight line near meaningless represent meaningful binary code form foundation computer software
A wave hand mean hello mean I love mean hail Caesar depends
Thus symbol use symbolic given symbol deep semantic meaning context subtext paring symbol allows u express complex idea deep
noted lead miscommunication
We define symbol defined symbol identify symbol
Sure give name term make code language term already defined imbued thick layer meaning emotion symbolism
Some term like realm politics metaphysics semantical art emotion allegiance run high carry ton weight hard avoid gravity note phrase symbolic deep meaning symbol
This make communicating complex symbol complicating task
Learn
Suffice say definition language concerned symbol formal AKA defined bounded specific informal combining symbol express meaning
We also consider aspect meaning expressed intentionally intentionally reading unintentional body language social cue
We may able define broad system like completely argue discrete system specifically property discrete infinity limited symbol combination symbol meaningless unlimited create essentially endless construct limited set symbol
See
Below video explaining mean say formal language
Check Noam Chomsky Steven Pinker video perspective qualified linguist
The core theory language symbolic symbol language complexity come span work figure like Locke Chomsky page
Feel free comment
A picture worth thousand word one modest
The picture tell story wet sand used glide large statue stone across sand Ancient Egypt Pyramids built
It took u around find understand symbolism old Egyptian drawing despite front face whole time
The lesson purposefully attempting convey meaning part battle come communication lot common rulesets using symbol context
Another takeaway symbol layer deep metaphysical meaning practical like symbol essentially constitute single basic meaning
As eluded Lady liberty American flag bald Eagle national anthem quote Thomas Jefferson paper Alexander Hamilton Constitution symbol
Something simple color Red White Blue vastly different complex meaning depending simply context presentation
Just like nation religion political party sport team city club
Each identity creates symbolism imbues symbol meaning sometimes meaning known group
For something way headier see
As phrased well article present excerpt Hayakawa The process mean human being arbitrarily make certain thing thing may called Whenever two human being communicate agreement make anything stand In Binary
Symbols sometimes strict meaning context bound clearly defined
However talking system lose boundary
So outside binary redefine conversation think I get
So despite inherent I hoping feel like end page
There many way muse concept language symbolic best cover
When doubt check great like Chomsky Pinker forget also study disagree stance full picture
With covered noted many different way define language express concept behind communicate beyond looking symbolic nature communication
semantics
Other definition language focus neurology communication tool nature language
I feel encapsulated studying symbol since topic ultimately semantic stop studying page say least
The goal get thinking language symbolism
Before move deeper explainers insight let clarify term
For purpose article Below excellent overview language Harvard professor Steven Pinker compliment study language work symbolic system
Have ever thought hard say mean
I

Symbols used communication tool language include written spoken word number equation picture body language inflection tone voice sound like expression metaphor rhythm pitch clothes wear slight gesture eye movement literally anything think another person directly indirectly
If covey sensory data carry meaning symbol
Different symbol different meaning different context studying system work root much social science language art art general
Examples language include mathematics
Even simple symbol like emoji phrase carry lot deep meaning regard emotion
A simple well placed stroke pen land jail could easily lose life long friend choice word
Even lack communication symbolic thus even absence symbol symbolic
Even building run concept symbolism much like Turning machine
It human communicate symbol taught computer well
What say one thing people understand another
Our wired understand process information much
We rely symbolism metaphor context express deep meaning interestingly control input
It always others process say conscious subconscious level
The power symbolism vast especially formal symbol sure meaning convey
Although ability clearly convey deep meaning including emotion something think every time communicate something know intuitively field like little swoosh convey one symbol struggle convey tome
The practice using symbol communication least old first communication ancestor
We see pictograph symbol painted cave wall find ancient text civilization
Over change meaning word symbol change rapidly well
Given changing meaning symbol language information must constantly translated retain original meaning language change
Human communication revolutionized speech approximately year ago
Symbols developed year ago writing year ago
In simplest form every letter used form formal written spoken language symbol
Words symbolize meaning phrase combination word symbolize different meaning
These take different meaning depending context
The word good symbol different idea according given dictionary
Depending context basic way mean anything evil honorable
In realistic way good word complex symbol mean much dictionary definition
It within line thinking consider language symbolic way use symbol convey meaning communication
Below explore way form language symbolic symbolism important communication
Language symbolic symbol use stand concept
It also symbolic metaphorical sense combination symbol array alternate meaning
For example I throwing towel meant interpreted literally expression us throwing towel mean giving
Since consider language symbolic call type symbolic language metaphor purpose article avoids confusion semantics word
When string word phrase picture together paint metaphorical picture
In case deep meaning derived without word ever said
Allegorical story teach u morality sometimes without ever expressing point directly
Symbolism play metaphor language symbolism involves using symbol metaphor
Imagine explaining someone cross symbol mean
It hard convey breadth using English language
We could write tome meaning cross today throughout history
It mean different thing different culture
Symbols like male female symbol star David symbol even emoticon convey world meaning
They used symbol make statement
These universal symbol interpreted different depending upon number factor resonate carry meaning throughout almost culture
Because cave painting used pictograph symbol sometimes understand intention today communicate idea u
Other complex symbol represented word dead language elude u one decode lose meaning translation
Mathematic symbol represent number typically easier backward engineer rational rather invented one like Modern English language
What mean
How
Or
Symbols powerful hold weight
What meaning F paper rather A
All symbol weight tell story
Admittedly little much cramming powerful symbol meme
However precisely power meme trying convey
More meaning pictographic symbol word phrase differ culture culture
Some interpret meaning phrase word differently others translate best corresponding word phrase culture
Some culture word concept culture struggle even describe
Assume I speaking someone speaks version English
I say word good convey number thing based context tone
If I say nice loving way reaction likely positive
Good mean much nice word
If I say good carry meaning different nuance
This phrase invokes idea something bad evil
With simple phrase I implied morality judged
We pair word phrase invoke even deeper meaning
As culture change word become loaded meaning
In America Communism carry lot negative weight
In Germany Nazi carry lot negative weight 卐 matter
The basic symbol word phrase may able defined dictionary true meaning word symbol state infinite growth ethereal hard pin
Symbolism language communication limited word
We use image painting sculpture music body language dance convey meaning
convey meaning
Tone context absence word silence convey meaning well
From simply matter using imagination think different way language work symbolic system
Language communication go far beyond basic dictionary definition word
Symbology heart communication
Our brain much complex language rely concise symbol carry complex meaning
The way weave symbol together along factor like intention context help convey idea concept
tagged It astounding even Symbols like male female symbol get short shrift
At time site writer mention language embeds
What say symbol name hardly ever fully understood
People take symbol developed century ago carry truth name symbol language MYTH
False
LIES
Well I agree symbol important
I really never thought baked male bias symbol sure worth looking
Still look symbol Tao astrology mythology thing like equal weight tends given male female
They considered equal part whole
Ideally take view sex America today
Simple symbol like carry lot weight meaning much deeper squiggly line implies meaning current society historic meaning well

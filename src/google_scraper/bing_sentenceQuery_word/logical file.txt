cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called

Propositional logic good vehicle introduce basic property logic
It provide mean determine validity truth false atomic statement
Instead allows evaluate validity compound statement given validity atomic component
For example consider following Accept fact first two statement noting use exclusive thus could really thought saying I like Pat I like Joe I like
Do statement imply I like Joe true
Try convince I like Joe true consider another line reasoning We see answer case
The two set statement abstracted follows Here concerned logical reasoning statement
Thus instead working pig Pats simply write We begin study first syntax propositional logic describe element language logic written
We describe semantics symbol symbol mean
The syntax propositional logic composed propositional symbol logical connective parenthesis
Rules govern element written together
First treat propositional symbol merely set symbol purpose use letter Roman Greek alphabet refer set symbol Second logical connective Note minimal required set equivalently represented using single connective NOR NAND used lowest level computer hardware
Finally use parenthesis denote expression later make parenthesis optional An string propositional symbol parenthesis logical connective
The expression consider called
The set formula smallest set expression Another way define formula language defined following grammar start symbol The context free grammar unambiguous
The function formula create meaning statement given meaning atomic statement
The semantics formula propositional symbol mapping associating truth assignment truth value
The truth value used instead respectively well abbreviation
The semantics well defined due Fact seen
One way specify semantics logical connective via truth table Can one always find formula implement given semantics
Yes truth table realized formula
The formula found follows
Represent row conjunction true proposition symbol negation false one
Finally write disjunction result
For example Every formula equivalent disjunction conjunction propositional symbol negation propositional symbol
Dual DNF
To get CNF There case DNF resp
CNF exponentially larger original formula
For example equivalent DNF exponential size
Does truth table polynomial size formula implementing
More precisely exist every truth table propositional symbol form size
Answer
Assume exists
The number truth table propositional symbol
The number formula size propositional symbol connective parenthesis
Clearly sufficiently large
TODO exposition explain definition provide context Note



It also possible prove directly
Special case SAT polynomial time
Example A disjunction literal one positive
There two kind possible Horn clause For every set Horn formula checking whether satisfiable
Let subset containing clause type subset containing clause type
Note first satisfiable
To obtain minimum satisfying assignment start literal clause crank rule
It remains check consistency clause
To enough check clause true
Consider set Horn clause The set clause type consists first clause consists last clause
Note also written The minimum satisfying assignment obtained follows Thus minimum satisfying assignment make true
This contradicts state must false
Thus satisfiable
A system mechanism proving new statement given statement
Let set known valid statement propositional formula
In deductive system two component inference rule proof
If proof using inference rule write
Natural deduction collection inference rule
Let denote contradiction falsity
The following inference rule natural deduction Rule allows u prove valid statement form If even know truth value statement set known valid statement
Indeed rule start assuming valid
If conclude valid world valid conclude relation true release assumption valid
We show apply inference rule
Example De Morgan Law negated say By rule prove infer desired result
To prove first direction use rule assume hypothesis
Then We prove second direction
Proof Pierce Law Natural deduction sound
To show natural deduction also complete need introduce propositional resolution
Resolution another procedure checking validity statement
It involves single rule
Some terminology A proof system resolution contains single resolution rule resolvent defined follows
Assume clause The smallest set clause containing closed resolution denoted
If
It possible show resolution rule defined computes clause inferred using natural deduction
Let two clause
Then
In order prove validity statement prove statement unsatisfiable
To prove unsatisfiability formula need define formula The resolution refutation tree formula tree rooted empty clause every leaf clause internal node computed resolvent two corresponding child
Notice clause appear repeated leaf
From claim conclude If exists resolution refutation tree formula unsatisfiable
The formula following resolution refutation tree The order clause selected compute resolvent matter computing resolution refutation tree following example show Consider formula Even though resolution refutation tree may exist order important trying build tree
Below two different resolution refutation tree one successful Propositional resolution sound exists resolution refutation tree given formula must unsatisfiable
For formula
Propositional resolution complete given formula unsatisfiable resolution refutation tree
For formula
By induction number variable
We one variable say
All possible clause
If unsatisfiable clause occur therefore
Suppose hypothesis true formula le variable
Let formula variable
Suppose show satisfiable
Let variable
Then either hold immediately
Assume
We define formula containing clause contain literal removed clause word equivalent formula resulting setting true
Formally First notice thus Also since
By induction hypothesis satisfiable
Then satisfiable extension satisfying assignment equal true
The case analogous
Let set inference rule Natural Deduction
If
The idea behind proof completeness natural deduction follows
Suppose valid unsatisfiable
We show exists resolution refutation applying contradiction rule rule conclude inferred
Sketch Given formula valid perform following step Step easily done repeated application De Morgan law
Step proven using natural deduction
Finally step proven induction number step obtain
Clearly step simulated using natural deduction
It likely algorithm propositional resolution take long worst case recall checking validity formula complete
Linear resolution particular resolution strategy always resolve recent resolvent clause
The resolution refutation tree obtained therefore linear
It possible prove set clause Horn clause exists linear resolution strategy formula
That linear resolution complete set Horn clause
The language PROLOG us resolution set Horn clause
Each clause called
Moreover clause composed single literal called
A clause single negated literal called
The table show comparison different notation
In PROLOG query statement idea negate statement perform resolution set known true statement
If resolution refutation tree found statement implied program
An example linear resolution formula shown

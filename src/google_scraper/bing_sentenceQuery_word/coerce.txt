In different way changing entity one another
An example would conversion value value textual representation vice versa
Type conversion take advantage certain feature
Two important aspect type conversion whether happens whether underlying data representation converted one representation another given representation merely representation another data type
In general converted
Each rule type converted
Languages typically little implicit conversion discourage reinterpretation representation language perform many implicit conversion data type
Weak typing language often allow forcing arbitrarily interpret data item different programming error technical method directly deal underlying hardware
In language word used denote conversion either compilation
For example expression mixing integer floating point number like compiler automatically convert integer representation floating point representation fraction lost
Explicit type conversion either indicated writing additional code
adding type identifier calling coding conversion routine compiler use otherwise would halt type mismatch
In language distinctly different concept
In language refers either implicitly explicitly changing value one data type storage format another
integer integer
The storage need may change result conversion including possible loss precision truncation
The word hand refers explicitly changing representing value one type another
For example contiguous bit may treated array booleans string unsigned integer IEEE single precision floating point value
Because stored bit never changed programmer must know low level detail representation format byte order alignment need meaningfully cast
In C family language word typically refers type conversion opposed implicit conversion causing ambiguity whether real data representation conversion
More important multitude way rule apply data type class located pointer pointer may adjusted compiler case like object class inheritance
Implicit type conversion also known automatic type conversion
Some allow compiler provide coercion others require
In expression data one supertype needed program run correctly
For example following legal code Although belong different data type automatically converted equal data type time comparison assignment executed
This behavior used caution unintended consequence arise
Data lost converting representation integer fractional component value truncated rounded toward zero
Conversely precision lost converting representation integer since type may unable exactly represent integer type
For example might single precision type represent integer exactly integer type
This lead unintuitive behavior demonstrated following code On compiler implement float IEEE single precision ints least bit code give peculiar Note represents equality last line
This odd behavior caused implicit conversion float compared
The conversion cause loss precision make value equal comparison
Important takeaway One special case implicit type conversion type promotion compiler automatically expands binary representation object integer type
Promotions commonly used type smaller native type target platform ALU arithmetic logical operation make operation possible efficient ALU work one type
C perform promotion object boolean character wide character enumeration short integer type promoted int object type float promoted double
Unlike type conversion promotion never lose precision modify value stored object
In Explicit type conversion type conversion explicitly defined within program instead done compiler implicit type conversion
It defined user program
There several kind explicit conversion
In language object also reference base class cast one derived class
In type conversion made safe unsafe manner former called
In similar effect achieved using
In notion type conversion integrated rule type system
The Assignment Rule say assignment valid type source expression case type target entity case
In rule mean type source expression either target
Conformance type defined familiar rule
For example assignment type conforms type class upon based descendant upon based
The action type conversion Eiffel specifically defined A type based class CU type T based class CT T U either Eiffel fully compliant Microsoft
Before development Eiffel already extensive class library
Using type library particularly commonly used type string pose conversion problem
Existing Eiffel software us string class Eiffel library Eiffel software written must use string class many case example calling method expect item type passed argument
So conversion type back forth need seamless possible
In code two string declared one different type Eiffel compliant alias
Because conform assignment valid convert
The Eiffel class conversion procedure object type
Conversion procedure also always designated creation procedure similar constructor
The following excerpt class The presence conversion procedure make assignment semantically equivalent constructed new object type content equivalent
To handle assignment original source target reversed class also contains conversion query produce instance
The assignment becomes equivalent In Eiffel setup type conversion included class code appears happen automatically client code
The includes assignment type attachment well argument parameter substitution
In typecasting misuse type conversion temporarily change data type originally defined
This provides opportunity hacker since type conversion variable typecast become different data type compiler treat hacked variable new data type specific operation

I seen term used almost interchangeably various online explanation text book I consulted also entirely clear distinction
Is perhaps clear simple way explaining difference guy know
also sometimes known To use value one type context expects another
sometimes known A change alter underlying bit
Process compiler automatically convert value one type value another type second type required surrounding context
The word refers either implicitly explicitly changing value one data type another
integer integer
The word used denote implicit conversion
The word typically refers explicit type conversion opposed implicit conversion regardless whether real conversion
So coercion implicit cast explicit conversion
Few example Usages vary note
My personal usage A cast usage
A cast operator instructs compiler either expression known given type I promise value type runtime compiler treat expression given type runtime produce error expression different type entirely way associate instance expression type instance type
The compiler instructed generate code performs conversion
The attentive reader note opposite I think neat trick
A conversion operation value one type treated value another type usually different type though identity conversion still conversion technically speaking
The conversion may representation changing like int double might representation preserving like string object
Conversions may implicit require cast explicit require cast
A coercion implicit conversion
Casting process treat object type another type Coercing converting one object another
Note former process conversion involved type would like treat another say example different object inherit base type method take base type point specific child type CAST use specific method property object create new instance object
On hand coercing implies creation new object memory new type original type would copied new one leaving object memory Garbage Collectors take either away
Below posting The difference coercion casting often neglected
I see many language similar syntax terminology operation
Some language may even refer conversion following explanation refers concept CTS
If trying assign value type location different type generate value new type similar meaning original
This coercion
Coercion let use new type creating new value way resembles original
Some coercion may discard data
converting int short others may
converting int short long
Recall value multiple type
If situation slightly different want select different one type casting tool job
Casting simply indicates wish operate particular type value includes
The difference code level varies C IL
In C casting coercion look fairly similar At IL level quite different As logical level important difference
important remember coercion creates new value casting
The identity original value value casting identity coerced value differs original value coersion creates new distinct instance casting
A corollary result casting original always equivalent identity equality coerced value may may equal original never share original identity
easy see implication coercion example numeric type always copied value
Things get bit trickier working reference type
In example one conversion cast coercion
After conversion tuple name equal string equal either
You could make situation slightly better slightly confusing implementing Equals operator Name class compare Name string
These operator would comparison issue would still two separate instance modification string would reflected name tuple change either one name tuple would reflected name tuple string
Although example meant illustrate difference casting coercion also serf great example extremely cautious using conversion operator reference type C

In series taking beginner look dynamically typed weakly typed language lack strong typing positively negatively impact programming
As mentioned series specifically geared towards beginner towards lot experience language
That say programming strongly typed weakly typed language familiar type coercion pitfall occur performing certain operation series may much interest
On hand someone getting started writing code someone coming dynamically typed language another language series geared specifically towards
Ultimately goal define type coercion show work examine pitfall
According Wikipedia defined follows Or perhaps simpler manner may define take one data type convert another
The thing fine line conversion coercion
As general rule thumb I tend think interpreter compiler work determine kind comparison made whereas explicit change type programmer write code
Let look detail
Let say example string named value
In statically typed language may type cast grab value string convert number different method
Assume object method
The method accepts string return value string integer data type
The code may look something like Of course syntax vary language language way go casting value give idea explicitly convert one type another
Another way go use type casting operator
Though implementation operation varies programmer worked language likely recognize something similar Generally speaking type casting usually done placing type want convert variable parenthesis variable
In example contain rather still hold
As stated something normally done within context compiled language This still leaf question type coercion differs type conversion
Though coercion happen within compiled language likely see happening within interpreted language dynamically typed language
Furthermore likely going see type coercion happening whenever comparison made object different type operation evaluate made variable different type
As simple example let say JavaScript two variable refers person name refers person age
The variable purpose example using simply denote one storing string one storing integer
Note argument Hungarian Notation topic another post
It used make clear type value variable stored easier follow code
So go ahead define variable value Now look example type coercion work within context interpreted language
Two example type coercion work follows Let take look example These example relatively simple
The first one make sense way number could compared boolean value
In second example notice taking string concatenating another set string also using number concatenation operation
In case number converted string concatenated along rest word
This type coercion When take variable one type convert value another type performing operation evaluation
The thing example simplistic
Let look demonstrate coercion work least JavaScript performing concatenation operation There two important thing note To take example one step let add one variable prioritized set operation examine result Notice second example together number result string
Earlier mentioned one special case number boolean value least JavaScript
And since language using examine type coercion since language frequently used modern web development let take look
In case JavaScript note considered truthy value concerned falsey value
These word chosen value serve number also evaluated performing comparison
Let take look basic example Notice example number value integer value nature comparison made
But happens compare boolean value string value
At point thing start get really confusing comparing string value number boolean value getting boolean result boolean
Make sense
We taking look bit detail next article I wanted go ahead introduce basic first
This dynamically typed language start cause headache developer
Luckily way write code stricter yield accurate result
Additionally dynamically typed language also contain value
These also maintain truthy falsey value turn affect deal comparison
In final article series going take look value compare value well one another take look strategy implement make code resilient incorrect type coercion make readable
If first foray dynamically typed language type coercion question comment feedback please hesitate leave comment feed

What common us Python function
I see applying I know numeric value common usage exist
I would guess also called performing arithmetic computation
It function presumably potential common usage
Its left basically make tuple number underlying number type
It also allow object act like number old class bad example usage would Python core programing say Function coerce provides programmer rely Python interpreter custom two numerical type conversion

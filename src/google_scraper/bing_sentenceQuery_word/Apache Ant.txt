Apache Ant Java library tool whose mission drive process described build file target extension point dependent upon
The main known usage Ant build Java application
Ant supply number task allowing compile assemble test run Java application
Ant also used effectively build non Java application instance C application
More generally Ant used pilot type process described term target task
Ant written Java
Users Ant develop antlibs containing Ant task type offered large number commercial antlibs
Ant extremely flexible impose coding convention directory layout Java project adopt build tool
Software development project looking solution combining build tool dependency management use Ant combination
The Apache Ant project part
Apache Ant available download source binary
The Apache Ant team currently maintains two line development
The release require runtime requires runtime
Both line based Ant release mostly bug fix release additional new feature developed
We recommend using unless required use version Java prior build process
Ant contains superset exception task feature longer work anyway like task

It similar make utility mainly functional Java platform
Unlike make Ant script written XML describe build process dependency
Portability simplicity use two main benefit Ant
Ant acronym another neat tool
Sometimes software described similar insect share name although ant small build large well
Ant commonly used project
It requires Java platform implemented using Java language
Ant build file easily transferred another platform inherit Java platform independency

Ever find boring repetitive task web developer
Today I going show cut development cycle little bit automation
In tutorial learn easily perform repetitive task
Every week revisit reader favorite post throughout history site
This tutorial first published March
Ant make incredibly easy define set task execute command
Ant piece software originally built automating software build
It made Apache yes Apache server primarily purpose build Java application
When building software case several task identical time build publish deploy project
It waste valuable time manually
Ant make incredibly easy define set task execute command terminal
Ready
Let Get started
Before get Ant need project work
Here file I using As see explains rest project
If download project link top get CSS JavaScript file
So going project
As see got multiple CSS JavaScript file linked project
What compile compress respective file FTP server
Before start installing Ant
Installing Ant rather daunting task
Thankfully Windows Mac installation process pretty similar
If Linux I going assume either Ant installed already know figure without
If Mac probably already Ant installed however advanced task case FTP work
So install latest version
Before begin I point full instruction Apache offer
Unfortunately whole manual Ant I better done frame
You see Installing Apache Ant link left frame
What I tell found besides version little friendly
First let make sure right Java dependency
Whether Windows Mac need Java Development Kit JDK least version
You
If sure version JDK run command terminal command line
As I understand JDK version number Java version number
Now let download latest version Ant
You get course compile roll
You find link page Once downloaded unzipped install
This get The first part installation differs platform
Let start Windows step First choose folder like install Ant
I went
Create folder move folder download folder folder
You also want move
Once done setup environmental variable
If sure Make system truthfully matter
This need set Now got Ant installed Windows
There one important step though skip pver Mac piece keep following along
You already got ant installed Mac see running command terminal
This output something along line path Ant executable use
However actually go folder find symlink real stuff
As see linked
Now could use I tried I able use FTP component
Rather install Ant somewhere else mess symlink I chose move folder subfolder called move new stuff
You move folder plus file
Now symlink point updated version ant
If run terminal see got version whatever version latest time reading
There one step finish installation
There several optional component come Ant need project may want use road
Let get
You start opening command line terminal changing directory installed Ant
More importantly directory put file
Now run command This download install quite optional component one command could take minute
Now got Ant installed ready run let get work
Ant us XML file store task current project
Ant us XML file store task current project project directory command line able run command find appropriate task within XML file execute
If familiar XML worry
XML stand eXtensible Markup Language similar HTML
It us tag attribute define data
Actually similar XHTML RIP rule strict tag attribute must lowercase value quoted doctype required etc
Don worry though get hang
The XML file Ant look default named want put project folder
So exactly going XML file
Here start Looks like HTML eh
The first line XML doctype
Next root node
I added two attribute explains list task defines default task run
See default task idea work
Let say create task called
We could run terminal If find time run Ant project calling task want make default
In case set default task one run tell ant run anything
These
Now got file let create first task
Tasks called within file
Check Plug file run console
You output look something like In output Ant entry task run
Then output task displayed tabbed appropriate task name
As see called task print whatever put inside
But I know echo task
Well get list task
This good time point many task several way called
For example could also done
What I show way thing
Now starting warm idea Ant let talk property
Ant property like variable programming language
As use Ant might find boilerplate file tweak slightly
One tweak might name
Ant property like variable programming language
You create way done inside task
You also move property separate file import file
That
This brings u creating first real task We called task
It involves two action first use task import file attribute
Then echo message saying successful
It simple
Of course need create file
This one use today You might think actually make harder variable name longer value
Well true give u flexibility use file make reusable shareable
Okay let get serious
We obviously got quite task create useful file
Here list task need create We going use different tactic give good overview Ant work
Let start compiling task take set file concatenate one file
Ant task named
I named task
Inside running task
As see file concatenated destination file
You notice I use property substitute correct value
You must wrap usage property notation
Inside task define This one way grab bunch file
I using allows define order I like file concatenated
I giving id give u access file set way use parameter although
It also attribute tell task folder find file
Then inside define appropriate node attribute holding filename
There first real task
Hopefully make sense
While JavaScript one different Compression get bit trickier built Ant
However Ant support outside task via java file
This incredibly handy u YUI Compressor available file way available
You download
You want save smart location maybe rename
I saved
Do plea
Now YUI Compressor compress JavaScript CSS
What create one task call two specific task
We Ant support calling task passing parameter
Let see work We using command
This similar running jar file command line
The attribute point jar file
If attribute true jar run Java virtual machine separate one Ant running
Then inside node define argument
On command line would pas
So thing
But property coming
From This CSS compression task
First notice node second attribute
You probably guess mean task depends task must run first
This way call automatically call first
Now going inside
We executing task simply call another task within case task
Inside create many parameter need name value
Yep much like calling function
This parameter use within task
And JavaScript version Don forget one dependant
Way back root set task
We created task yet let
This task depends two task one created yet use comma separated list require multiple task
Inside first task create asset directory task like command line
Next make two one compress CSS one compress JavaScript
Remember two task depend respective concatenation function call
Finally message letting user know done
What task depends
It pretty simple It merely deletes asset directory
This completely necessary might find useful
Let create one task want upload project server
Thanks command cinch
We calling task depends
We using FTP task
As see important info stored attribute
If worked FTP client option familiar
Once fill server information task upload file
Notice arranged task though
If run command line concatenate compress CSS JavaScript upload default
If want upload run since depends call first
Of course call individual task like example
Before close odds end I like mention And wrap
I hope learned new technique save time future
If question feel free post
Thank much reading

I want install SMSlib installation instruction
In I must install Apache Ant I understand
I already download Apache Ant read manual In I must RPM version right
I already go must I
I already try many link
I know witch one must I download If Windows use Windows installer Apache Ant I made
Download install Download Ant
Go click download binary
Because talking Windows choose download ZIP file rather others
Scroll say release click ZIP filename
Once downloaded unzip file
need choose permanent home Ant computer
often used put wherever want
Set environment variable To set environment variable Windows XP right click My Computer select Properties
Then go Advanced tab click Environment Variables button bottom
To set environment variable Windows right click Computer select Properties
Click Advanced System Settings click Environment Variables button bottom
The environment variable absolutely need tell Ant location JRE
If installed JDK likely Windows XP Windows
note space path cause problem
You need use mangled name instead complete name
So Windows XP use C Windows use C installed Program Files folder That alone enough get Ant work convenience good idea add Ant binary path PATH variable
This variable list directory search executables
To able run ant directory Windows need know location ant binary java binary
need add end PATH variable
For Windows XP likely add something like For Windows look something like Once done applied change need open new command prompt see variable set properly
You able simply run ant see something like That mean Ant installed properly looking file
You follow Download latest version ant Unzip save C directory ant
Add bin directory PATH environment variable
Add environment variable set C
use following command set variable C set C set C set C ant Apache Ant version compiled April java installed machine Add environment variable set
This need install ant machine
Download Unzip copy c Files Right Click My Computer property Advanced Environment variable Edit variable PATH append value C C Click OK
open cmd type ant checking
installation ant smslib pretty simple
All need extract directory
Export path case Linux set PATH variable access directory shell
root directory ant installed
For SMSLib Download zip file guide step step basis Sound like using Linux
If easiest way would use package management frontend like Synaptic install ant
Its simple install Apache ant installer window give link need set Environment automatically every thing

software tool process originated project early
It replacement build tool unix created due number problem unix make
It similar Make implemented using language requires Java platform best suited building Java project
The immediately noticeable difference Ant Make Ant us describe build process dependency whereas Make us
By default XML file named
Ant released
Ant Another Neat Tool conceived preparing engine later release
A version Make used build platform world way controlling platform used build Tomcat Ant created simple tool build Tomcat directive XML build file
Ant version officially released product July
Several proposal Ant version made AntEater James Duncan Davidson Myrmidon Mutant none able find large acceptance developer community
At one time Ant build tool used Java development project
For example open source Java developer include file distribution
Because Ant made trivial integrate test build process Ant made easy willing developer adopt even
one many example task extension written Ant
These extension installed copying file ant directory
Once done task extension invoked directly typical file
The WOProject extension allow developer use ant building framework apps instead using suite
provides collection task conditional statement operation property well useful task
implement task type networking user interface processing
Other task extension exist filesystem manipulation
Below listed sample file simple Java Hello world application
It defines four target associated description
The target list target dependency
This tell Ant start target must first complete target
Within target action Ant must take build target performed using task
For example build target Ant must first create directory called Ant already exist invoke Java compiler
Therefore task used
These perform similar task utility name
Another task used example named This Ant task name common Java utility JAR really call Ant program file support
This detail relevant end user get JAR wanted file asked
Many Ant task delegate work external program either native Java
They use Ant task set command line handle detail mapping information build file program argument interpreting return value
Users see task
trying execute task system without underlying program path without full Java Development Kit JDK installed
One primary aim Ant solve Make portability problem
The first portability issue Makefile action required create target specified command specific Make run
Different platform require different shell command
Ant solves problem providing large amount functionality designed behave platform
For example sample file target deletes directory everything
In Makefile would typically done command command unavailable environment
example would use In Ant build file goal would accomplished using command A second portability issue result fact symbol used delimit element file system directory path component differs one platform another
Unix us forward slash delimit component whereas Windows us backslash
Ant build file let author choose favorite convention forward slash backslash directory semicolon colon path separator
It convert symbol appropriate platform executes
There exists myriad Ant extension called provide much missing functionality
Also IDE build execute Ant script IDE us Ant internal build system
As IDEs popular development platform simplify Ant use significantly
As bonus Ant script generated NetBeans used outside IDE standalone script

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
Apache ANT estará disponible el

I would like specify classpath fpt task directly Ant Build script
I tried following The first approach give following error message The second approach give following error message Is possible set classpath build script ftp task I outside build script server
Would nice build script
Just ftp task classpath reference Have tried solution commented
I similar problem time ago I solved adding new classloader

A Apache Ant available
simply build scripting language used heavily Open Source community
Ant automates task compiling source code building deployment package automatically checking dependency item need updated build set
This wikibook based presentation created Minnesota
Dan felt strongly gentle introduction Ant necessary new people easily learn Ant
The existing Ant documentation although useful advanced Ant user meet need beginner
For example Apache documentation advanced concept token filter placed directly introduction beginner
The introductory material also contain full example complete sample build file expected output
Something else needed
At time introductory material assumed reader familiar XML
This material cover material need know XML build Ant script
This wikibook also designed work programming wikibooks
This document introduction page people getting started
Mostly hello world information get flavor Ant used
At end six section Ant used process XML document

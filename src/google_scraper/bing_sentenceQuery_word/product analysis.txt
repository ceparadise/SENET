In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

In statistical application data analysis divided EDA CDA
EDA focus discovering new feature data CDA confirming falsifying existing
focus application statistical model predictive forecasting classification applies statistical linguistic structural technique extract classify information textual source specie
All variety data analysis
precursor data analysis data analysis closely linked data dissemination
The term sometimes used synonym data modeling
Analysis refers breaking whole separate component individual examination
Data analysis obtaining raw data converting information useful user
Data collected analyzed answer question test hypothesis disprove theory
Statistician defined data analysis Procedures analyzing data technique interpreting result procedure way planning gathering data make analysis easier precise accurate machinery result mathematical statistic apply analyzing data
There several phase distinguished described
The phase iterative feedback later phase may result additional work earlier phase
The data necessary input analysis specified based upon requirement directing analysis customer use finished product analysis
The general type entity upon data collected referred experimental unit person population people
Specific variable regarding population age income may specified obtained
Data may numerical categorical text label number
Data collected variety source
The requirement may communicated analyst custodian data information technology personnel within organization
The data may also collected sensor environment traffic camera satellite recording device etc
It may also obtained interview downloads online source reading documentation
Data initially obtained must processed organised analysis
For instance may involve placing data row column table format analysis within spreadsheet statistical software
Once processed organised data may incomplete contain duplicate contain error
The need data cleaning arise problem way data entered stored
Data cleaning process preventing correcting error
Common task include record matching identifying inaccuracy data overall quality existing data deduplication column segmentation
Such data problem also identified variety analytical technique
For example financial information total particular variable may compared separately published number believed reliable
Unusual amount threshold may also reviewed
There several type data cleaning depend type data phone number email address employer etc
Quantitative data method outlier detection used get rid likely incorrectly entered data
Textual data spell checker used lessen amount mistyped word harder tell word correct
Once data cleaned analyzed
Analysts may apply variety technique referred begin understanding message contained data
The process exploration may result additional data cleaning additional request data activity may iterative nature
average median may generated help understand data
may also used examine data graphical format obtain additional insight regarding message within data
Mathematical formula model called may applied data identify relationship among variable
In general term model may developed evaluate particular variable data based variable data residual error depending model accuracy Data Model Error
includes technique measure relationship particular variable
For example may used model whether change advertising independent variable X explains variation sale dependent variable Y
In mathematical term Y sale function X advertising
It may described Y aX b error model designed b minimize error model predicts Y given range value X
Analysts may attempt build model descriptive data simplify analysis communicate result
A data product computer application take data input generates output feeding back environment
It may based model algorithm
An example application analyzes data customer purchasing history recommends purchase customer might enjoy
Once data analyzed may reported many format user analysis support requirement
The user may feedback result additional analysis
As much analytical cycle iterative
When determining communicate result analyst may consider technique help clearly efficiently communicate message audience
Data visualization us table chart help communicate key message contained data
Tables helpful user might lookup specific number chart bar chart line chart may help explain quantitative message contained data
Author Stephen Few described eight type quantitative message user may attempt understand communicate set data associated graph used help communicate message
Customers specifying requirement analyst performing data analysis may consider message course process
Author Jonathan Koomey recommended series best practice understanding quantitative data
These include For variable examination analyst typically obtain mean average
They may also analyze key variable see individual value cluster around mean
The consultant named technique breaking quantitative problem component part called
Each layer broken component must add layer
The relationship referred Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive MECE
For example profit definition broken total revenue total cost
In turn total revenue analyzed component revenue division A B C mutually exclusive add total revenue collectively exhaustive
Analysts may use robust statistical measurement solve certain analytical problem
used particular hypothesis true state affair made analyst data gathered determine whether state affair true false
For example hypothesis might Unemployment effect inflation relates economics concept called
Hypothesis testing involves considering likelihood relate whether data support accepting rejecting hypothesis
may used analyst trying determine extent independent variable X affect dependent variable Y To extent change unemployment rate X affect inflation rate Y
This attempt model fit equation line curve data Y function X
NCA may used analyst trying determine extent independent variable X allows variable Y To extent certain unemployment rate X necessary certain inflation rate Y
Whereas multiple regression analysis us additive logic produce outcome X compensate sufficient necessary necessary condition analysis NCA us necessity logic one allow outcome exist may produce necessary sufficient
Each single necessary condition must present compensation possible
Users may particular data point interest within data set opposed general messaging outlined
Such user analytic activity presented following table
The taxonomy also organized three pole activity retrieving value finding data point arranging data point
Barriers effective analysis may exist among analyst performing data analysis among audience
Distinguishing fact opinion cognitive bias innumeracy challenge sound data analysis
Effective analysis requires obtaining relevant answer question support conclusion formal test
Facts definition irrefutable meaning person involved analysis able agree upon
For example August CBO estimated extending time period would add approximately trillion national debt
Everyone able agree indeed CBO reported examine report
This make fact
Whether person agree disagree CBO opinion
As another example auditor public company must arrive formal opinion whether financial statement publicly traded corporation fairly stated material respect
This requires extensive analysis factual data evidence support opinion
When making leap fact opinion always possibility opinion
There variety adversely affect analysis
For example tendency search interpret information way confirms one preconception
In addition individual may discredit information support view
Analysts may trained specifically aware bias overcome
In book retired CIA analyst wrote analyst clearly delineate assumption chain inference specify degree source uncertainty involved conclusion
He emphasized procedure help surface debate alternative point view
Effective analyst generally adept variety numerical technique
However audience may literacy number said innumerate
Persons communicating data may also attempting mislead misinform deliberately using bad numerical technique
For example whether number rising falling may key factor
More important may number relative another number size government revenue spending relative size economy GDP amount cost relative revenue corporate financial statement
This numerical technique referred normalization
There many technique employed analyst whether adjusting inflation comparing real nominal data considering population increase demographic etc
Analysts apply variety technique address various quantitative message described section
Analysts may also analyze data different assumption scenario
For example analyst perform often recast financial statement different assumption help arrive estimate future cash flow discount present value based interest rate determine valuation company stock
Similarly CBO analyzes effect various policy option government revenue outlay deficit creating alternative future scenario key measure
A data analytics approach used order predict energy consumption building

The important distinction initial data analysis phase main analysis phase initial data analysis one refrain analysis aimed answering original research question
The initial data analysis phase guided following four question The quality data checked early possible
Data quality assessed several way using different type analysis frequency count descriptive statistic mean standard deviation median normality skewness kurtosis frequency histogram n variable compared coding scheme variable external data set possibly corrected coding scheme comparable
The choice analysis ass data quality initial data analysis phase depends analysis conducted main analysis phase
The quality checked initial data analysis phase focus research question study
One check whether structure measurement instrument corresponds structure reported literature
There two way ass measurement NOTE one way seems listed After assessing quality data measurement one might decide impute missing data perform initial transformation one variable although also done main analysis phase
Possible transformation variable One check success procedure instance checking whether background substantive variable equally distributed within across group
If study need use randomization procedure one check success sampling instance checking whether subgroup population interest represented sample
Other possible data distortion checked In report article structure sample must accurately described
It especially important exactly determine structure sample specifically size subgroup subgroup analysis performed main analysis phase
The characteristic data sample assessed looking During final stage finding initial data analysis documented necessary preferable possible corrective action taken
Also original plan main data analysis specified detail rewritten
In order several decision main data analysis made Several analysis used initial data analysis phase It important take measurement level variable account analysis special statistical technique available level Nonlinear analysis necessary data recorded
Nonlinear system exhibit complex dynamic effect including analyzed using simple linear method
Nonlinear data analysis closely related
In main analysis phase analysis aimed answering research question performed well relevant analysis needed write first draft research report
In main analysis phase either exploratory confirmatory approach adopted
Usually approach decided data collected
In exploratory analysis clear hypothesis stated analysing data data searched model describe data well
In confirmatory analysis clear hypothesis data tested
interpreted carefully
When testing multiple model high chance finding least one significant due
It important always adjust significance level testing multiple model example
Also one follow exploratory analysis confirmatory analysis dataset
An exploratory analysis used find idea theory test theory well
When model found exploratory dataset following analysis confirmatory analysis dataset could simply mean result confirmatory analysis due resulted exploratory model first place
The confirmatory analysis therefore informative original exploratory analysis
It important obtain indication generalizable result
While hard check one look stability result
Are result reliable reproducible
There two main way Many statistical method used statistical analysis
A brief list four popular method Different company organization hold data analysis contest encourage researcher utilize data solve particular question using data analysis
A example international data analysis contest follows

Tools analysis useful study many problem theoretical computer science
Perhaps surprisingly many case discrete feature problem allow application sophisticated analytical tool
A seminal example phenomenon use inequality analysis Boolean function first demonstrated Kahn Kalai Linial
Results discrete analysis play important role hardness approximation computational learning computational social choice communication complexity
The goal program bring together mathematician computer scientist study influence measure complexity discrete function functional inequality invariance principle norm representation theory modern topic mathematical analysis application theoretical computer science

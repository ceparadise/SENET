In often abbreviated TAC used aid implementation
Each TAC instruction three operand typically combination assignment binary operator
For example
The name derives use three operand statement even though instruction fewer operand may occur
Since code used intermediate language within compiler operand likely concrete memory address rather symbolic address translated actual address
It also uncommon operand name numbered sequentially since code typically generated compiler
A refinement code ANF
In code would broken several separate instruction
These instruction translate easily
It also easier detect shortening code
In following example one calculation composed several smaller one code may conditional unconditional jump method accessing memory
It may also method calling function may reduce jump
In way code may useful
In following example loop store square number

In single operation defined processor
The size length instruction varies widely little many multiple VLIW system
Most modern processor used instruction size bit
In architecture especially instruction fixed length typically corresponding architecture
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifying operation performed add content memory register zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous operation operand specified single instruction
Instructions rarely specified using form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
There another general definition instruction related processor An instruction may representation element executable

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
common topic many CS theory
I encountered studying Compiler Design
According Wikipedia article say Each TAC instruction three operand typically combination assignment binary operator
Now query mean I assign variable another variable operand even change thing action violates exact meaning TAC three operand
Example clarity In line I violated TAC rule operand first line I assigned three variable three different operand even required
Now technically considered wrong
I know inefficient wrong technical term
What I think wrong code optimization stage come filtration required
Still I want know opinion
Three address code intermediate language used internally compiler
What right depends specific rule compiler
Efficiency state normally issue intermediate language designed easy massaging ultimately traslating efficient target code

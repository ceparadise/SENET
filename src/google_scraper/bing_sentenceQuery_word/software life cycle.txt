The Life Cycle Typical Computer Program The People Who Bring Web App Life Research Sources Coding Your Own App Getting Ready Code
Do These Things First Dealing Dates Your Data Related Book By Few program written released left alone
Instead program tend go various cycle get updated continuously company sell newer version new existing customer
Generally typical program go development cycle first create release maintenance cycle eliminate glaring bug quickly possible upgrade cycle give program new feature justify selling thing
Every program begin blank screen somebody computer
During development cycle nurture program idea actual working program
The following step make development cycle
Come idea program

Decide probable identity typical user program

Decide computer program run

Pick one computer language use

Design program using pseudocode tool outline structure program

Write program

Test program
Step known alpha testing

Fix problem discover alpha testing
Repeat Steps often possible

Give copy program people test
Step known beta testing
The idea let total stranger use program tell like dislike
If give program friend relative test might overlook problem want hurt feeling
Strangers likely objective evaluating program

Fix problem people discover beta testing
Repeat Steps often possible

Release program unsuspecting public pray work advertised
Most programmer prefer creating new program maintaining modifying existing one prove unappealing cleaning somebody else mess apartment
But number new program programmer create every year far le number existing program point life likely maintain update program either somebody else wrote month year even decade ago
The following list describes typical step may need follow maintain existing program
Verify report problem bug determine part program may causing bug appear

Fix bug

Test program make sure bug really gone change make program introduce new bug

Fix problem occur testing

Repeat Steps bug someone report program
Given buggy nature software step may go continuously year

Release software patch user add existing version program incorporate correction make patch problem
Companies make money fixing software making stable reliable dependable
Instead company make money selling new version program offer additional feature option people probably use need even want first place
Still many program undergo modification take advantage new hardware software may find occasionally upgrading program adding new feature
The following step make upgrade cycle
Determine new feature want add program

Plan new feature work using pseudocode another tool help structure idea

Modify program add new feature

Test new feature using alpha testing make sure work introduce new bug program

Fix problem occur alpha testing

Give copy program people beta test

Fix problem beta tester report

Repeat Steps new feature need add program

Release program new version wait public start reporting bug keep program working correctly start maintenance cycle
Despite university course title software engineer programming still le science art
Writing modifying updating software require high IQ advanced mathematics degree much requires creativity determination plenty imagination
You write program way want best way prevent possible problem later organized methodical approach

The last decade theoretical computer science witnessed use analytical tool study property several type discrete object
Results discrete analysis play important role area diverse hardness approximation computational learning computational social choice communication complexity
A seminal example phenomenon classical paper demonstrates use hypercontractive inequality study Boolean function
Another example use Fourier analysis study optimal inapproximability result shown Håstad
A recent example majority stablest theorem Mossel Oleszkiewicz studied context understanding approximability MAXCUT problem
The Simons Institute program brought together many expert computer science mathematics probability statistic study related phenomenon mathematical analysis application theoretical computer science
This program one first program along parallel program Big Data organized new Institute Fall
The program kickstarted workshop application real analysis testing learning inapproximability
This first week program spent identifying challenge learning computational complexity hardness approximation could explicitly expressed discrete analytic term
The program participant consisted diverse set researcher various field computer science mathematics also various stage career senior graduate student postdoctoral fellow senior researcher
To acquaint diverse set participant key theme program well set common vocabulary first workshop followed boot camp second week September
The boot camp consisted three mini course Inapproximability Constraint Satisfaction Problems Johan Håstad Analytic Methods Supervised Learning Adam Klivans Introduction Analysis Discrete Cube Krzysztof Oleszkiewicz
This followed second workshop Functional Inequalities Discrete Spaces Applications first week October
The focus workshop spectral inequality logarithmic Sobolev inequality inequality discrete setting application
The Real Analysis Day organized immediately following FOCS conference featured detailed version four topical result conference
The final workshop held first week December Methods Discrete Analysis
The topic covered workshop Fourier analysis representation theory technique technique additive combinatorics emphasis emerging topic yet explored detail
Nati Linial Johan Håstad gave Open Lectures respectively
These workshop lecture accompanied graduate course Analysis Boolean Functions offered Gil Kalai weekly real analysis seminar attended program participant
In summary Real Analysis program Simons Institute provided exciting forum exchange idea intensive collaboration among mathematician CS theorist ranging senior leader field large vibrant community postdoctoral fellow

In last post I explained agile software development methodology work completed sprint
Although sprint meeting every week helpful important team member meeting clearly review key information factor contributed successful completion task deterrent successful program completion
This exactly agile sprint retrospective
In blog post going examine agile sprint retrospective important
Sprint retrospective meeting help agile team stay track project development process
It held end current sprint start following sprint
Retrospectives attended team member project manager note taker facilitator
The facilitator act like neutral person facilitate lead meeting team able make important decision end meeting
Derby Larsen According Mahnic Zabkar retrospective main topic discussion size code product backlog item total number product backlog item completed total number product backlog item pending
Unlike Scrum meeting fifteen minute long Sutherland Schwaber claim retrospective four hour long Hossain Babar Paik
Due length meeting participation multiple onshore offshore member often difficult find reliable form communication
Hence meeting sometimes held synchronous format video call time held asynchronous format posting result Wikis
Hossain Babar Paik After sprint retrospective team I realized important
The agile sprint retrospective important help increasing efficiency agile allowing team ensure continuous progress
After team first sprint retrospective concluded manner split task effective planning next phase
The identification hindrance allowed team function effectively following sprint
How retrospective help team increase efficiency
Firstly retrospective help team determine amount work required accomplish goal develop timeline project
Secondly meeting facilitator help team generate discussion help determining done increase functionality team
Such discussion also help determining root cause problem occurred identifying factor contributed successful completion task
Finally retrospective help team celebrate past achievement encouraged future project
Kerth From experience I realized couple important thing retrospective worth noting
When retrospective I noted sometimes team member identify different issue root cause problem
It important team come agreement root cause way team rectify issue
But agreeing something mean team one vote impose idea majority minority
Coming agreement long process involves lot interaction discussing various issue conducting multiple vote
During retrospective happened team concludes everything worked perfectly sprint nothing need changed
Although absolutely fine team consider perfect team able improve identify part improve
When lack discussion like question helped team identify feature improve upon Is client happy way interacted
Did provide update constantly
Was lack coordination team
Did different team member request information client multiple time
Did plan properly
Did correctly set sprint goal
Did overestimate underestimate task
What difficult issue deal time
How avoid issue next time
These question usually stir discussion required retrospective
If one opinion everyone agrees opinion team fail identify obstacle success
Our team able improve every sprint increase efficiency able correctly identify deterrent
As long retrospective held properly keeping point mind I believe help increasing efficiency team great extent
The last thing note Kerth suggests every group different dynamic important design retrospective manner fit team culture dynamic
Hence suggestion I made might work team
So make sure design team retrospective suit unique team
In post tried understand agile sprint retrospective contributes efficiency agile
We realized agile retrospective meeting extremely important retrospect team learn important lesson future
Although retrospective might difficult design retrospective designed properly suit team team able see great result
In next post I going explain agile task list important

An agile retrospective type planning session typically done one stage agile software development process around event like software release
In planning session participated agile development process evaluate process carefully think method may worked better others continuously improve design process going forward
Because agile retrospective look collaboration various developer IT professional many meeting much
It generally important get right people involved
For example meeting include someone responsibility large number code module contributed quite bit overall design may really accomplish objective without person input
In addition getting right people together expert agile development recommend establishing specific focus agile retrospective
This mean collecting specific data presenting team declaring issue specific process limit
This help ensure agile retrospective stay track address issue particular project
Team member bring data table brainstorm make actionable future

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

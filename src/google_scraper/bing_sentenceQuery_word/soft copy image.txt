Contents Today type readable writable data shaped two different form
Either form soft copy form hard copy
The basic purpose two presentation storage written material data
The purpose article draw fine line hard copy soft copy clear mind reader confusion term
The term hard copy mean something touchable physical tangible soft copy mean data information stored kind digital memory
The term hard copy describes something touchable physical tangible
And copy mean result production information
So collective meaning hard copy production record information physical object form
Printed book newspaper magazine document etc
kind hard copy
Hard copy older way keeping record physical form
Although technology changed still old gold
Property paper contract agreement signed document still required kept physical form hard copy prove page book computer printout likewise page printout best example hard copy
It considered old way representing data still widely used medium data information modern world
The term hard copy sometimes also used computing purpose well
But make clear punched paper tape diskette CDs kind magnetic tape considered hard copy
The hard copy highly associated printing newspaper book likewise printout
Despite fact many advantage using hard copy system gradually decreasing involves huge cost wastage time
You easily share hard copy case original one anyone living country
In case giving another hard copy document anyone mean printing cost
But still hard copy generally accepted authentic medium information
In case validity document signature taken hard format document
Soft copy mean data information stored kind digital memory
It intangible form preserving material
You see record touch
Monitors others display screen used see soft copy result
Soft copy latest form preserving material information digital form
With invention computer concept soft copy came existence
Among lot advantage soft copy two main advantage soft copy anytime send data via email preserve data without actual physical place
In short get rid courier service bulky hard copy stored printed physical paper rather available form digital document file like digital text format image format presentation format
PDF doc file xlx file presentation file etc
best example soft copy
Instead viewing via physical medium accessed database program word processing program presentation program subject format file data
These transferred one PC operating system another PC operating system USB drive external disk drive online sharing downloading
There many advantage using soft copy make environment office paperless
But credibility soft document still stake
Despite fact digital signature system introduced still signature fixed soft copy regarded genuine one authenticate credibility document
Required field marked powerful information good information

Difference Between Things Terms Objects Posted Last updated September These day bank ask account holder whether want hard copy soft copy bank statement
Internet Service Provider cajole customer accept soft copy bill rather pressing hard copy
So difference hard copy soft copy
This article take closer look two type document file remove confusion mind reader
The term soft copy came existence advent computer
It electronic version file digitalized seen read sent form others easily
Before mail computer even one type document specific word refer
But soft copy coming existence physical form file document labeled hard copy
So getting statement credit card mail printed paper availing hard copy bill
If insist statement sent credit card company email ID desire soft copy easily stored computer
However read soft copy special software installed computer word processor database program
Soft copy document preferred world eliminate need paper ink two object held responsible environmental pollution
Less paper used always good environment paper manufacture requires felling tree
One manipulate soft copy carry along USB drive pen drive
One even send receive soft copy wherever part world provided internet connection
For office even individual soft copy invaluable save much needed space also managed easily retrieved click button
Hard copy physical version document one hold feel hand unlike soft copy electronic read computer monitor
However possible convert soft copy hard copy printer disposal
Soft copy document save space paper considered superior hard copy One carry soft copy place also receive send soft copy provided internet connection
Soft copy electronic digital version document hard copy physical tangible

The move reading prompted new interest image quality standard
While CRTs monitor clinically comparable flat panel tend last longer
Brightness contrast play equally important role image quality
display run continuous background check image quality regular operation
And
The ubiquity viewer tied today PACS teleradiology system allows image read anywhere anytime
But image quality maintained palmtop home desktop radiology reading room
As department shift filmless reading environment ensuring image display highest quality become hot issue among standard organization vendor
Associations National Electrical Manufacturers Association American Association Physicists Medicine among others drafting image quality guideline image
PACS teleradiology vendor OEMs specialize display component introduced new generation calibration quality control product display
Standards also development specifically digital mammography image quality interpretation see related article
From image processing tool graphic controller variety software hardware component control image quality
The influential component display monitor
Whether traditional cathode ray tube CRT display increasingly popular liquid crystal display LCD monitor used performance measured luminance contrast resolution sharpness uniformity across display
Another quality factor dependability
An image look monitor connected network
The existing standard applied image developed American College Radiology digital image data management
Revised June standard address host technical operational issue display part
Display workstation able perform following function The standard longer maintains x monitor necessity interpretation display system need adhere minimum luminance standard
That appropriate given application interpretation many department routinely rely x monitor interpretation
Studies comparing spatial resolution CRTs found accuracy x monitor equal monitor
Moreover type diagnostic image demand viewing using x monitor according Joseph Marion executive director Superior Consultants Ann Arbor MI
The interpretation computed radiography digital mammography image example may benefit x monitor
But image CT viewing protocol involves bringing stack image lower resolution monitor work well said
From beginning CRTs suffered comparison film CRTs used today improved greatly device
While average light box luminance range current CRTs use medical imaging range well ACR standard
But CRTs reached performance high LCD flat panel arrived scene
At last year RSNA meeting BarcoView Dome two technology leader diagnostic display imaging PACS vendor introduced flat panel
BarcoView Coronis monitor digital imaging board provides bit gray scale
The company released display system September offer complete range digital system resolution
Spurred promise improved brightness life span uniformity resolution many department upgrading diagnostic workstation traditional CRT display LCD monitor
At Computer Assisted Radiology Surgery CARS meeting last year panel radiologist consultant predicted display would replace CRTs medicine within next five year
In addition potential reduce distortion eye fatigue LCD flat panel may advantage improved cost performance enhancement compared CRTs Marion said
The benefit flat panel term space heat requirement uniformity may potentially outweigh advantage CRT said
But take monochromatic solution effective term diagnostic application
People starting lean toward flat panel performance advantage
The two type display comparable clinically
In study presented Symposium Computer Applications Radiology May researcher Baltimore VA Medical Center found LCD monitor equal CRTs sensitivity specificity average interpretation time confidence diagnosis
Although flat panel still expensive may cheaper CRTs long run average life span CRT two year
In another study presented SCAR researcher Texas Children Hospital reported CRT monitor required replacement one year use
Expensive x monitor vulnerable Two required replacement use month
By contrast x monitor needing replacement boasted average life span nearly three year
Display vendor marketing monitor say display designed last hour three five year
An automatic function could extend product life even
LCD monitor boast inherent advantage CRTs come life span
But advantage CRTs also potential disadvantage said David Hirschorn fellow radiology informatics MRI Harvard Medical School Massachusetts General Hospital
CRTs shoot electron beam phosphorus screen cause burst light emitted screen Hirschorn said
If run screen high brightness burn screen image blurred
The brighter run shorter life span
On LCD reverse true
An LCD sport bright light back panel
It easy make display bright
The way LCD monitor produce black filtering light pixel
The challenge according Hirschorn making black enough
The bottom line come quality display said ratio black white
Is problem make display bright enough make black enough
It
How many different shade gray display eye
The answer much high go low difference two
As part work research fellow informatics MGH Hirschorn also studying potential viability monitor reading
The issue could controversial fly face ACR standard luminance
But Hirschorn argues standard make distinction image luminance requirement possibly unnecessarily
They already identified exception
Because subtle contrast inherent computed radiography digital mammography monitor continue needed reading modality said
Consultant Marion added radiologist also take account inherent limitation viewing image color monitor
There definitely degradation image viewed color monitor versus monochrome said
You get pay
Whether radiologist read study palmtop desktop image quality remains top concern
Both monitor CRTs degrade time requiring routine monitoring recalibration headache PACS administrator
DICOM defined standard contrast curve standard display function DICOM part different type display device calibrated
With display calibrated standard ensure image look viewed different workstation different time
With new emphasis quality control major manufacturer addressing solution
BarcoView example introduced new functionality networked quality control system monitor called PIN product intelligence
The system enables PACS administrator check monitor calibration remotely display linked via local area network
PIN relies company sensor automatically monitor calibration eliminating need use manual light meter test display luminance
integrated display system provide constant monitoring LCD backlight stabilization
Unlike backlight sensor look front radiologist see
Data collected using sent remote location information viewed PACS administrator
The data also analyzed MediCal BarcoView quality assurance display management software
PACS administrator send command monitor recalibrate needed
The entire PIN process invisible using workstation application continue flow normally
Such automated solution may prove helpful department practice lack dedicated PACS administrator provide quality control regular basis Marion said
Automated QC also help solve recurring problem medical imaging display end user manipulation
The human element big factor display quality
People like fool control said
Some like adjust brightness contrast image suit personal preference
But lot misunderstanding correctly set monitor
The automate better

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

way data stored efficient search retrieval
Different data structure suited different problem
Some data structure useful simple general problem retrieving data stored specific identifier
For example online dictionary structured retrieve definition word
On hand specialized data structure devised solve complex specific search problem
The simplest data structure linear array stored element numbered consecutive content accessed number
Data item stored nonconsecutively memory may linked pointer memory address stored item indicate next item item structure located
Many developed sorting data efficiently apply structure residing main memory also structure information system
data structure may incorporate element simpler data structure
commonly use
development optimal algorithm inserting deleting locating data constituted major area theoretical computer science since beginning heavy use structure virtually computer compiler operating system file system
parallel machine
A major area study computer science storage data efficient search retrieval
The main memory computer linear consisting sequence memory cell numbered Whereas control structure organize algorithm data structure organize information
In particular data structure specify type data thus operation performed eliminating need programmer keep track memory address
Simple data structure positive negative number
The integer generated set counting number


operation subtraction
When counting number subtracted result zero
When larger number subtracted smaller systematic procedure finite number answer question solution problem

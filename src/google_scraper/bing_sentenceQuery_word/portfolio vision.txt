This page constitutes required learning portfolio Computer Vision taken Fall
In I discus I learned throughout course activity finding I think I impact
I coffee fanatic computer photography computer vision computational photography electronics
I currently working toward Master Degree Computer Science Georgia Tech
My passion using GPUs computer vision I also software engineer people make GPU Matlab
Foundation Reading Assignments In course completed several assignment foundation computer vision reading relevant material textbook
There three I chose research problem supposed relevant future career
For three project I proposed solution implemented described paper
collaborator Our purpose project propose evaluate set metric comparing various combination OpenCV feature pair domain specific video ant bee
Of metric used one clearly illustrates feature performance percentage correctly tracked feature
We learned examining frequency incorrect assignment useful level incorrectness comparing feature also choice detector impact performance choice descriptor
We saw test SURF detector consistently ranked well metric making robust detector tested
We also got nice intuition detector descriptor work hood watching controlled manner
In project implement compare two different optical flow algorithm GPU using OpenCL norm Total Variation optical flow
The method relatively simple fast produce larger single pixel error capture large motion well
For flow computed coarse image optimization formulation problem propagated initial estimate next pyramid level iterative solving
Increasing number pyramid level performance costly increasing number inner iteration pyramid involve memory transfer overhead
While alternative formulation problem lead robust solution probably important improvement approach standard inclusion image pyramid handle larger scale motion median filter remove outlier
Our original premise project could efficiently compute using GPU using HOG feature would improve classification performance
Unfortunately able show former project
Our implementation HOG feature descriptor run real time second compute HOG feature cell bin per histogram frame consumer laptop
Our naive sliding window approach classification quite simple slower hoped
Although made attempt given time frame unable get SVM train properly limited dataset detecting face
A neat visualization made showing cell dominant histogram orientation canonical HOG display live webcam input
Overall project presented u unique challenge opportunity learn
I feel group I performed well every project especially given time constraint u multiple class project due
The important lesson learn project effectively plan manage given time period complete project
The first project originally warm turned quite involved interesting
Of three second project far coolest paper implement demo
The last project also fun impressive demo show even though get extra step working
Determining optical flow pattern apparent motion object caused relative motion observer object scene fundamental problem computer vision
Given two image goal compute motion field projection velocity surface point onto imaging surface
Optical flow used wide range higher level computer vision task object tracking robot navigation motion estimation image stabilization
There real need shortening required computational time optical flow use practical application robotics motion analysis security system
With advance utilizing GPUs general computation become feasible use accurate computationally expensive optical flow algorithm practical application
With mind propose implement improved based optical flow GPU
Graphical Processing Units GPUs originally developed fast rendering computer graphic recently high level language CUDA OpenCL enabled GPU computation
This useful In field computer vision pattern recognition demonstrate implementing method GPUs using OpenCL
Two well known variational approach computing optical flow point based method presented Horn Schunck local patch based method Lucas Kanade
Our approach improvement replaces squared measure error norm
The highly nature solution lends well GPU implementation
The standard algorithm minimizes following energy equation first integral known regularization term second data term
An iterative solution optimization problem given two equation term flow field weighted local average flow gradient image respectively small constant close zero
These two equation come solving Lagrangian optimization equation associated energy function using finite difference approximation Laplacian flow
The approach optimizes following equation replaces squared error term norm
Wedel et al
propose iterative solution alternatively update flow auxiliary variable v Where current residual
On top alternative optimization implement median filter flow field use image pyramid approach order handle larger scale motion
That flow computed coarse image propagated initial estimate next pyramid level
In algorithm several point iterative solution flow vector individual pixel image computed concurrently neighbor
This allows u improve performance serial implementation using
In particular wrote OpenCL kernel compute flow update image gradient local flow average well kernel u v update discrete forward backward difference
Side note The first version code Matlab ported GPU matrix library
Porting code Matlab LibJacket almost easy
Good performance obtained almost using LibJacket v writing scratch kernel
We ran algorithm subset dataset
We compute list average maximum endpoint error pixel algorithm dataset
For table ran iteration
More iteration showed minimal improvement
ran fixed point iteration used pyramid image scaling factor
The figure illustrate effect number fixed point iteration size image pyramid used
performs better almost case
The difference two method clearly seen setting largest apparent motion group
Since make use image pyramid able capture larger motion make sense
Our testing also show method produce larger single pixel error make sense method applies median filter throw outlier
The parameter used test give roughly number iteration method us fixed iteration performs fixed point iteration pyramid level
By altering ratio fixed point iteration pyramid level performance algorithm particular dataset change given budget iteration
By increasing number pyramid level algorithm capture larger motion increasing fixed point iteration improves flow estimate pyramid level
The figure show accuracy trade
Performance wise increasing number pyramid level costly increasing number inner iteration pyramid involve memory transfer overhead
Looking back entire project one important lesson learned alternative formulation optimization problem lead robust solution probably important improvement approach standard inclusion image pyramid handle larger scale motion median filter remove outlier
The purpose implementing algorithm GPU achieve performance gain standard serial version
Our first naive implementation algorithm made use global memory computation could certainly improved future work
An obvious future work item would optimize naive OpenCL kernel make use memory
Our current implementation approach running Venus image setting mentioned previously
Additionally developed separate implementation using LibJacket library GPU matrix library improved running time serial CPU implementation order magnitude indeed nears performance
So much new cool stuff topic I find interesting learned lot optical flow work wrote first program OpenCL first time implementing using image pyramid actually produced fast GPU optical flow Going project pretty much Hey I heard topic I would like know let try X knowing slightest actually X
extreme focus ensues
Then come paper review day project due since dived deep selected project topic literature implmeneted written neat demo ready show presentation day
Every project taught least new thing
After Project I know feature pair OpenCV best suited task
After Project I know program OpenCL better understanding one top performing optical flow method running GPU
After Project I OpenCL experience deep understanding GPU implementation HOG feature descriptor
Getting choose interesting topic made project fly hmm week deadline
I feel proud second project mainly cool demo GPU optical flow laptop I never used OpenCL got learn fast put good use
The first project still interesting useful know nonetheless
While propose last project would better could gotten SVM trained properly face detection even impressive demo
All project took lot focused effort small amount time
Overall I got quite lot course learning topic top professor field GaTech getting intense project action interesting topic
I enjoyed involved project flexibility choose topic related computer vision helped group thing find interesting
I glad I signed course
Even though topic covered completely new gap literature I subject discussed filled I gained insight perspective topic I already familiar

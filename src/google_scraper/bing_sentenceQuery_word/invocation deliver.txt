I currently reading book Daniel Solis called Illustrated C
The book say When method called invoked What difference two term
Ultimately identical
The difference performance benefit
If directly call method compiler generate necessary code look method start address object virtual table push parameter onto stack invoke method
The runtime ultimately responsible dealing vtable change depending object used
Highly optimized fast given modern processor
This ideal mechanism use
The problem must know compilation time type referenced method name signature
This formally known early binding
If method information change code wo compile
Normally problem sometimes important
This invoke come
Invoke commonly used UI code
In UI code fundamental rule Windows interact UI thread created UI
Therefore want talk UI secondary thread worker thread must marshal call correct thread
Note applies event well
They really nothing method invocation
The method inherited WinForm control allows call arbitrary method UI thread
The method handle process marshalling request correct thread calling Invoke method
This still even though know advance method wanted call
Function calling call function program
While function invoking get called automatically
For example consider program Here line executed function constructor
invoked
When line executed function sum called
source web From research personal unpaid looking common way term used programming literature wild I found definition seem fit usage
Execution refers process running code
Exact method matter compiled done computer
refers binding argument function
Application partial complete
From functional programming world partial application produce another function le parameter complete application produce thunk
Thunks function parameter help lazy evaluation
refers process required schedule function fully bound argument execution
Such system include pushing argument onto stack transferring PC new address placing queue later execution various RPC system
Exact mechanism matter
The notion scheduling future execution matter
Invoking requires function execute
Calling Is least defined lot
Generally refers combined process fully applying function invoking usually added semantic code wait return value
Please also note term subjective point view current code written
Invoking function via RPC call invoking client side
From server side request different invocation point function even meaning function server side
Method Invokation term usually refered indirectly calling method function problem difficulty calling directly
For example context Parallel programming Consider two thread inside one application space running parallely
Calling public method object residing aother thread throw Cross Thread Invokation Exception race may occure
The solution invoking object execute method yeild rest job object manage parallel request
Another example delegate pointing method somewhere
When ask delegate call unknown method Invoke method run
Maybe simply considers term call invoke synonymous want mention word term encounter
Would possible use case

source stackoverflow Not sure I completely agree thing
To least term implies expectation return code get executed
In sense subset
Functions therefore would called
An example code function would invoked without expectation return might OS kernel launched bootloader
I suppose function C implies return rather special case fact return parent process OS like Linux
In assembler language CALL instruction push program counter register value return address onto stack subsequent RET instruction cause execution return instruction following CALL instruction
In contrast JMP jump instruction BR branch instruction simply invoke code specified address
In way code target address invoked code know get back branch occurred
Perhaps putting fine distinction matter however could also argued one fundamental element considered component programming programming
Branching looping key flow control element structured programming
If OP truly want limit scope function language I would concur term interchangeable
Still question
Ask

To activate
One usually speaks
In sense term synonymous

What difference invocation execution method
Are two thing
I think standard term
However I understand following way Well invoking method mean calling name parameter executing method mean executing running fetching line one one run
I aware standard definition understanding Invocation result execution
There subtle difference See also
When consider method remote difference invocation request start execution something execution something happening somewhere request successful becomes apparent
Consider also case reflection
This method Here also clearly invocation execution two different thing
If need convincing consider case invocation v execution reflection context As far knowledge concern Invocation execution
If invocation successful process execution start For example Parameters variable declared method signature created method execution
After invocation actual method executed local variable variable declared method body created method execution
parameter invocating local variable executing
Thus The successful invocation lead proceed execution

An call invoke give may take form These form described mutually exclusive
See also
As supplication prayer implies call upon god person etc
When person call upon God god goddess ask something protection favour spiritual presence ceremony etc
simply done form invoker word action
An example text invocation
All religion general use invoking prayer see example aka Hymns many text still preserved written character clay tablet addressed deity
An invocation also secular alternative prayer
On August Dan Nerren member Humanist Association Tulsa delivered secular invocation open meeting City Council
Nerren invited perform invocation compromise following dispute City Council prayer opening meeting
The invocation written Andrew Lovley member Southern Maine Association Secular Humanists previously used invocation invoke inauguration ceremony new city official
In usage comparable alternative conscientiously object taking kind reason belief
The word possession used neutral form mean state potentially psychological individual normal personality replaced another
This also sometimes known
This done mean communicating getting closer deity spirit need viewed synonymously
In religious tradition including invocation mean draw spirit Spirit force one body differentiated involves asking spirit force become present given location
Again state To invoke call evoke call forth
This essential difference two branch
In invocation macrocosm flood
In evocation magician become macrocosm creates microcosm
Possessive invocation may attempted singly often case Wicca pair one person invocation reciting liturgy prayer acting anchor person invoked allowing become vessel spirit deity
The person successfully invoked may moved speak act way acting deity spirit may lose
A communication might also given via imagery
They may also led recite text manner deity case invocation akin ritual drama
The Wiccan example recitation
See also
The ecstatic possessory form invocation may compared possession tradition devotee described ridden mounted deity spirit
In journalist described event witnessed Vodoun possession A woman splashed sand eye man cut belly shard glass bleed another swallowed fire
Nearby believer perhaps yam farmer fisherman heated knife crackling flame
Then another man brought one knife tongue
We cringed sight dumbfounded several repetition tongue even reddened
Possessive invocation also described certain Norse rite invoked ride worker Norse shamanism much like god ride horse
Indeed form possessive invocation appear throughout world mystical ecstatic tradition wherever devotee seek touch upon essence deity spirit
Some performed invocation purpose controlling extracting favor certain spirit deity
These invocation usually involve commandment threat entity invoked
The following curious example invocation found engraved statue Assyrian
Although seems constitute identification demon actually considered protective power command entity harm people possession
I Pazuzu son king evil spirit one descends impetuously mountain bring storm
That one I
Another example found book Conjuration goddess evoked piece bread threatened grant wish I bake bread salt Nor I cook honey wine I bake body blood soul The soul great Diana shall Know neither rest peace ever In cruel suffering till grant What I request I desire I beg heart
And grace granted O Diana
In honour thee I hold feast Feast drain goblet deep We dance wildly leap And thou grace I require Then dance wildest lamp Shall extinguished freely love
Invocation refer taking quality invoked allure ferocity
In instance literally called within oneself oneself external force depending personal belief system invoker
The main difference type invocation possessive category described former may appear controlled mixed together
In practice invocation may blend many category
See example Hymn Astarte first attributed contemporary actually written Mother inexhaustible incorruptible creature born first engendered thyself thyself conceived issue thyself alone seeking joy within thyself
Oh
Perpetually fertilized virgin nurse chaste lascivious pure revelling ineffable nocturnal sweet breather fire foam sea
Thou accordest grace secret thou unitest thou lovest thou seizest furious desire multiplied race savage beast couplest sex wood
Oh irresistible Astarte
hear take posse oh Moon
thirteen time year draw womb sweet libation blood

You might look title ask What IS invocation pronounced n The invocation simplest form prayer request spiritual presence God ceremony event
Whether appropriate invocation corporate association organizational event path I choose debate
However I emcee speak event I commonly see one mistake made consistently
Is mistake offering invocation event
No
Is mistake making nondenominational
Nope
Is mistake content
Not either
This mistake far simpler easier fix challenge posed
As engagement expert professional master ceremony concern invocation
Will message invocation received appropriate respectful effective manner
THAT big mistake come
But making mistake related speaker content bulk planning
Rather The emcee introduces invocation speaker give
As music fade speaker take stage
People audience stop conversing quiet
The speaker begin tone
At time server bustle around activity main serving floor EVEN MORE SO behind scene thinking seen heard
In reality every serving spoon fork knife throw tub loud carry throughout hall
So every dish gearing serve
Conversations table number inappropriate humor spew forth
The drapery act visual wall hold back dialogue team ready spring action
Now preparing serve guest great creating annoyance distracts offends
What get lost shuffle
And affect everything
Take step every time How keep attendee engaged physically emotionally
By allowing massive distraction occur
Use checklist guide share charge managing meal
While detail simple consider overlooking lead annoyance offense distraction
Don let happen watch
THAT big mistake

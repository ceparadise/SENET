In used control access common resource multiple system operating system
A trivial semaphore plain variable changed example incremented decremented toggled depending condition
The variable used condition control access system resource
A useful way think semaphore used system record many unit particular resource available coupled operation adjust record
avoid unit required become free necessary wait unit resource becomes available
Semaphores useful tool prevention race condition however use mean guarantee program free problem
Semaphores allow arbitrary resource count called semaphore restricted value called used implement
The semaphore concept invented found widespread use variety
It also used control mechanism controller example computer
Suppose library identical study room used one student time
Students must request room front desk wish use study room
If room free student wait desk someone relinquishes room
When student finished using room student must return desk indicate one room become free
In simplest implementation clerk front desk know number free room available know correctly student actually use room signed return done
When student request room clerk decrease number
When student release room clerk increase number
The room used long desired possible book room ahead time
In scenario front desk represents counting semaphore room resource student represent
The value semaphore scenario initially room empty
When student request room granted access value semaphore changed
After next student come drop
If someone request room resulting value semaphore would negative forced wait room freed count increased
If one room released several student waiting method used select one occupy room like FIFO flipping coin
And course student need inform clerk releasing room really leaving otherwise awkward situation student process leaving room packing textbook etc
another student enters room leave
When used control access resource semaphore track resource free keep track resource free
Some mechanism possibly involving semaphore may required select particular free resource
The paradigm especially powerful semaphore count may serve useful trigger number different action
The librarian may turn light study hall student remaining may place sign say room busy room occupied
The success protocol requires application follow correctly
Fairness safety likely compromised practically mean program may behave slowly act erratically even single process act incorrectly
This includes Even process follow rule may still occur different resource managed different semaphore process need use one resource time illustrated
Counting semaphore equipped two operation historically denoted P V see alternative name
Operation V semaphore operation P
The value semaphore number unit resource currently available
The P operation resource protected semaphore becomes available time resource immediately claimed
The V operation inverse make resource available process finished using
One important property semaphore value changed except using V P operation
A simple way understand P V operation Many operating system provide efficient semaphore primitive unblock waiting process semaphore incremented
This mean process waste time checking semaphore value unnecessarily
The counting semaphore concept extended ability claim return one unit semaphore technique implemented
The modified V P operation follows using square bracket indicate operation appear indivisible perspective process However remainder section refers semaphore unary V P operation unless otherwise specified
To avoid semaphore associated process usually semantics
If process performs P operation semaphore value zero process added semaphore queue execution suspended
When another process increment semaphore performing V operation process queue one removed queue resume execution
When process different priority queue may ordered priority highest priority process taken queue first
If implementation ensure atomicity increment decrement comparison operation risk increment decrement forgotten semaphore value becoming negative
Atomicity may achieved using machine instruction able semaphore single operation
In absence hardware instruction atomic operation may synthesized use
On system atomic operation ensured temporarily suspending disabling hardware
This approach work multiprocessor system possible two program sharing semaphore run different processor time
To solve problem multiprocessor system locking variable used control access semaphore
The locking variable manipulated using command
Consider variable boolean variable
accessed marked true
Thus semaphore
One imagine stoplight signal train station
In case signal green one enter train station
If yellow red color train station accessed
Consider system support ten user
Whenever user log P called decrementing semaphore
Whenever user log V called incrementing representing login slot become available
When user wishing log must wait login request enqueued onto FIFO queue used ensure request enqueued order
Whenever becomes greater login slot available login request dequeued user owning request allowed log
In one process producer generates data item another process consumer receives us
They communicate using queue maximum size subject following condition The semaphore solution problem track state queue two semaphore number empty place queue number element queue
To maintain integrity may lower never higher actual number empty place queue may lower never higher actual number item queue
Empty place item represent two kind resource empty box full box semaphore maintain control resource
The binary semaphore ensures integrity state queue compromised example two producer attempting add item empty queue simultaneously thereby corrupting internal state
Alternatively could used place binary semaphore
The initially initially initially
The producer following repeatedly The consumer following repeatedly Below substantive example Note may much lower actual number empty place queue example case many producer decremented waiting turn filling empty place
Note always hold equality producer consumer executing critical section
The canonical name V P come initial word
V generally explained increase
Several explanation offered P including test try pas grab
Dijkstra earliest paper subject give passing meaning release meaning It also mention terminology taken used railroad signal
Dijkstra subsequently wrote intended stand short literally try reduce parallel term used case try decrease
In English textbook operation called respectively
In software engineering practice often called standard library us
Some text call match original Dutch initial
A essentially thing binary semaphore sometimes us basic implementation
The difference used
While binary semaphore may used mutex mutex specific thread locked mutex supposed unlock
This constraint make possible implement additional feature mutexes

But Ghz referring
This referring
The clock computer clock wall used tell time
A computer clock like metronome keep beat musician play music
A clock change value every period
We use letter designate period
This signal repeat
Perhaps remember course calculus sine wave
This wave repeat per period
The difference sine wave clock sine wave curved
It gradually increase decrease
A clock signal squarish shape
Related period clock
Frequency defined unit
When hear clock rate usually given frequency
Thus Ghz mean cycle per second
A signal single period
The period clock second half nanosecond really really short period time
To give idea short time
Imagine everyone world sang exactly one note exactly one person sings time
Suppose note last one nanosecond
It would take second complete assuming billion people world
As see clock signal positive slope negative slope
This slope exaggerated see better
Normally would quite angled
There key feature clock Each positive clock edge appears per clock period
Each negative clock edge appears per clock period
Must clock always
The answer
We could clock stay three quarter period one quarter period fraction
If using positive edge matter long signal stay since use edge
However want use positive negative edge going consider want edge occur
Begin move finger right trace signal
Your finger move back
If happen trace positive edge second steadily moving right going faster slower period second frequency Hz
Tracing signal hand give better feel continuous signal behaves
Usually computer science major difficult time unless really like calculus engineering deal quantity discrete rather continuous
At point time someone ask current value signal
If use pipe analogy think signal alternating pumping red soda green soda
To give analogy imagine music conductor tapping beat baton stick regular interval
Suppose playing piano told play new note time tap baton
Thus fast conductor tap baton control often play note
Similarly rate positive clock edge appears control fast sequential logic device change output
It turn using clock design CPU easily use clock
This primary reason use clock

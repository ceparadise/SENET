Afterwards discus technique linear programming us solving problem integer programming ing
Facility Location Recall problem definition Given A set location opening facility I facility I associated cost opening fi
We also given set city J city j J associated cost going facility c j
The routing cost c form metric
Figure An example routing city facilites
Goal Open subset facility S route every j J facility S total cost opening facility plus total cost routing city facility minimized
The total cost solution C S facility opening cost Cf S plus routing cost CR S C S Cf S CR S
Review Last time discussed local search algorithm solving problem approximately
The local search algorithm started initially assigning location S arbitrary subset total set location I started S empty set
At every step algorithm perform one following operation adding facility removing facility swapping one facility another
The algorithm performs one operation lead reduction total cost C S continues adding subtracting swapping reach local optimum
Last lecture began prove cost local optimum given kind local search algorithm within small factor cost global optimum
Theorem For local optimum S global optimum C S C
We made partial progress towards proving last time bounding routing cost set We picked local optimum S argued routing cost S total cost global optimum
Our proof use local step analyize increase cost local step taken
Since S local optimum know every step cost going increase
Rearranging expression change cost local step taken produced following lemma
Lemma CR S C The local step used added facility optimal solution present current solution S routed city facility S new facility
To conclude proof remains shown facility opening cost S also small
Our second lemma stated facility opening cost S twice routing cost S plus twice total cost
Lemma Cf S CR S C This together first lemma tell u facility opening cost S four time total cost
Together Lemmas bound total cost S five time total cost
During previous lecture able prove Lemma begun process proving Lemma
Notation Recall introduced new notation end last class For facility used denote neighborhood facility
That refered j J assigned
For j j j denotes facility optimal solution j assigned
Likewise facility S used NS denote neighborhood facility NS refers j J assigned For j NS σ j σ j denotes facility solution j assigned
Furthermore S arg min
facility closest
The cost city routed S Ri c j σ j
The routing cost global solution city routed S c j σ j
Completion Facility Location Using notation able prove following claim Claim For facility S fi
Figure An example selection primary facility
Claim useful compare Lemma lemma trying prove sum S know definition iRi CR S iR CR S
The new inequality obtain adding S contains facility opening cost S routing cost S routing cost term
This last term problematic term facility count others thus equal Cf
To solve problem going use Claim facility In particular every facility going identify one facility S called primary facility
This facility S facility closest let P arg min S
By definition primary facility sum Claim primary facility one facility cost
Thus use Claim account mary facility opening cost
For remaining facility called secondary facility using slightly different algorithm bound facility opening cost secondary facility well
Claim For secondary facility S fi Ri
Once prove Claim proof Lemma follows
Proof Lemma Let P denote primary facility
Then S P set secondary facility
Cf S fi fi fi Cf CR S CR CR S C Proof Claim In order get kind bound facility opening cost S consider facility S perform local step involves facility look increase cost local step
Our local step removal facility S routing associated city primary facility assigned P
Removing decrease cost fi also incur corresponding increase routing cost every city j NS routing cost increase c j c j
So increase cost c j c j We know cost know S local optimum
For city j previously routed routed interested difference distance j distance j
Figure The relative distance city facility
Using Triangle Inequality determine c j c j c Again using Triangle Inequality determine c c c This bound quite convenient enough u yet value meaningful u original cost must bound quantitiy
Since primary facility know closer
c c
Therefore c c c This still quite convenient u want everything represented term routing cost j
Consider facility j j got routed optimal solution
We know closest optimal facility therefore facility closest since j c c j
Thus c c j Using Triangle Inequality last time c j c j c j j But cost routing j plus cost routing j j
So write total increase cost c j c j σ j Therefore Ri Which implies fi Ri
We proved Claim turn prof Lemma Lemma prof Theorem
The idea proof start locally optimal solution globally optimal solution far better suggests local improvement step applied improve locally optimal solution
Given local improvement step exist know globally optimal solution far better locally optimal solution
How executed one problem another depends specific problem grasp basic intuition going
This best analysis particular algorithm
This algorithm known
In several place use tightest possible bound possible tighten bound get
It also possible use kind dynamic adding removing swapping different facility time
This also lead improved approximation factor
We might also used different local step obtain better approximation factor
In analysis today used three local improvement step argue locally optimal solution close global one
If ended using one could gotten without using algorithm
Facility location problem come many different flavor
One particular flavor picking actly k different location minimizing sum routing cost
This similar local search algorithm start subset k location perform series swap get locally optimal solution
This algorithm general work number situation much better facility location using technique
Linear Programming Introduction Linear Programming one widely used general technique designing algorithm problem
Definition A linear program collection linear constraint ables linear objective function
Example Suppose two variable x
Maximize Subject x To get idea look like plot set pair x satisfy constraint
See Figure plot feasible region
The feasible region region point satisfy constraint shaded region
Any point inside polytope satisfies constraint
Our goal find pair maximizes

This algorithm find optimal solution major flaw could exponential number extreme point
If n variable polytope dimensional space
For example say polytope hypercube variable constraint xi
There extreme point hypercube efficiently enumerate possible extreme point polytope check function value
What typically done find solution Simplex Method
The Simplex Method start extreme point polytope follows edge polytope one extreme point another hill climbing sort stop reach local optimum
The average case complexity algorithm worst case exponential
There algorithm follow point polytope find optimal solution
The benefit Linear Programming write constraint exists algorithm going solve problem
Linear Programming interesting u solvable polynomial time closely related problem Integer Programming
So take problem reduce instance Integer Programming try solve new problem using technique solve Linear Programming problem
Integer Programming Definition An Integer Program Linear Program variable must integer
Figure The feasible region Integer Programming problem
In Integer Program trying optimize linear function set linear constraint additional constraint variable must integer
If solve Example subject constraint x integer would get optimal solution
This generally case
In general plot feasible set Integer Program get set point defined constraint goal optimize set integer point inside feasible region
A Linear Program optimize larger set contains integer point point inside feasible region
In eral optimum Integer Program different optimum corresponding Linear Program
With Integer Program list constraint form polytope space additional constraint optimizing integer point inside polytope
Note The integer point feasible region necessarily lie boundary extreme point particular necessarily integer point
A Linear Programming algorithm going find extreme point solution problem
This necessarily optimal solution Integer Program hopefully close enough

See Figure example minimization problem
The gap optimal solution Integer Program Linear Program known integrality gap
If gap large expect large approximation factor
If gap small approximation factor likely small
The integrality gap characterizes relax integrality improvement optimal solution
If using particular algorithm solving hard problem prove approximation factor better integrality gap
The approximation factor difference optimal solution Linear Program integral solution determined optimal fractional solution
When transformation problem Integer Program goal come Integer Program low integrality gap right way rounding step fractional solution integral solution
Note Finding fractional optimal solution Linear Program something known done take given
The good thing Linear Programs give u lower bound problem
If take problem reduce Integer Program relax Integer Program Linear Program solve Linear Program optimal solution Linear Program lower bound optimal solution Integer Program thus problem
This general way come lower bound
Coming good lower bound important step coming good approximation algorithm problem
So important technique
Most work involved technique coming good reduction Integer Programming good rounding technique approximate optimal fractional solution
Figure The possible constraint ILP problem
Note There multiple way enclose given set integer solution using linear constraint
See Figure
The smallest encloses feasible integer solution without many straints without enclosing integer point best
It art come right set linear constraint give low integrality gap small number constraint

The known derived name research organization operates largest laboratory world
Established organization based northwest suburb border
country granted full membership
CERN official
The term CERN also used refer laboratory scientific technical administrative staff member hosted user
In year CERN generated data
CERN main function provide infrastructure needed physic research result numerous experiment constructed CERN international collaboration
The main site host large computing facility primarily used experiment well
Researchers need remote access facility lab historically major hub
CERN also birthplace
The convention establishing CERN ratified September country Western Europe
The acronym CERN originally represented French word European Council Nuclear Research provisional council building laboratory established European government
The acronym retained new laboratory provisional council dissolved even though name changed current European Organization Nuclear Research
According former director CERN name changed abbreviation could become awkward OERN said could still CERN even name
CERN first president Sir
general secretary CERN early stage operation still provisional first
The laboratory originally devoted study soon applied concerned mainly study interaction
Therefore laboratory operated CERN commonly referred better describes research performed
Several important achievement particle physic made experiment CERN
They include In September CERN attracted medium attention reported detection possibly
Further test showed result flawed due incorrectly connected synchronization cable
The awarded development resulted discovery W Z boson
The Nobel Prize Physics awarded CERN staff researcher invention development particle detector particular
The Nobel Prize physic awarded theoretical description Higgs mechanism year Higgs boson found CERN experiment
The began CERN project named initiated
Cailliau jointly honoured contribution development World Wide Web
Based concept project intended facilitate sharing information researcher
The first website activated
On April CERN announced World Wide Web would free anyone
A copy created still published website historical document
Prior Web development CERN pioneered introduction Internet technology beginning early
More recently CERN become facility development hosting project including EGEE
It also host CIXP one two main Switzerland
CERN operates network six accelerator decelerator
Each machine chain increase energy particle beam delivering experiment next powerful accelerator
Currently active machine Many activity CERN currently involve operating LHC experiment
The LHC represents worldwide scientific cooperation project
The LHC tunnel located metre underground region nearby
The majority length French side border
It us km circumference circular tunnel previously occupied LEP shut November
CERN existing accelerator complex used proton lead ion injected LHC
Seven experiment located along collider study particle collision different aspect different technology
Construction experiment required extraordinary engineering effort
For example special rented Belgium lower piece CMS detector underground cavern since piece weighed nearly ton
The first approximately magnet necessary construction lowered special shaft March
The LHC begun generate vast quantity data CERN stream laboratory around world distributed processing making use specialized infrastructure
During April trial successfully streamed seven different site across world
The initial particle beam injected LHC August
The first beam circulated entire LHC September system failed day later faulty magnet connection stopped repair September
The LHC resumed operation November successfully circulating two beam energy tera TeV
The challenge engineer try line two beam smashed
This like firing two needle across Atlantic getting hit according LHC main engineer Steve Myers director accelerator technology Swiss laboratory
On March LHC successfully collided two proton beam TeV energy per proton resulting TeV collision energy
However start needed expected discovery
When TeV experimental period ended LHC revved TeV TeV per proton starting March soon began particle collision energy
In July CERN scientist announced discovery new particle later confirmed
In March CERN announced measurement performed newly found particle allowed conclude Higgs boson
In early LHC deactivated maintenance period strengthen electrical connection magnet inside accelerator upgrade
On April two year maintenance consolidation LHC restarted second run
Proton beam successfully circulated ring direction
The first ramp energy TeV performed April
Operation continued design collision rate could exceeded first time
CERN collaboration group worldwide investigating two main concept future accelerator A linear collider new acceleration concept increase energy larger version LHC project currently named
The smaller accelerator main site also known West Area originally built Switzerland alongside French border extended span border since
The French side Swiss jurisdiction obvious border within site apart line marker stone
There six entrance Meyrin site The SPS tunnel almost entirely outside main site mostly buried French farmland invisible surface
However surface site various point around either location building associated experiment facility needed operate collider cryogenic plant access shaft
The experiment located underground level tunnel site
Three experimental site France ATLAS Switzerland although ancillary cryogenic access site Switzerland
The largest experimental site site also known North Area target station experiment SPS accelerator
Other site one used LEP experiment latter used LHC experiment
Outside LEP LHC experiment officially named numbered site located
For example experiment looking production particle located North Area site used BEBC Meyrin West Area site examine neutrino interaction

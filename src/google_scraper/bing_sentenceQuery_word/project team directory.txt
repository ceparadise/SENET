To elaborate let put couple small example unzipping list cool CSE project
Few month back friend quite interested organizing programming contest junior
Earlier computer Science Association used post question blog participant submit solution sending email
Those solution checked manually
We like idea manual checking
We put thinking cap developed online judge
College internet speed NIT W quite poor
It quite hard communicate college especially evening due heavy internet traffic therefore I came Mini Multicast Java LAN Chat Application
It quite fast used run direct Connection No proxy
alumnus used visit college official certificate transcript document
thought process become easy booking movie ticket
Alumni get required document without travelling mile
We wrote code came following project
Good Summer Projects The answer depends upon strong specialized field plus interest
Although I think would fair enough share idea project indulges part use creativity well judgment find project idea following suggested guideline may help
Most project developed Java contains API almost every task easy use platform independent easily develop GUI project
That best interesting java project
Almost everyone u played Mario counter Strike etc
How making game
Making Java game indeed easy Java default Graphics framework
DEMO Can easily implemented Java Java Sample Audio API
Again easy implement
A basic knowledge Concurrent Server
Easy implement
Thanks Java Sample API
Designing UI text editor Java Swing cake walk
Use advanced data structure like suffix tree Patrica etc searching
Any File Can unzipped command line providing password argument
So write simple brute force program generate permutation possible password send command line creating running shell script
Run receive success return call simple Zip Password Cracker Project ready
Again pretty easy
Run simple program remote computer
Intelligently create huge file SYS directory impact eat space victim computer
Any Clean software ignore file solution Victims reformat hard drive
A project record key stroke PC store intelligent way
Again easily done Microsoft visual SetWindowsHookEx API
The premiere challenge smart enough outplay detecting
Small game project easily done rendering computer graphic
C application par regular Expression
Editing document another machine via Web
The useful tool The cgi module along cgitb module debugging available
extension enables write arcade game Python
Develop web browser take input speech render output Speech
Lot frame work tool available
Good project PHP AJAX Expert
Similar Can easily done PHP server side scripting Language
Develop CMS similar Joomla Drupal etc
Students developed CMS named Pragyan
They use project maintaining college well Website
Develop something like uild application much interactivity repository useful reusable like
This project easily done
Develop application storing file image audio video etc
secure way
Use advance almost cipher AES etc
encrypt data text data caching password protected like Apart port blocked
Our College LAN allow port Port
Therefore develop tool bypass blocked port UDP TCP protocol
Identify design Network Protocol
TOR famous application used student tunneling website
Most college internet provider even blocked TOR
So build similar application tunneling defend network surveillance traffic analysis
Various project idea included idea page
More renowned organization participate program every year propose various open source project idea page
LINK
Even selected GSOC program long list idea write code send push request contribute open source community
Data Mining Projects always interesting
Pick paper read algorithm implement favorite programming language
When type first letter facebook search box ever noticed friend name search frequently interact mostly fb appears top suggestion box
That highly efficient algorithm implemented facebook
Develop similar tool add additional well custom feature
Most existing classifier quite accurate
Either read paper modify existing algorithm propose new algorithm classification
Develop classifier prove classifier efficient existing one
Create application like C JAVA compiler android mobile phone tracker etc
Still question
Ask

In cataloging structure contains reference possibly directory
On many computer directory known provide relevancy traditional office
Files organized storing related file directory
In one file directory organized manner resembles directory contained inside another directory called
The term often used describe relationship subdirectory directory cataloged latter parent
The directory filesystem parent called directory
Historically even modern file system either support directory flat meaning subdirectory supported group directory containing file
In modern system directory contain mix file subdirectory
A reference location directory system called
In many program associated execute
Typically file name accessed program assumed reside within directory file name specified explicit directory name
Some operating system restrict access project directory thus isolating activity user
In early version Unix root directory home directory modern Unix usually us another directory purpose
In keeping Unix system treat directory type file
The name presenting analogy used office used hierarchical file system design ERMA Mark published well used almost modern desktop environment
Folders often depicted visually resemble physical file folder
There difference concept metaphor used represent
For example us concept help present content computer user fairly consistent way free user deal absolute directory path vary version Windows individual installation
Many operating system also concept smart folder reflect result file system search operation
These folder represent directory file hierarchy
Many allow creation folder organize email
These folder corresponding representation filesystem structure
If one referring term appropriate
The term refers way structured list document file folder stored computer
The distinction due way directory accessed Unix system usually referred directory viewed accessed graphical user may sometimes call folder
Operating system support hierarchical filesystems practically modern one implement form recent lookup
In world usually called DNLC although called
For local filesystems DNLC entry normally expire pressure recent entry
For necessary ensure entry invalidated client

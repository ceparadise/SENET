In computing term generally refers grouping
In principle user may belong none one many group although practice system place limit
The primary purpose user group simplify system
Suppose computer science department shared
The department made list student permitted access another list directory staff permitted access
Without group would give student permission every student directory staff member permission every staff directory
In practice would unworkable every time student staff member arrived administrator would allocate permission every directory
With group task much simpler create student group staff group placing user proper group
The entire group granted access appropriate directory
To add remove account one must need one place definition group rather every directory
This workflow provides clear separation concern change access policy alter directory permission change individual fall policy alter group definition
The primary us group Many system provide facility delegation group administration
In system group created one user may named group administrator
These group administrator capable adding removing user group without relying system administrator
Some system also provide joinable group group user may elect add
Joinable group intended used access control rather purpose
Many system especially system offer facility dynamic group
Traditionally group static one defines group individually selecting member
In dynamic group however administrator specify search criterion
All user match search criterion considered member dynamic group
For example one might build LDAP directory using source data student administration system
The student system could provide attribute might numeric code identifying program student enrolled
Suppose degreeCode
We could define group defined group need manually modify membership membership change automatically update flow system
One construct even complex definition could meaning user member group true enrolled BSC Computer Science degree program first year Computer Science
Some system
LDAP server distinguish group role
These concept mostly equivalent main difference group membership stored attribute group whereas role membership stored within user list role belong
The difference essentially one performance term type access faster process enumerating membership given collection faster group process enumerating collection user belongs faster role

Unix group used share file CS department user
Each user CS public machine associated list containing least one group file directory CS public machine associated exactly one group
This usually referred group membership group ownership respectively
That user group file owned group
Users automatically added one group account creation
Maintaining group membership handled CS Staff
If need added removed group please send email group name action would like taken
Managing group ownership file directory requires action user
All file directory owned user created
In addition owned user file directory owned group
It important group ownership correct ever want share file group
Group ownership imply group access must set file access permission group use file
Permissions set restrict type access group member directory file
You use different Unix group share file different set user
Users organized group every user least one group may group
Group membership give special access file directory belonging group
Every user primary login group may several secondary group
The user said group group name list group
You logged group
When logged assigned group called current group
You see group list group list user group command
For example list group cmmiller first group primary group
If type group get group
Unix system using NFS allow membership total group
If see group list may experience problem accessing file group
Every file directory username groupname associated
There command managing group ownership directory file
In example command even document use filename indicate name file case use command name directory
The long format listing command give permission bit owner group file directory
Use l filename command get listing single file directory
The command l l list file directory current directory
The one beginning directory
When file directory first created take group current group shell
This default group login shell start another shell group using command project
If going create file secondary group easier create file shell started newgrp command
If want change group associated file directory already exists use command project filename
You must owner file must member new group order make change
In many case group ownership matter want share file group important get ownership correct
Otherwise may inviting user put large file directory
Just setting file owned group give group access file
Granting limiting access done setting appropriate permission bit
You see permission bit set letter dash long listing file directory using command
The option l command list information directory file long format
Without file directory would listed instead directory asked
For example get long listing directory name test The first string character mode next link count see l detail third field owner fourth field group owns file
mode Begins indicates directory
The owner cmmiller permission bit rwx full access
Any user group csstaff permission bit browsing access read search without permission add rename delete file directory
Every user cmmiller group csstaff permission bit access
count There three file directory
The count usually one listing file
username cmmiller The user login name cmmiller owner file
The owner permission mode according first three code
The owner always change permission mode chmod command
groupname csstaff The directory said owned group
Any user group csstaff except cmmiller permission granted according middle three code permission mode
The first group group list primary group
The first group listed primary group
That may group belong
The current group csstaff
Use exit command exit shell current group restored newgrp command
The command syntax enable member group read file name file want share
The file readable group associated file
Once check make sure directory file owned correct group set permission mode everything one command name directory contains file want share
The chmod command also used allow member group put file directory
The owner directory open directory shared writing command name directory want member group create file
The group setting mean new file group owned user putting group ownership set match group directory rather current group owner
This recommended way keep group ownership correct
The make sticky directory
This mean owner file owner directory delete rename file
This recommended several user putting file directory
name group would like share file named
Whereas chmod command determines type access group member may file directory chgrp command determines group may access file directory
list file directory current directory
You use command verify You use UNIX group share unlimited number file ongoing basis others CS UNIX account member UNIX group
One common mistake sharing file UNIX system forget set file permission set incorrectly
If permission set correctly user see following message similar one try access directory file Permission Denied good group name since user group
Another common problem set file permission existing file neglect set permission newly created file
By default others access file
You must give explicit permission file created

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In personal business computing user group set people similar interest goal concern
The member regular meeting share idea
Ideally member user group live geographic area get together person
However user group member distributed throughout world meet using Internet chat room message board mailing list
Members may also correspond telephone basis
User group often Web site member visit regular basis stay informed
A user group may devoted particular technology application corporation
For example user group might discus asset limitation various digital camera program
A user group devoted wireless Internet would share experience various provider technology
Some user group involved product particular corporation
When devoted narrow range product idea user group sometimes called special interest group

In recipe quantity much need unit describes use measure
For example tablespoon teaspoon quantity use different unit
It important note unit whether lab kitchen
There however way answer question
A quantity may also considered nonspecific number item particularly one would hard count
You could refer quantity water quantity air cite number molecule mass
Units sometimes refer individual set
For example studying chemistry might unit gas unit conversion unit balancing equation
A set room apartment building may called unit
Any removable component piece electronics might e called unit
If term unit used way quantity mean many unit
If need unit blood transfusion number quantity

Computer science study computer programming practice making computer thing
Take look offered university interested find whether course CS course programming course something else example Software Engineering even combination
Many course advertised computer science offer significant programming component may put theoretical part course practice may sake learn skill making program
A caveat Science become muddied field modern time least United States university degree programming
This mean people interested programming must sign Computer Science degree reaction Computer Science program emphasize programming
That said Computer Science mathematical science Computational Mathematics might better term
It involves study graph theory algorithmic complexity formal logic automaton general logical structure describe transformation response input algorithm
A Computer Scientist classic sense could reason rule govern computing system including modern computer without necessarily knowing detail implementation current architecture
A strong background Computer Science give ability develop recall efficient scalable algorithm anticipate logical reduction reason soundly tractable
Programming contrast person use transform something machine
That make obvious intimate connection Computer Science much confusion come
A programmer relative environment language able take virtually set algorithm transform form writing code
A strong background programming CS degree provide enables write better code code easily understood others successful expressing algorithm implementing
There large amount crosstalk course high level experience one correspond strongly developing experience noted CS major almost always competent programmer seasoned programmer picked many principle CS
Think Physics Engineering
A good way remembering difference requires computer see work programming pencil paper Computer Science

Computer Science point view supposed Hard Science like Physics
It involves study compiler compiler generator hardware architecture concept various form number system algorithm algorithmic efficiency performance theory behind arithmetic operation processor
When I CS university spent lot time mucking around assembler learning difference compiling linking interpreting etcetera
A lot done programming act writing code compiled run via interpreter intention generating result solve problem
That Programming act solving problem described knowledge Computer Science
It kind Pure Maths Applied Maths split
You need Computer Science degree programmer programmer CS background likely deeper understanding behaviour computer program
I would reword question What difference Computer Science Software Engineering
After involve programming
Computer Science theortical study computation possible
It look thing like Godels Theorem Halting problem
Software engineering write program designed maintanable
theory programming
Programming implementation
scientific practical approach computation application
A computer scientist specializes theory computation design computational system
Its subfields divided variety theoretical practical discipline
Some field computational complexity theory explores fundamental property computational problem highly abstract field computer graphic emphasize visual application
Still field focus challenge implementing computation
For example programming language theory considers various approach description computation whilst study computer programming investigates various aspect use programming language complex system
interaction considers challenge making computer computation useful usable universally accessible human
If programming carpentry computer science
More info carpentry interested thing like order build thing frame subfloor interior wall drywall etc
How build take le time construct modified later
In case architecture part like CS anyway concerned thing like capability material big beam need support span
Similarly CS theoretical capability computer programming practical application knowledge
Computer science programming physic mechanical engineering
Computer science theoretical take scientific mathematical approach information computation
Computer programming practical process designing writing testing debugging maintaining source code computer program
They different related field
Both benefited
A degree computer science lot broader scope cover theory behind computing
A hand focused developing coding programming skill student training different programming language
If confused browse detail program California College San Diego
That may provide clarity regarding scope degree

A body substance
A physical quantity expressed combination magnitude expressed usually magnitude unit
For example
The physical quantity represented equivalently many unit system
Symbols quantity chosen according international recommendation
For example recommended symbol physical quantity recommended symbol quantity
Subscripts used two reason simply attach name quantity associate another quantity represent specific vector matrix tensor component
The type subscript expressed style
italic style abbreviation word whereas italic symbol physical quantity rather abbreviation word
physical quantity usually chosen single letter printed italic type
Symbols physical quantity vector bold type underlined arrow
If speed particle straightforward notation velocity
Numerical quantity even denoted letter usually printed roman upright type though sometimes italic
Symbols elementary function circular trigonometric hyperbolic logarithmic etc
change quantity like Δ Δ operator like also recommended printed roman type
Examples Most physical quantity include dimensionless
Neither name physical quantity symbol used denote implies particular choice unit though usually preferred assumed today due ease use applicability
For example quantity mass might represented symbol could expressed unit kg lb Da
The notion physical quantity introduced
By convention physical quantity organized dimensional system built upon base quantity regarded dimension
Base quantity quantity distinct nature defined quantity
Base quantity quantity basis quantity expressed
The seven base quantity ISQ corresponding unit dimension listed following table
Other convention may different number
system unit
The last two angular unit subsidiary unit used SI treated dimensionless
The subsidiary unit used convenience differentiate quantity pure number different measurement
Derived quantity whose definition based physical quantity base quantity
Important applied base unit space time
course derived length included completeness occur frequently many derived quantity particular density
Important convenient derived quantity density associated many quantity
Sometimes different term used interchangeably context sometimes used uniqueley
To clarify effective template derived quantity let quantity within scope context necessarily base quantity present table commonly used symbol applicable definition usage SI unit SI dimension q dimension
For time derivative specific molar flux density quantity one symbol nomenclature depends subject though time derivative generally written using overdot notation
For generality use respectively
No symbol necessarily required gradient scalar field since need written
For spatial density current current density flux notation common one context another differing change subscript
For current density unit vector direction flow
tangent flowline
Notice dot product unit normal surface since amount current passing surface reduced current normal area
Only current passing perpendicular surface contributes current passing surface current pass tangential plane surface
The calculus notation used synonymously
If No common symbol density used
length area volume higher dimension q T section surface boundary q scalar q vector The meaning term physical generally well understood everyone understands meant
The term imply physically
example yet variant coordinate change special general relativity
The notion physical quantity basic intuitive realm science need explicitly even
It universally understood scientist often deal quantitative data opposed qualitative data
Explicit mention discussion part standard science program suited program
The notion seldom used physic part standard physic vernacular
The idea often misleading name implies quantity physically measured yet often incorrectly used mean physical invariant
Due rich complexity physic many different field posse different physical invariant
There known physical invariant sacred possible field physic
Energy space momentum torque position length name found experimentally variant particular scale system
Additionally notion possible measure physical quantity come question particular quantum field theory normalization technique
As infinity produced theory actual measurement made really physical universe measure infinity renormalization scheme expressly dependent measurement scheme coordinate system metric system

A backlink incoming external specific
For example publish webpage website link webpage backlinks
Links page within website included backlink total
Web developer benefit backlinks inlinks two different way direct traffic search result placement
As link specific webpage published external site greater potential traffic generated website
This called direct traffic
By increasing direct traffic website gradually grow presence generate steady stream visitor website
While direct traffic helpful website generate majority traffic
Since search engine use backlinks important part search result placement external link important good search ranking
Therefore generating backlinks become common practice search engine optimization
The backlinks webpage better chance page rank highly search result relevant
If website many page backlinks overall number incoming link may help increase ranking page within website
While backlinks point website incoming link page within website beneficial well

Find best ROI web development internet marketing effort By really bad habit They like throw around strange word industry jargon talk customer without checking make sure client understand topic hand
Some intentionally paper fact use black hat technique ultimately hurt customer
But simply matter failing recognize part job educate client
One common phrase pop SEO world commonly referred
Conversely link website web page going another called
What inbound link website outbound link website owner vice versa
Below example backlink received article website In page left text Post Modern Marketing link point homepage website
That link outgoing link Engadget website incoming link backlink
Backlinks important number reason
The quality quantity page backlinking website criterion used search engine like Google determine ranking search engine result page SERP
The higher rank SERP better business people tend click first search result Google Bing search engine return
But search engine care backlinks
Well early day Internet search engine simple relied strictly keyword matching
It matter good content website popular website phrase page matched phrase someone searched page would likely show
That meant someone online journal documented length take car car accident repair shop people searching car accident repair shop would likely led page
Not terribly useful right
Well make thing worse website owner quickly realized could exploit weakness resorting keyword stuffing practice simply involved creating website massive list keywords making money ad revenue generated
This made search engine largely worthless weakened usefulness Internet whole
How could problem fixed
Back two student Stanford named Larry Page Sergey Brin started pondering could make better search engine get fooled keyword stuffing
They realized could measure website popularity cross index website could build much useful search engine
In published scientific paper introduced concept This topic explored another paper Brin Page contributed As noted paper page stuffed fulled useless keywords often wash result user interested While often complain run spammy page today issue far worse
In paper state November one top four commercial search engine find return search page response name top ten result That incredibly difficult imagine happening
Imagine searching word Google search engine pull first page result
And yet bad year ago
But PageRank changed everything
PageRank product two assumption They used assumption develop concept called PageRank website assigned value based upon many website linked
A website thousand website linking would huge score
A website backlinks would small score
In illustration PageRank Citation Ranking paper author demonstrate webpage pas value onto page
The two page left value respectively
The page value two link point page right
That page value divided two link conveys value
The page left three outgoing link carrying page value
One link go top page right end total value
The bottom right page backlinks total value
For purpose second paper Brin Page coauthor took PageRank spin incorporating experimental search engine compared performance AltaVista one popular search engine Web time
Their paper included screenshot comparing two engine result word The paper author noted AltaVista right returned rather random assortment search obscure optical physic department University Oregon campus networking group Carnegie Mellon Wesleyan computer science group page one campus Japanese university
Interestingly none first six result return homepage website On hand result PageRank engine aside single secondary listing link homepage major American university
The result much logical useful nature
If search university going want homepage popular university random subpages sprinkling college world
Larry Page Sergey Brin decided concept PageRank showed real promise built little search engine called You know rest story played
As know Google look number backlinks quality link determine importance website
Consequently SEO expert put lot effort getting backlinks customer
But good bad way accomplishing
Building quality backlinks take lot effort time
This type operation
This take ongoing dedication effort
Some example proper backlink building include Having diverse link profile help website attract visitor looked positively search engine
But remember link especially help increase site ranking actually harmful
With knowledge hand careful link backlinking
Don forget link search engine ranking
Another great benefit help people find website browsing website linking hence drive traffic website
The people clicking backlinks website higher traffic site better chance converting click lead sale website sell something

In serf element two principal operation The order element come stack give rise alternative name
Additionally operation may give access top without modifying stack
The name stack type structure come analogy set physical item stacked top make easy take item top stack getting item deeper stack may require taking multiple item first
Considered abstractly sequential collection push pop operation occur one end structure referred stack
This make possible implement stack pointer top element
A stack may implemented bounded capacity
If stack full contain enough space accept entity pushed stack considered state
The pop operation remove item top stack
Stacks entered computer science literature used term bury unbury mean calling returning subroutine
Subroutines already implemented proposed idea filed patent March Bauer received invention stack principle
The concept developed independently Australian first half
Stacks often described analogy stack plate cafeteria
Clean plate placed top stack pushing already
When plate removed stack one pop become new top
In many implementation stack operation push pop
An example top stack observes element without removing stack
Since done pop push data essential
An underflow condition occur stack top operation stack empty pop
Also implementation often function return whether stack empty
A stack easily implemented either
What identifies data structure stack either case implementation interface user allowed pop push item onto array linked list helper operation
The following demonstrate implementation using
An array used implement bounded stack follows
The first element usually bottom resulting first element pushed onto stack last element popped
The program must keep track size length stack using variable record number item pushed far therefore pointing place array next element inserted assuming index convention
Thus stack effectively implemented structure The operation add element increment index checking overflow Similarly decrement index checking underflow return item previously top one Using possible implement stack grow shrink much needed
The size stack simply size dynamic array efficient implementation stack since adding item removing item end dynamic array requires amortized O time
Another option implementing stack use
A stack pointer head list perhaps counter keep track size list Pushing popping item happens head list overflow possible implementation unless memory exhausted Some language make stack operation push pop available standard type
Some language notably family including designed around stack directly visible manipulated programmer
The following example manipulating stack Lisp interpreter prompt line starting interpreter response expression Several container type operation LIFO semantics additionally template class adapts existing container provide restricted operation
PHP class
Java library contains class specialization
Following example program language using class
A common use stack architecture level mean allocating accessing memory
A typical stack area computer memory fixed origin variable size
Initially size stack zero
A usually form hardware register point recently referenced location stack stack size zero stack pointer point origin stack
The two operation applicable stack There many variation basic principle stack operation
Every stack fixed location memory begin
As data item added stack stack pointer displaced indicate current extent stack expands away origin
Stack pointer may point origin stack limited range address either origin depending direction stack grows however stack pointer cross origin stack
In word origin stack address stack grows downwards towards address stack pointer must never incremented beyond etc
If pop operation stack cause stack pointer move past origin stack occurs
If push operation cause stack pointer increment decrement beyond maximum extent stack occurs
Some environment rely heavily stack may provide additional operation example Stacks often visualized growing bottom like stack
They may also visualized growing left right topmost becomes rightmost even growing top bottom
The important feature bottom stack fixed position
The illustration section example growth visualization top stack bottom since stack top item pushed popped
A move first element third position second first third second
Here two equivalent visualization process A stack usually represented computer block memory cell bottom fixed location stack pointer holding address current top cell stack
The top bottom terminology used irrespective whether stack actually grows towards lower memory address towards higher memory address
Pushing item stack adjusts stack pointer size item either decrementing incrementing depending direction stack grows memory pointing next cell copy new top item stack area
Depending exact implementation end push operation stack pointer may point next unused location stack may point topmost item stack
If stack point current topmost item stack pointer updated new item pushed onto stack point next available location stack updated new item pushed onto stack
Popping stack simply inverse pushing
The topmost item stack removed stack pointer updated opposite order used push operation
Many design including dedicated register use stack pointer dedicated call return push pop instruction implicitly update dedicated register thus increasing density
Some CISC processor like also typically stack pointer well
In contrast CPU design dedicated stack instruction therefore register may used stack pointer needed
The architecture example set register organised stack direct access individual register relative current top also possible
As machine general implicit argument allows small footprint good usage also prevents type optimization possible processor permitting two three operand
A stack structure also make implementation somewhat complex implement although still feasible exemplified modern implementation
example architecture using within another strategy avoid use slow main memory function argument return value
There also number small microprocessor implement stack directly hardware stack directly accessible
Examples line
Many microprocessor used implement programming language level
Stacks also used basis number mainframe mini computer
Such machine called famous
Calculators employing use stack structure hold value
Expressions represented prefix postfix infix notation conversion one form another may accomplished using stack
Many compiler use stack parsing syntax expression program block etc
translating low level code
Most programming language allowing parsed stack based machine
Another important application stack
Consider simple example finding correct path maze
There series point starting point destination
We start one point
To reach final destination several path
Suppose choose random path
After following certain path realise path chosen wrong
So need find way return beginning path
This done use stack
With help stack remember point reached
This done pushing point stack
In case end wrong path pop last point stack thus return last point continue quest find right path
This called backtracking
The prototypical example backtracking algorithm find vertex graph reached specified starting vertex
Other application backtracking involve searching space represent potential solution optimization problem
technique performing backtracking search without exhaustively searching potential solution space
A number meaning define basic operation adding two number printing character taking argument stack placing return value back stack
For example return stack operand stack also graphic state stack dictionary stack
Many also including
Almost way receive parameter return special stack hold information calling nesting order switch context called function restore caller function calling finish
The function follow runtime protocol caller callee save argument return value stack
Stacks important way supporting nested function call
This type stack used implicitly compiler support CALL RETURN statement equivalent manipulated directly programmer
Some programming language use stack store data local procedure
Space local data item allocated stack procedure entered deallocated procedure exit
The typically implemented way
Using stack data procedure call important security implication see programmer must aware order avoid introducing serious security bug program
Several use stack separate usual function call stack programming language principle organize information
These include Some computing environment use stack way may make vulnerable security breach attack
Programmers working environment must take special care avoid pitfall implementation
For example programming language use common stack store data local called procedure linking information allows procedure return caller
This mean program move data stack contains critical return address procedure call
If data moved wrong location stack oversized data item moved stack location large enough contain return information procedure call may corrupted causing program fail
Malicious party may attempt attack take advantage type implementation providing oversized data input program check length input
Such program may copy data entirety location stack may change return address procedure called
An attacker experiment find specific type data provided program return address current procedure reset point area within stack within data provided attacker turn contains instruction carry unauthorized operation
This type attack variation attack extremely frequent source security breach software mainly popular compiler use shared stack data procedure call verify length data item
Frequently programmer write code verify size data item either oversized undersized data item copied stack security breach may occur

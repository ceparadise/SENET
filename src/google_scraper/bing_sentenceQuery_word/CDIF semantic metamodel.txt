A metamodel surrogate model model model metamodeling process generating metamodels
Thus analysis construction development frame rule constraint model theory applicable useful predefined class problem
As name implies concept applies notion modeling
Metamodels many type diverse application
A thorough discussion presented following text
A metamodel surrogate model model model
simplified model actual model circuit system software like entity
Metamodel mathematical relation algorithm representing input output relation
A abstraction phenomenon metamodel yet another abstraction highlighting property model
A model conforms metamodel way computer program conforms grammar programming language written
Various type metamodels include polynomial equation neural network etc
Metamodeling construction collection concept thing term etc
within certain domain
Metamodeling typically involves studying output input relationship fitting right metamodels represent behavior
Common us metamodels Because meta character metamodeling theory metamodels relevance
The concept useful practical application
The latter main focus article
In use recommended
This contrasted classical development technique
A model always conforms unique metamodel
One currently active branch approach named proposed
This approach based utilization language write metamodels called
Typical metamodels proposed SPEM CWM
also published standard metamodel
All language presented could defined MOF metamodels
type metamodeling used analysis construction model applicable useful predefined class problem
see also
One important move systematic use
The OMG proposed standard called
based MOF
Among many MTLs example implementation standard AndroMDA
closely related
Both often used describe analyze relation concept For software engineering several model corresponding modeling activity distinguished A library similar metamodels called Zoo metamodels
There several type zoo
Some expressed ECore
Others written

SAP BW Exploring Semantic available

A various meaning Typically instance data semantic data model explicitly include kind relationship various data element located
To interpret meaning fact instance required meaning kind relation relation type known
Therefore semantic data model typically standardize relation type
This mean second kind semantic data model enable instance express fact include meaning
The second kind semantic data model usually meant create semantic database
The ability include meaning semantic database facilitates building enable application interpret meaning content
This implies semantic database integrated use standard relation type
This also implies general wider applicability relational database
The logical data structure DBMS whether totally satisfy conceptual definition data limited scope biased toward implementation strategy employed DBMS
Therefore need define data led development semantic data modeling technique
That technique define meaning data within context interrelationship data illustrated figure
The real world term resource idea event symbolically defined within physical data store
A semantic data model abstraction defines stored symbol relate real world
Thus model must true representation real world
According Klas Schrefl overall goal semantic data model capture meaning data integrating relational concept powerful abstraction concept known field
The idea provide high level modeling primitive integral part data model order facilitate representation real world situation
The need semantic data model first recognized Air Force result ICAM Program
The objective program increase manufacturing productivity systematic application computer technology
The ICAM Program identified need better analysis communication technique people involved improving manufacturing productivity
As result ICAM Program developed series technique known IDEF ICAM Definition Methods included following During application semantic modelling technique resulted semantic data model second kind
An example semantic data model standardised developed semantic modelling language
The definition Gellish language documented form semantic data model
Gellish semantic modelling language used create semantic model
Those semantic model stored Gellish Databases semantic database
A semantic data model used serve many purpose
Some key objective include This article incorporates website

Aggregated enterprise architecture wisdom Link I privy conversation value creating specific kind metamodel made I explain concept metamodel someone would I
First let start defining term The IEEE Online Software Engineering Vocabulary provides different definition term metamodel
In opinion definition applicable enterprise architecture one CDIF semantic
description set concept notation used define model Information technology CDIF framework Part Overview Note The CDIF semantic metamodel defines model used construct define model used system development
Peel away jargon get For example I created model fictitious company Contoso
They created strategy Enterprise Architect tied strategy business initiative business initiative business unit impacted initiative
A simple traceability model
If diagram model metamodel
That diagram In metamodel provide definition three term strategy initiative business unit
They meaningful context model single definition
In addition metamodel defines every relationship allowed element
We say initiative may involve business unit model show relationship business unit strategy UNLESS initiative aligned strategy involves business unit
A metamodel restricts draw
It prevents drawing thing make sense
And clearly defines term someone read model know WHY described thing strategy thing initiative example
A metamodel grammar definition word
It provides dictionary
The model story tell word

A modeling development methodology combination language expressing universal domain ontology approach developing system using language
A common way building comparing evaluating methodology metamodeling process modeling methodology
Most methodology metamodels pertain language part methodology leaving description system development process describing informally
A major reason method used metamodeling structuralor objectoriented hence le expressive modeling procedural aspect methodology
In paper apply Methodology OPM specify generic system development process
This metamodel made possible due OPM view object process equal footing rather viewing object class superior owner process
This way OPM enables specifying structural ontological construct behavioral system development aspect methodology single unified view

Critical Path Analysis available

Path analysis form multiple regression used evaluate causal model examining relationship dependent variable two independent variable
Using method one estimate magnitude significance causal connection variable
There two main requirement path analysis
All causal relationship variable must go one direction pair variable cause
The variable must clear since one variable said cause another unless precedes time
Path analysis theoretically useful unlike technique force u specify relationship among independent variable
This result model showing causal mechanism independent variable produce direct indirect effect dependent variable
Path analysis developed Sewall Wright geneticist
Over time method adopted physical science social science including sociology
Today one conduct path analysis statistical program including SPSS STATA among others
The method also known causal modeling analysis covariance structure latent variable model
Typically path analysis involves construction path diagram relationship variable causal direction specifically laid
When conducting path analysis one might first construct input path diagram illustrates
After statistical analysis completed researcher would construct output path diagram illustrates relationship actually exist according analysis conducted
Let consider example path analysis might useful
Say hypothesize age direct effect job satisfaction hypothesize positive effect older one satisfied job
A good researcher realize certainly independent variable influencing dependent variable situation job satisfaction like example autonomy income among others
Using path analysis one create diagram chart relationship age autonomy typically older one greater degree autonomy age income tends positive relationship two
Then diagram also show relationship two set variable dependent variable job satisfaction
After evaluate relationship one redraw diagram indicate magnitude significance relationship
While path analysis useful evaluating causal hypothesis method determine causality
It clarifies correlation indicates strength causal hypothesis prove direction causation
Students wishing learn path analysis conduct refer Bryman Cramer

I keep coming across use word I never understand use meaning conveyed
Phrases like add semantics read semantics semantic web semantically correctly way confuse I referring web
Is word another way say grammar syntax
Thanks
Semantics meaning various element program whatever
For example let look code Both variable integer
From compiler point view exactly
However judging name one width something count thing
Syntactically okay since assign integer
However semantically totally wrong since width number child probably relationship
In case say semantically incorrect even compiler permit
Syntax structure
Semantics meaning
Each different context give different shade meaning term
HTML example new tag meant provide meaning data wrapped tag
The tag conveys data contained within information around
See meaning markup
Take look
Contrast older familiar HTML tag like
Each one affect appearance HTML content rendered browser ca tell u
They contain information meaning
It mean meaning got left already accounted syntax grammar
For example defined grammar valid statement say nothing
Increment one semantics
semantics description supposed put page
Semantic web generally web link search meaning word
The semantically correct way something mean right thing
The word adjective simply mean related word level computer science
For instance Semantic data model data model semantic meaningful understood anyone regardless background expertise
le semantic Java Java us meaningful word class method field
semantics refer tag describe
Check wiki page Very good description
It Computer Science terminology ask What behind Computer Science lingo
I afraid get recursive loop like
In HTML world semantic used talk meaning tag rather considering output look
For example common italicize foreign word also common italicize emphasized word
You could simply wrap foreign emphasized word tag describes look describe look way
A better tag use emphasized word conveys semantics emphasis
The browser stylesheet render italic consumer page know word emphasized
For example could properly read emphasized word
From view almost like looking syntax grammatical way
I ca speak semantics broad term When people talk semantics web normally referring idea stripped away cs javascript etc left bare bone html would make sense read
It also take account using correct tag correct markup
This stem old layout table used tabular data using list present content
You would use something le important
That would make sense

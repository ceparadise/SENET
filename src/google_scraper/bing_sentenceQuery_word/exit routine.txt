I studying lisp language lisp routine general context know routine technical context talk starting learn routine
So real definition routine
already googled find anything The term derives common term language like BASIC one actually creates SUBroutines
BASIC actually difference SUBroutine FUNCTION nevertheless From Wikipedia entry In computer science subroutine As name subprogram suggests subroutine behaves much way computer program used one step larger program another subprogram
A subroutine often coded started called several time several place single execution program including subroutine branch back return next instruction call subroutine task done
Different different ecosystem thus different term describe general concept
I generally use term OOP environment day
Happy coding
For fun I Community
The list hopefully cover term correct widely accepted use given language mean
Informally used context language omitted unless defacto term used
Feel free add correct annotate appropriate
You ca find technical definition technical definition specific lisp
A outside vaudeville another name function
While many year since I programmed Lisp one ever used term formal way even used commonly
We talked

method solution problem depends solution smaller instance problem opposed
The approach applied many type problem one central idea computer science
The power recursion evidently lie possibility defining infinite set object finite statement
In manner infinite number computation described finite recursive program even program contains explicit repetition
Most computer programming language support recursion allowing call within program text
Some define looping construct rely solely recursion repeatedly call code
prof language computationally powerful Turing complete imperative language meaning solve kind problem imperative language even without iterative control structure
A common tactic divide problem type original solve combine result
This often referred combined store result solving avoid solving repeatedly incurring extra computation time referred
A recursive function definition one meaning input function produce result without recurring one meaning input program recurs call
For example function defined recursively equation
Neither equation constitutes complete definition first base case second recursive case
Because base case break chain recursion sometimes also called terminating case
The job recursive case seen breaking complex input simpler one
In properly designed recursive function recursive call input problem must simplified way eventually base case must reached
Functions intended terminate normal example exception
Neglecting write base case testing incorrectly cause
For function one computes obvious base case implied input data one may add number term added series example provide criterion establishes base case
Such example naturally treated successive term output partial sum converted recursion using indexing parameter say compute th term th partial sum
Many must process generate arbitrarily large quantity
Recursion one technique representing data whose exact size know programmer specify data definition
There two type definition inductive definition
An inductively defined recursive data definition one specifies construct instance data
For example defined inductively using syntax The code specifies list string either empty structure contains string list string
The definition permit construction list finite number string
Another example inductive positive Similarly recursive often used model structure programming language
Language designer often express grammar syntax grammar simple language arithmetic expression multiplication addition This say expression either number product two expression sum two expression
By recursively referring expression second third line grammar permit arbitrarily complex arithmetic expression one product sum operation single expression
A coinductive data definition one specifies operation may performed piece data typically coinductive definition used data structure infinite size
A coinductive definition infinite string given informally might look like This similar inductive definition list string difference definition specifies access content data via function content may whereas inductive definition specifies create structure may created
related coinduction used compute particular instance possibly infinite object
As programming technique used often context programming language preferable recursion desired size precision program output unknown
In case program requires definition infinitely large infinitely precise result mechanism taking finite portion result
The problem computing first n one solved corecursive program

Recursion contains single known recursion contains multiple known
Standard example single recursion include list traversal linear search computing factorial function standard example multiple recursion include search
Single recursion often much efficient multiple recursion generally replaced iterative computation running linear time requiring constant space
Multiple recursion contrast may require exponential time space fundamentally recursive able replaced iteration without explicit stack
Multiple recursion sometimes converted single recursion desired thence iteration
For example computing Fibonacci sequence naively multiple iteration value requires two previous value computed single recursion passing two successive value parameter
This naturally framed corecursion building initial value tracking step two successive value see
A sophisticated example using allows iterative tree traversal rather multiple recursion
Most basic example recursion example presented demonstrate function call
recursion occurs function called another function called either directly indirectly
For example call direct recursion call call indirect recursion Chains three function possible example function call function function call function function call function
Indirect recursion also called symmetric term though simply difference emphasis different notion
That call call turn call point view alone indirectly recursing point view alone indirectly recursing point view mutually recursing
Similarly set three function call called set mutually recursive function
Recursion usually done explicitly calling function name
However recursion also done via implicitly calling function based current context particularly useful known
Some author classify recursion either structural generative
The distinction related recursive procedure get data work process data Functions consume structured data typically decompose argument immediate structural component process component
If one immediate component belongs class data input function recursive
For reason refer function STRUCTURALLY RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
Thus defining characteristic structurally recursive function argument recursive call content field original input
Structural recursion includes nearly tree traversal including XML processing binary tree creation search etc
By considering algebraic structure natural number natural number either zero successor natural number function factorial may also regarded structural recursion
alternative Many recursive algorithm generate entirely new piece data given data recur
refers kind generative recursion
Examples generative recursion include
This distinction important function
A classic example recursive procedure function used calculate The function also written This evaluation recurrence relation demonstrates computation would performed evaluating pseudocode This factorial function also described without using recursion making use typical looping construct found imperative programming language The imperative code equivalent mathematical definition using accumulator variable The definition translates straightforwardly example iteration implemented recursively
The computes two integer written recursively
Function definition greatest common divisor express The recursive program equivalent iterative algorithm computation shown show step evaluation would performed language eliminates tail call
Below version algorithm using explicit iteration suitable language eliminate tail call
By maintaining state entirely variable using looping construct program avoids making recursive call growing call stack
The iterative algorithm requires temporary variable even given knowledge Euclidean algorithm difficult understand process simple inspection although two algorithm similar step
The Towers Hanoi mathematical puzzle whose solution illustrates recursion
There three peg hold stack disk different diameter
A larger disk may never stacked top smaller
Starting disk one peg must moved another peg one time
What smallest number step move stack
Example implementation Although recursive function explicit solution Tower Hanoi sequence reduced explicit formula
The algorithm method searching single element cutting array half recursive pas
The trick pick midpoint near center array compare data point data searched responding one three possible condition data found midpoint data midpoint greater data searched data midpoint le data searched
Recursion used algorithm pas new array created cutting old one half
The binary search procedure called recursively time new smaller array
Typically array size adjusted manipulating beginning ending index
The algorithm exhibit logarithmic order growth essentially divide problem domain half pas
Example implementation binary search C An important application recursion computer science defining dynamic data structure
Recursive data structure dynamically grow theoretically infinite size response runtime requirement contrast size static array must set compile time
Recursive algorithm particularly appropriate underlying problem data treated defined recursive term
The example section illustrate known structural recursion
This term refers fact recursive procedure acting data defined recursively
As long programmer derives template data definition function employ structural recursion
That recursion function body consume immediate piece given compound value
Below C definition linked list node structure
Notice especially node defined term
The next element pointer another effectively creating list type
Because data structure defined recursively procedure operate implemented naturally recursive procedure
The procedure defined walk list list empty list pointer value NULL
For node print data element integer
In C implementation list remains unchanged procedure
Below simple definition binary tree node
Like node linked list defined term recursively
There two pointer left pointing left right pointing right
Operations tree implemented using recursion
Note two pointer left right tree operation may require two recursive call At two recursive call made given call defined
The example illustrates binary tree
A special case binary tree data element node order
Since number file may vary practical way traverse thus enumerate content
Traversing filesystem similar therefore concept behind tree traversal applicable traversing filesystem
More specifically code would example filesystem
This code blend line least somewhat recursion
It essentially recursive implementation best way traverse
It also example direct indirect recursion
The method rtraverse purely direct example method traverse indirect call rtraverse
This example need base case scenario due fact always fixed number file directory given filesystem
In actual implementation rather pure recursive function single check base case otherwise recursive step number modification may made purpose clarity efficiency
These include On basis elegance wrapper function generally approved base case frowned upon particularly academia
Hybrid algorithm often used efficiency reduce overhead recursion small case recursion special case
A function directly called recurse instead calling separate auxiliary function actually recursion
Wrapper function used validate parameter recursive function skip perform initialization allocate memory initialize variable particularly auxiliary variable level recursion partial computation handle exception error
In language support auxiliary function nested inside wrapper function use shared scope
In absence nested function auxiliary function instead separate function possible private called directly information shared wrapper function using
base case also known consists checking base case making recursive call checking next call base case instead calling checking base case
particularly done efficiency reason avoid overhead function call immediately return
Note since base case already checked immediately recursive step need checked separately one need use wrapper function case overall recursion start base case
For example factorial function properly base case
immediately returning
may miss mitigated wrapper function
primarily concern many base case encountered Null pointer tree linear number function call hence significant saving algorithm illustrated search
tree corresponds considering leaf node child base case rather considering empty node base case
If single base case computing factorial provides saving
Conceptually considered either base case recursive step checking base case recursion considered different base case one step removed standard base case complex recursive step namely check valid recurse considering leaf node rather Null node base case tree
Because complicated flow compared clear separation base case recursive step standard recursion often considered poor style particularly academia
A basic example given DFS binary tree see section standard recursive discussion
The standard recursive algorithm DFS In instead In term standard step move base case check recursive step
Alternatively considered different form base case recursive step respectively
Note requires wrapper function handle case tree empty root node Null
In case height node Null pointer child leaf cut number function call half worst case
In C standard recursive algorithm may implemented The algorithm may implemented Note use Boolean AND operator recursive call made node valid
Note first term AND pointer node second term bool overall expression evaluates bool
This common idiom recursive
This addition evaluation Boolean OR operator check right child left child fails
In fact entire function replaced single Boolean expression return statement legibility suffers benefit efficiency
Recursive algorithm often inefficient small data due overhead repeated function call return
For reason efficient implementation recursive algorithm often start recursive algorithm switch different algorithm input becomes small
An important example often implemented switching data sufficiently small
Hybrid recursive algorithm often refined derived hybrid merge sort
Recursion iteration equally expressive recursion replaced iteration explicit stack iteration replaced tail recursion
Which approach preferable depends problem consideration language used
In iteration preferred particularly simple recursion avoids overhead function call call stack management recursion generally used multiple recursion
By contrast recursion preferred tail recursion optimization leading little overhead sometimes explicit iteration available
Compare template compute x defined x f n x x For imperative language overhead define function functional language overhead define accumulator variable x
For example factorial function may implemented iteratively C assigning loop index variable accumulator variable rather passing argument returning value recursion Most use today allow direct specification recursive function procedure
When function called program keep track various instance function often using although method may used
Every recursive function transformed iterative function replacing recursive call simulating call stack explicitly managed program
Conversely iterative function procedure evaluated computer see expressed term recursive function iterative control construct routinely rewritten recursive form
However practice rewriting depends feature language
notable mainstream language function call including may cause stack allocation would occur use looping construct language working iterative program rewritten recursive form may although tail call elimination may feature covered language specification different implementation language may differ tail call elimination capability
In language favor iterative looping construct usually significant time space cost associated recursive program due overhead required manage stack relative slowness function call function call particularly typically fast operation difference usually le noticeable
As concrete example difference performance recursive iterative implementation factorial example depends highly compiler used
In language looping construct preferred iterative version may much several order magnitude faster recursive one
In functional language overall time difference two implementation may negligible fact cost multiplying larger number first rather smaller number iterative version given happens may overwhelm time saved choosing iteration
In programming language maximum size much le space available recursive algorithm tend require stack space iterative algorithm
Consequently language sometimes place limit depth recursion avoid stack overflow one language
Note caveat regarding special case
Multiply recursive problem inherently recursive prior state need track
One example contrast list traversal linear search list singly recursive thus naturally iterative
Other example include function
All algorithm implemented iteratively help explicit programmer effort involved managing stack complexity resulting program arguably outweigh advantage iterative solution
function function recursive call hence build deferred operation
For example gcd function shown
In contrast factorial function also recursive call tail position build deferred multiplication operation must performed final recursive call completes
With treat call rather function call function gcd execute using constant space
Thus program essentially iterative equivalent using imperative language control structure like loop
The significance tail recursion making call tail call caller return position need saved recursive call return branch directly previously saved return position
Therefore language recognize property tail call tail recursion save space time
In simple case function calling instruction placed recursive call executed per recursion instruction placed recursive call
The latter executed repeatedly maximum recursion reached
Consider example The recursive algorithm expressed
They usually simplified single term
If function form Then thus represents number recursive call level recursion represents factor smaller input next level recursion
number piece divide problem represents work function independent recursion
partitioning recombining level recursion

This make program shorter easier write also read necessary
The main sequence logic program branch common routine necessary
When finished routine branch back next sequential instruction following instruction branched
A routine may also useful one program save programmer write code shared
Typically language routine requires variable input encoded specified interface called
The programmer use macro instruction instead include manage branching routine
Macro definition instruction also tend shared among programmer use multiple program especially software development project
In computer language many routine prepackaged routine specified programming interface

In sequence program instruction perform specific task packaged unit
This unit used program wherever particular performed
Subprograms may defined within program separately used multiple program
In different programming language subroutine may called
The generic term sometimes used
The name suggests subroutine behaves much way computer program used one step larger program another subprogram
A subroutine often coded started called several time several place one execution program including subroutine branch back next instruction subroutine task done
credited invention concept termed contrasted
Subroutines powerful tool many includes support writing using
Judicious use subroutine example approach often substantially reduce cost developing maintaining large program increasing quality reliability
Subroutines often collected important mechanism sharing trading software
The discipline based subroutine attached object object
In method called executable program basically sequence subroutine call
The content subroutine body piece program code executed subroutine called invoked
A subroutine may written expects obtain one data value calling program replace formal parameter
The calling program provides actual value parameter called
Different programming language may use different convention passing argument The subroutine may return computed value caller provide various result value output parameter
Indeed common use subroutine implement purpose subroutine purely compute one result whose value entirely determined argument passed subroutine
Examples might include computing number
A subroutine call may also modifying reading writing creating halting program machine even delaying program execution specified time
A subprogram side effect may return different result time called even called argument
An example available many language return different number time called
The widespread use subroutine side effect characteristic language
A subroutine coded may one place perform task
This method allows direct implementation function defined recursive
A subroutine whose purpose compute one answer question sometimes called predicate
In language often subroutine called predicate since primarily determine success failure
For example type function subroutine main
usually include specific construct Some many distinguish function function subprogram provide explicit return value calling program subroutine procedure
In language function call normally embedded function may called
Procedure call either behave syntactically procedure may called explicitly invoked statement

Other language distinguish function subroutine
In strictly language subprogram mean various internal state program change
Functions always return result repeatedly called argument
Such language typically support function since subroutine return value use unless cause side effect
In subroutine may also simply called function confused different concept
A language usually translate procedure call return machine instruction according subroutine compiled separately program call
The instruction sequence corresponding call return statement called procedure
The advantage breaking program subroutine include Invoking subroutine versus using code imposes call mechanism
A subroutine typically requires standard code entry exit function usually saving return address minimum
The idea subroutine worked computing machine already existed time
The arithmetic conditional jump instruction planned ahead time changed relatively little special instruction used procedure call changed greatly year
The earliest computer microprocessor single subroutine call instruction
Subroutines could implemented required programmer use call series
Some early computer microprocessor subroutine call us dedicated hardware stack store return hardware support level subroutine nesting support recursive subroutine
Machines mid use saved instruction counter first memory location called subroutine
This allows arbitrarily deep level subroutine nesting support recursive subroutine
The one first computer subroutine call instruction feature support arbitrarily deep subroutine nesting also support recursive subroutine
In early assembler subroutine support limited
Subroutines explicitly separated main program indeed source code subroutine could interspersed subprogram
Some assembler would offer predefined generate call return sequence
By assembler usually much sophisticated support inline separately assembled subroutine could linked together
Even cumbersome approach subroutine proved useful
For one thing allowed use code many different program
Moreover memory scarce resource early computer subroutine allowed significant saving size program
Many early computer loaded program instruction memory
Each subroutine could provided separate piece tape loaded spliced main program mainline subroutine tape could used many different program
A similar approach applied computer used main input
The name originally meant library literal sense kept indexed collection tape collective use
To remove need computer designer eventually provided instruction whose operand instead location variable containing return address
On computer instead modifying subroutine return jump calling program would store return address variable subroutine completed would execute indirect jump would direct execution location given predefined variable
Another advance instruction combined saving return address calling jump thereby minimizing significantly
In IBM example branch instruction BAL BALR designed procedure calling would save return address processor register specified instruction
To return subroutine execute indirect branch instruction BR register
If subroutine needed register purpose calling another subroutine would save register content private memory location register
In system JSB instruction would perform similar task except return address stored memory location target branch
Execution procedure would actually begin next memory location
In HP assembly language one would write example call subroutine called MYSUB main program
The subroutine would coded The JSB instruction placed address NEXT instruction namely BB location specified operand namely MYSUB branched NEXT location namely AA MYSUB
The subroutine could return main program executing indirect jump JMP MYSUB I branched location stored location MYSUB
Compilers Fortran language could easily make use instruction available
This approach supported multiple level call however since return address parameter return value subroutine assigned fixed memory location allow recursive call
Incidentally similar method used early discover recalculation dependency spreadsheet
Namely location reserved cell store address
Since allowed natural recalculation order allows tree walk without reserving space stack memory limited small computer
Most modern implementation use special case implement subroutine call return
Each procedure call creates new entry called top stack procedure return stack frame deleted stack space may used procedure call
Each stack frame contains corresponding call typically includes procedure parameter internal variable return address
The call sequence implemented sequence ordinary instruction approach still used RISC VLIW architecture many traditional machine designed since late included special instruction purpose
The call stack usually implemented contiguous area memory
It arbitrary design choice whether bottom stack lowest highest address within area stack may grow forward backwards memory however many architecture chose latter
Some design notably implementation used two separate stack one mainly control information like return address loop counter data
The former worked like call stack indirectly accessible programmer language construct latter directly accessible
When procedure call first introduced important motivation save precious memory
With scheme compiler reserve separate space memory private data parameter return address local variable procedure
At moment stack contains private data call currently namely called returned yet
Because way program usually assembled library still uncommon find program include thousand subroutine handful active given moment
For program call stack mechanism could save significant amount memory
Indeed call stack mechanism viewed earliest simplest method
However another advantage call stack method allows since nested call procedure get separate instance private data
One disadvantage call stack mechanism increased cost procedure call matching return
The extra cost includes incrementing decrementing stack pointer architecture checking accessing local variable parameter address instead absolute address
The cost may realized increased execution time increased processor complexity
This overhead obvious objectionable return without making procedure call
To reduce overhead many modern compiler try delay use call stack really needed
For example call procedure may store return address parameter called procedure certain processor register transfer control procedure body simple jump
If procedure return without making call call stack used
If need call another procedure use call stack save content register return address needed return
In programming language subprogram termed classified associated
These language use special keyword indicate function take parameter especially C return value
Note function including modifying variable whose address passed parameter
Examples The function return value called function This function return result number call part expression This function convert number initial letter corresponding day week namely
The result calling might assigned variable
This function return value modifies variable whose address passed parameter would called
In example call subroutine define actual subroutine keyword must used subroutine name following
After content followed must typed
In language subprogram termed associated class
Visual Basic us various term called define passed parameter
By default unspecified variable registered passed default
Also function sub declared given public private friend designation determines whether accessed outside module project declared
The function return value called function This function return result number call part expression This function convert number initial letter corresponding day week namely
The result calling might assigned variable
This function return value modifies variable whose address passed parameter would called
In called procedure may passed providing information argument string length array bound
This allows procedure general eliminates need programmer pas information
By default pass argument reference
A trivial subroutine change sign element array might look like This could called various array follows A subprogram may find useful make use certain amount space used execution subprogram hold intermediate result
Variables stored scratch space termed scratch space termed
An activation record typically tell pas control back subprogram finish
A subprogram may number nature call site
If recursion supported subprogram may even call causing execution suspend another execution subprogram occurs
useful mean simplify complex algorithm break complex problem
Recursive language generally provide new copy local variable call
If programmer desire value local variable stay call declared language global value common area used
Here example recursive subroutine find number Early language like initially support recursion variable statically allocated well location return address
Most computer late support hardware stack register
Modern language almost invariably use stack usually supported modern computer instruction set provide fresh activation record every execution subprogram
That way nested execution free modify local variable without concern effect suspended execution progress
As nested call accumulate structure formed consisting one activation record suspended subprogram
In fact stack structure virtually ubiquitous activation record commonly termed
Some language also support subroutine callable within outer parent subroutine
Inner subroutine access local variable outer subroutine called
This accomplished storing extra context information within activation record also termed
If subprogram executed properly even another execution subprogram already progress subprogram said
A recursive subprogram must reentrant
Reentrant subprogram also useful situation since multiple thread call subprogram without fear interfering
In slightly le restrictive similar requirement application program shared many thread
In environment generally one stack
An environment fully support may use data structure stack store activation record
In sometimes desirable number function name operating different type data different parameter profile
For example square root function might defined operate real complex value matrix
The algorithm used case different return result may different
By writing three separate function name programmer convenience remember different name type data
Further subtype defined real separate positive negative real two function written real one return real parameter positive another return complex value parameter negative
In series function name accept different parameter profile parameter different type function said
Here example subroutine overloading In code two function name different parameter
As another example subroutine might construct accept direction trace path point screen
There plethora parameter could passed constructor colour trace starting x trace speed
If programmer wanted constructor able accept color parameter could call another constructor accepts color turn call constructor parameter passing set parameter X Y would generally centered screen placed origin speed would set another value coder choosing
A subprogram together value variable captured environment created
Closures notable feature Lisp programming language introduced
Depending implementation closure serve mechanism
A wide number convention coding subroutine developed
Pertaining naming many developer adopted approach name subroutine certain task make inquiry used substitute variable
Some programmer suggest subroutine perform one task subroutine perform one task split subroutine
They argue subroutine key component role program must remain distinct
Proponents modularizing code advocate subroutine minimal dependency piece code
For example use generally deemed unwise advocate perspective add tight coupling subroutine global variable
If coupling necessary advice subroutine accept passed instead
However increasing number parameter passed subroutine affect code readability
Besides effect subroutine may need inform calling program condition may occurred execution
In language programming standard often done integer value placed subroutine standard location encodes normal exceptional condition
In return code expected subroutine return value often designed multiple could used direct index branch table often located immediately call instruction avoid extra conditional test improving efficiency
In one would write example There significant runtime calling subroutine including passing argument branching subprogram branching back caller
The overhead often includes saving restoring certain processor register allocating reclaiming call frame storage
In language subroutine call also implies automatic testing subroutine return code handling may raise
In language significant source overhead intensively used method call
There seemingly obvious optimization procedure call applied procedure may side effect
For example expression function must called twice two call may return different result
Moreover value must fetched second call since first call may changed
Determining whether subprogram may side effect difficult indeed
So optimization safe purely functional programming language compiler typical imperative programming usually assume worst
A method used eliminate overhead subprogram body versus branching subroutine back
Not avoid call overhead also allows procedure effectively taking account context argument call
The inserted body optimized compiler
Inlining however usually increase code size unless program contains one call subroutine subroutine body le code call overhead

My bos keep mentioning nonchalantly bad programmer use loop
I use time make sense let show inspiration The point first function check condition correct executes actual functionality
IMO applies loop I think make easier read debug I also see downside
When used start block first check made act like precondition good
When used middle block code around act like hidden trap bad
You could read Donald Knuth paper discus various us structurally desirable
They include equivalent statement many us developed limited construct
Is bos type call Knuth bad programmer
The example given interest
Typically disliked people like one entry one exit piece code sort person also frown multiple statement
I believe bad
The idea bad come day structured programming
It related notion function must single entry point single exit point one per function
This make sense function long multiple nested loop
However function short wrap loop body short function
Generally forcing function single exit point result convoluted logic
If function short single loop worst two nested loop loop body short clear
It also clear multiple statement
These issue addressed Clean Code Robert Martin Refactoring Martin Fowler
Bad programmer speak absolute like Sith
Good programmer use clearest solution possible
Using break continue frequently make code hard follow
But replacing make code even harder follow bad change
The example gave definitely situation break continues replaced something elegant
Most people think bad idea behaviour easily predictable
If reading code see assume going run x But break middle hold true ca really trust looping
It reason people like GOTO sure used well also lead godawful spaghetti code code leap randomly section section
For I going loop broke one condition I toggle X false I needed break
The final result would anyone reading code would know look closely thing switched value X
Yes write program without break statement return middle loop thing
But may introduce additional variable code duplication typically make program harder understand
Pascal programming language bad especially beginner programmer reason
Your bos basically want program Pascal control structure
If Linus Torvalds shoe would probably show bos middle finger
There computer science result called Kosaraju hierarchy control structure date back mentioned Knuth famous paper gotos
This paper Knuth already recommended David Thornley way
What Rao Kosaraju proved possible rewrite program break depth program break depth le without introducing extra variable
But let say purely theoretical result
Just add extra variable
Surely please bos What far important software engineering perspective recent paper Eric Roberts titled
Roberts summarizes several empirical study conducted others
For example group student asked write code function implementing sequential search array author study said following student used exit sequential search loop element found I yet find single person attempted program using style produced incorrect solution
Roberts also say Students attempted solve problem without using explicit return loop fared much le well seven student attempting strategy managed generate correct solution
That figure represents success rate le
Yes may experienced student without using break statement equivalently middle loop eventually write code nominally nicely structured hairy enough term extra logic variable code duplication someone probably put logic bug trying follow bos coding style
I also gon na say Roberts paper far accessible average programmer better first read Knuth
It also shorter cover narrower topic
You could probably even recommend bos even management rather CS type
I consider using either bad practice using much within loop warrant rethinking logic used loop
Use sparingly
The badness dependent use
I typically use break looping construct ONLY save cycle ca saved refactoring algorithm
For instance cycling collection looking item value specific property set true
If need know one item property set true achieve result break good terminate loop appropriately
If using break wo make code specifically easier read shorter run save cycle processing significant manner best use
I tend code lowest common denominator possible make sure anyone follows easily look code figure going I always successful
Breaks reduce introduce odd point
Misused behave much like whack goto statement
The example gave need break continues My line example level different thing break continue You read line
In nested approach deeper go code becomes
But deep inside find reason stop loop break return would use
I prefer use extra flag tested condition
The direct better state intent setting yet another variable
Absolutely
Yes use bad deteriorates structure program also difficult understand control flow
But use statement like absolutely necessary day considered bad programming practice
And also difficult understand control flow use
In construct like statement absolutely necessary
The essential notion come able semantically analyze program
If single entry single exit math needed denote possible state considerably easier manage forking path
In part difficulty reflects able conceptually reason code
Frankly second code obvious
What
Does continue loop
I idea
At least first example clear
I disagree bos
There proper place used
In fact reason execeptions exception handling introduced modern programming language ca solve every problem using
I want start religious discussion could restructure code even readable like I personally dislike use conditionals variable boolean already introducing additional comparison need happen value boolean answer want unless course certain compiler optimize extra comparison away
I would replace second code snippet reason terseness I actually think easier read someone understand going
Generally speaking condition loop contained purely within loop condition littered throughout body
However situation help readability
moreso I might add D I agree bos
They bad produce method high cyclomatic complexity
Such method difficult read difficult test
Fortunately easy solution
Extract loop body separate method continue becomes return
Return better return worry local state
For break extract loop separate method replacing break return
If extracted method require large number argument indication extract class either collect context object
I think problem nested deeply inside multiple loop
It hard know loop breaking
It might difficult follow continue also I think real pain come break logic difficult follow
As long used disguised goto like following example I fine
Example seen production code meh I like either style
Here I would prefer I really like using abort function
It feel like abuse
Using also always clear read
Better yet might le nesting complex condition refactored variable real program better name obviously All code It way solve problem way solve
Many current mainstream language Java C VB PHP write use break continue skip loop
They structured goto sentence
Without With Note break continue code shorter usually turn sentence foreach sentence
Both case matter coding style
verbose style allows control code
I actually work project mandatory use sentence
Some developer may think necesarilly hypothetical remove remove repeat pascal guy also Conclusion even I prefer use I principle I think construct often replaced something even better
I using C example consider case wanting iterate collection want element fulfil predicate want maximum iteration
This look REASONABLY clean
It hard understand
I think would stand gain lot declarative though
Compare following Maybe Where Take call even method
Maybe filtering done BEFORE collection passed method
Anyway moving away stuff focusing actual business logic becomes clear ACTUALLY interested
It becomes easier separate code cohesive module adhere good design practice
stuff still exist part code want hide much possible take mental energy could using reason business problem instead
nice section using multiple return routine loop
In general bad practice
tell exactly happens next
And I agree

rewrite loop us one loop construct loop us one
The loop following form
The execution loop start evaluating Boolean expression
If condition evaluates body loop executed body executed execution go back loop condition
If loop condition evaluates skip loop body continue executing program following loop
The following loop compute sum number
It start initializing variable variable
We use variable accumulate sum number covered far variable used count number
The loop body execute value counter variable time execute body increase current value increase counter variable one
The loop following form
The difference loop loop loop condition executed execute body loop
That loop execution start executing loop body loop condition evaluated first time
If loop condition evaluates execution jump back beginning loop execute body
If hand loop body evaluates exit loop continue program following loop
The loop therefore executes body loop convenient situation
The loop must terminated semicolon
The following loop computes sum number
The loop following form
It convenient remember loop term corresponding loop achieves effect
The following program us loop compute sum number
Notice example separate initial statement loop condition statement using semicolon statement inside initial statement separated using comma
As see loop useful writing provides u mean initialize counter variable n loop condition control number time execute loop used increase counter
In example used counting loop knew advance many time would like execute loop body
This example show use loop performs computation result achieved
Diving number amount counting many time subtract
We therefore compute division subtracting long possible time perform subtraction count
When subtraction longer possible count result division value left remainder division
In previous class wrote game user get guess number time
We copying necessary code time
Using loop compact way
We use loop count number guess far
In addition use use indicate user guessed number correctly exit loop
In following program read sequence positive number input find maximal among
We use number indicate end input
In case use loop since want execute loop body least user enter least one number
The body loop contain statement include loop
The following program print multiplication table number
The main loop outer loop iterating loop responsible iterating row multiplication table
The inner loop iterating value print row corresponding multiplied number
Note use special character represents tabulator tab
When print character console automatically tabulates output producing nicer table
A number divisible
We check number prime checking divisible number
If divisible number number prime
The following program us loop iterate number check dive number
If divide use indicator variable mark prime
We use indicator variable loop condition exit loop soon find number
Since know check number prime write program print prime number
We using two nested loop
The outer loop iterate number inner loop one check whether current number prime
The program output prime number

I recently heard term hook talking people program I writing
I unsure exactly term implies although I inferred conversation hook type function
I searched definition unable find good answer
Would someone able give idea term generally mean perhaps small example illustrate definition
Essentially place code allows tap module either provide different behavior react something happens
A hook functionality provided software user software code called certain circumstance
That code augment replace current code
In olden day computer truly personal virus le prevalent I talking simple patching operating system software call code
I remember writing extension Applesoft BASIC language Apple II simply hooked code BASIC interpreter injecting call code line processed
Some computer hook one example stream Apple II
It used hook inject whole disk Apple II ROMs originally built day cassette primary storage medium PCs
You controlled disk ASCII code followed command wanted execute intercepted disk hooked Apple ROM print routine
So example line would list disk content machine
This allowed trick protecting BASIC program setting first line using insert character
Then anyone trying list source would send sequence output routine disk would detect
That often sort trickery resort get behavior wanted
Nowadays operating system secure provides facility hook since longer supposed modify operating system disk
They around time
Mainframes called exit great deal mainframe software us facility even
For example free source code control system come called SCLM allows entirely replace security subsystem simply placing code exit
In generic sense hook something let programmer view interact change something already going
For example Drupal CMS provides developer hook let take additional action content node created
If developer implement hook node created per normal
If developer implement hook additional code run whenever node created
This code could anything including rolling back altering original action
It could also something unrelated node creation entirely
A callback could thought specific kind hook
By implementing callback functionality system system letting call additional code action completed
However hooking generic term limited callback
Another example
Sometimes Web Developers refer class name IDs element hook
That placing name element use Javascript modify element hook page document
stretching meaning commonly used worth mentioning programming technique employing hook make chain procedure event handler
Hooks category function allows base code call extension code
This useful situation core developer want offer extensibility without exposing code
One usage hook video game mod development
A game may allow mod developer extend base functionality hook added core mod library developer
With hook independent developer custom code called upon desired event game loading inventory update entity interaction etc
A common method implementation give function empty list callback expose ability extend list callback
The base code always call function proper time empty callback list function nothing
This design
A third party opportunity write additional code add new callback hook callback list
With nothing reference available hook extended functionality minimal risk base system
Hooks allow developer anything ca done structure interface
They choice made consideration task user developer
For clarification hook allows extension may implemented using callback
Callbacks generally nothing function pointer computed address function
There appears confusion
Hook denotes place code dispatch event certain type event registered proper function call back would handled registered function otherwise nothing happens
Simple said A hook mean executing custom code function either instead existing code
For example function may written hook login process order execute Captcha function continuing normal login process
hook executed condition encountered

variable change action called event happens
hook enter process change thing react upon change
Oftentimes hooking refers equivalent generically hooking simply notifying another want notified specified action happens
For instance Having window system notify close
As general rule hooking somewhat hazardous since without understanding affect system lead instability lea unexpected behaviour
It also VERY useful certain circumstance thought
For instance us determine window show FPS counter
In Drupal content management system relatively specific meaning
When internal event occurs like content creation user login example module respond event implementing special hook function
This done via naming convention User Login event example
Because convention underlying event referred hook appear name like Drupal API documentation
A chain hook set function function call next
What significant chain hook programmer add another function chain run time
One way look known location address first function chain kept
You save value function pointer overwrite value initial address address function wish insert hook chain
The function get called business call next function chain unless decide otherwise
Naturally number way create chain hook writing directly memory using metaprogramming facility language like Ruby Python
An example chain hook way MS Windows application process message
Each function processing chain either process message sends next function chain
In VERY short change code API call different function edited globally work system wide locally work process wide

also called performs various action continuously autonomously behalf individual organization
For example agent may archive various computer file retrieve electronic message regular schedule
Such simple task barely begin tap potential us agent however
This intelligent agent observe behaviour pattern user learn anticipate need least repetitive action
Such intelligent agent frequently rely technique field aim achieve complex goal
Intelligent agent posse varying degree mobility symbolic model reality capacity learn experience ability cooperate agent system
An intelligent agent frequently classified role performs
For example Web spider continually Web index site often built agent
Thus far agent developed Internet assistance
Chatterbots another type Internet agent provide assistance visitor conducting determine need service routine request
In criminal us agent botnets order attack computer system message attack
Mobile agent expected become particularly useful gathering Internet article academic research paper electronic newspaper magazine match user interest
Simple agent also used trading eBay electronic auction site well various electronic exchange
Elaborate system constructed agent meet represent interest principal negotiation collaboration
In addition electronic marketplace collaborative project agent provides portion necessary information development
kind agent software term program carry routine task user
They stem artificial intelligence research carry task librarian severe disadvantage
Although Web page may index term ability digital computer robot perform task commonly associated intelligent being
The term frequently applied project developing system endowed intellectual process characteristic human ability reason discover meaning generalize learn computer program us method solve problem within specialized domain ordinarily requires human expertise
The first expert system developed Edward Feigenbaum Joshua Lederberg Stanford University California Dendral expert system later known computer program operates manner inspired natural neural network brain

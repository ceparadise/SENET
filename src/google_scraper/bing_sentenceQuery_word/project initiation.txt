The one significant artifact project management provides foundation business project
PID bundle information acquired Initiating Project process controlled project environment
renaming Document Documentation indicates collection documentation collected creating project rather information system
The Project Initiation Document provides reference point throughout project customer
A Project Initiation Document often contains following document could created instead PID document implies significant similarity
Project Charter le detailed suitable detailed document resource write
The Project Initiation Documentation term representing plan approach project management
It assembled series document including communication plan Project Tolerances specific project control inspection part departmental quality plan common project approach
The PID represents detailed version basic project document called Project Brief
The PID bundle together documentation form logical document brings together key information needed start run project sound basis
It conveyed stakeholder agreed signed
In short part project
It defines major aspect project form basis management assessment overall success
The project initiation document build upon business case exists using information analysis data produced initiation activity
A common part formal project methodology document major process
It document go commence project
The Project Initiation Document provides reference point throughout project customer Project Team
The purpose Project Initiation Document PID capture record basic information needed correctly define plan project
The PID expand upon Project Mandate state project aiming planning achieve reason importance meeting aim
It also contains list people participating project development beginning project closure along role responsibility
The PID also includes date PID approved Project Board
The PID regularly updated project stage
Any revision update needed done end stage order incorporate detailed milestone next step
The Project Initiation Document basis decision taken project nothing worse PID queried later stage PID change made reference
One important section PID
Project divided three part Project Scope Statement Proposed Solution In Scope Project Example
That part PID explaining depth project delivering Stakeholders customer
Proposed Solution explains innovation change aspect project bring within environment society change renewal cause
The Project Scope Statement include much detail possible help avoid proliferating problem question project lifecycle requirement needed order succeed In Scope Category
In Scope phase help make decision financial aspect project expense
Project Background establish project created
Phase project deliver online functionality required together change necessary Business Systems impacted whilst Phase deliver Digital Rights Management advert insertion
The person played pivotal role project participation mentioned section PID
It rational way make specific project others emphasizing attention participation active candidate team
It someone important within company want see
The result equipment made available ensure project happens
Assumptions Constraints detail Project Initiation Document
Those detail assumed ahead Business Requirements Specification documented
Project Constraints PID identifies outer impact unavailability resource competitor another project
In order complete organization stage team need complete Organization Chart
The project achieved team experienced representative multiple department including Development Interactive Test Networking Infrastructure Business Systems Security Marketing
The involvement different area vary project progress initial project
The SMG Senior management Group notified key finding development
During whole process creating Project Initiation Document Project manager aware attending meeting Lead Architects Team Leaders discussion Project Management Reports Weekly project team meeting Fortnightly supplier meeting Weekly programme board meeting take place
Project Quality Plan usually written ITQA IT Quality Assurance identifies aspect delivered part project Baselined Project Plan BRS HLD SRS Test Scripts Test Report Post Development Review PDR Stage Assessments Project Quality Plan
ITQA also determines End Stage Assessment ESA taking place
These basically checkpoint life project ensure Quality product delivered
ESA implies meeting considering Baselined Project Plan ensure date Project Management Reports Project Workstream Checkpoint Reports Team Meeting Minutes Actions Agenda Quality Plan Tip
Writing Initial Plan PID implies adequate reconsideration proposed date detail phase accordingly
Often business stakeholder ask project delivered impossible date requires highlight fact
In case stakeholder flexible reconsider launch date reducing scope
Relaunching date reducing scope need supported justification stakeholder making decision delaying launch date
The sooner worker start building sort relationship stakeholder easier later pressing concern regarding scope raised
There specific number section needed completed term controlling whole project Project Stages Exception Process
Those could include Budget Actuals forecast produced financial period Exceptions escalated Corporate Programme Manager Product review Quality Plan Project Tolerance Risk Mitigation Plan identifying project risk plan mitigation Issues Log Existing Change Control Processes weekly Highlight Report Corporate Program Board weekly supplier meeting weekly project team meeting etc
The rule stay commit need deliver
The Initiation Requirements Design Development Test Project Launch Close Exception Process stage
The last stage unstable cover much Budget Time Project Scope could increase without project forced go Exception
In situation stakeholder decide relocate project Exception detailed Exception Plan needed introduced replace version plan use Exception
And top additional paperwork Project Manager also keep project moving forward ensure team motivated
Once PID formally approved mean additional contingency utilise move Exception
This make difference successfully delivery project much way good cashflow key success growing business
Boehm identified six risk management stage Identification Assessment Prioritisation Management Planning Resolution Monitoring take place PID
The last stage writing PID Approval implies distribution Stakeholders Distribution List within PID interested party Operations request comment
Then lead team amass comment followed final meeting Stakeholders Interested Parties discus PID detail
It stage complete PID sufficient standard approved passed onto Programme Board funding
Depending complexity size project stage completed five Informal four Formal review
Some problem could appear shortage resource lack finance
It pivotally important identify prioritized project starting PID help avoid huge expense project appear Exception Stage
Success delivery product meet expectation Specifying importance project Project Initiation Documentation identifies contract project management sponsor
The aim PID understanding premise project
The correct format PID represents understanding background objective benefit
A good project manager interested delivering output capability customer interested wider context benefit capability ultimately bring
PID identifies scope within project use
The pivotal role play identification responsibility implies role project manager sponsor user representative stakeholder member
There key aspect need consideration starting creating Project Initiation Document project delivered
What type approach variegates technique

What way communication stakeholder keeping top risk issue change
For PID sufficient include place emphasize main phase activity project
The success PID whole project build visual aspect graphic galvanizing better visual memorizing project
Risks needed identified appear problem within whole project
The problem could resolved creating list top project risk precautionary measure taken
Financial side project needed considered
PID scheme need included along budgetary constrains provided assumption team used well detail often review estimate
The important aspect avoided isolation might cause mistake spelling jargon
In order improve PID could created identifying emphasizing main point

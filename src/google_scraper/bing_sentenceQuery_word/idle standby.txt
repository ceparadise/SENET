I guess know many electronic device really switched switch
Sometimes convenient
It easier switch TV remote pressing button set
This requires device standby mode able receive signal
The problem standby mode consumes power
Even many device switch physical button standby mode
The button like key electronics device constantly waiting press
Few device today except lamp button physically disconnect power
I network switch marketed green environmentally friendly feature button
In total lot power consumed device standby
I bought cheap power consumption meter see much power electronics use I using
I tested desktop computer
I use computer daily evening switched time
Or really switched
I measured amount power used I shut computer
When computer standby whole system still consumes watt
By switching device I found power consumption As see power used switch
This make sense since standby mode still
This green switch I talking turn one I pull plug
The monitor enter kind power saving state I switch computer
An interesting discovery I press standby button monitor enter deeper standby state us le power
The monitor still us power keeping busy waiting press button
OK watt huge number unnecessary since I use computer much
In future I careful switching whole system button power strip

I created new Task task scheduler I wanted running computer idle min
I saw checkbox I understand The help say If task set start computer idle minute task wait computer idle minute task launch minute computer idle minute prior time trigger activated
The task start computer enters idle state minute trigger activated
Sorry I understand explanation
min came
someone please shed light
simple word You right explanation hard follow
I try explain different way In screenshot task trigger certain time
When task trigger execute statement computer idle minute true
The task wait hour statement become true give
If computer idle minute task triggered execute immediately
Otherwise wait
If computer becomes idle say minute task triggered task continue waiting
minute task triggered statement computer idle minute becomes true task execute
If computer become idle within minute task triggered task execute
That task stop waiting minute computer becomes idle minute task triggered statement computer idle minute wo true specified hour wait
You need actual trigger task otherwise wait idle make sense
Now read computer idle yet another become idle
And complicate little Windows evaluates computer idle every minute
So even schedule task idle minute make sure anything whole minute may still activate may actually activate depending Windows evaluates idle state
By posting answer agree

You could comfortably surf couch living room monitor size
Monitors created LCD LED
LCDs layer glass polarized film liquid crystal
You get electrical impulse sent cause color shown image displayed
LED monitor take LCD one step
They put diode back force light layer sharper picture better color
It said LED monitor last longer LCD monitor
Have decided one want go
Do forget also got touchscreen monitor available use
The practical use touchscreen monitor consumer professional use would someone physical disability
The next difficult decision make work best
Printers used create tangible product look away monitor
For consumer use two kind choose inkjet laser printer
The printer us liquid ink sprayed print head onto piece paper
How
Simply put printer interprets signal computer convert instruction go print head
Inkjet printer typically inexpensive purchase although replacement ink costly add
printer use heat technology specialized powder called toner another medium I seen wax looked like crayon onto piece paper
Laser printer somewhat expensive though come cost technology increased
Get FREE access day create account
Both type often available printer printer
An printer typically printer copier scanner
Some still fax feature well
You ask much printing often
If print much inkjet printer may
One disadvantage though printing often inkjet printer print head actually plug dry work
If print frequently large quantity may find purchasing ink quite often
Ink varies price range sheet black ink
The toner laser printer seems prohibitive usually print sheet paper per cartridge
These toner unit
An example typical usage several year ago I bought printer actually
It used create syllabus seven different class class daughter write paper high school class son discovered SpongeBob Internet printed hundred coloring sheet I prepared least tax return season
The one toner cartridge lasted year
If made decision printer look last two common output method speaker eBooks
used emit audio signal may come music file audio file
Many computer come external speaker
All come internal speaker
Usually external speaker included good enough sound quality whether watching YouTube video playing movie DVD player
There people prefer little bump audio output however
Speakers available system rival home system
How loud want system
The sound system expensive
The opposite loud quiet typically
This electronic portable data storage device allows u bring read large quantity book magazine even document u wherever go
Some eBooks also speaker music player built well
eBooks range screen device basic monochrome screen function read
You pick output device computer system important remember output device let u see working working well get feel finished product look like
available inkjet laser color
They used give tangible product viewing
fun shop
They allowing transmission sound file user hear
You pick loud want system find sound package work
Finally electronic portable data storage device used bring reading material along without bulk bound book magazine

A computer program typically used provide form consists primarily set rule behavior
These rule termed basic found useful
A production system provides mechanism necessary execute production order achieve goal system
Productions consist two part sensory precondition IF statement action THEN
If production precondition match current world production said
If production action said
A production system also contains database sometimes called maintains data current state knowledge rule interpreter
The rule interpreter must provide mechanism prioritizing production one triggered
Rule interpreter generally execute algorithm selecting production execute meet current goal include updating system data
The condition portion rule LHS tested current state working memory
In idealized production system assumption triggered condition executed consequent action RHS update agent knowledge removing adding data working memory
The system stop processing either user interrupt forward chaining loop given number cycle performed halt RHS executed rule LHSs true
expert system contrast often choose mutually exclusive production since action take time one action taken case expert system recommended
In system rule interpreter cycle two step matching production rule database followed selecting matched rule apply executing selected action
Production system may vary expressive power condition production rule
Accordingly algorithm collect production rule matched condition may range rule sequence stopping first optimized rule compiled network condition
The latter illustrated algorithm designed used series production system called OPS originally developed culminating early eighty
may viewed programming language production system programming
Production system may also differ final selection production rule execute
The collection rule resulting previous matching algorithm called selection process also called
Here strategy may vary order production rule written assign weight priority production rule sort conflict set conflict set according time production rule previously fired according extent modification induced RHSs
Whichever conflict resolution strategy implemented method indeed crucial efficiency correctness production system
Some system simply fire matching production
The use production system varies simple string rule modeling human cognitive process term rewriting reduction system
This example show set production rule reversing string alphabet contain symbol used marker symbol
In example production rule chosen testing according order production list
For rule input string examined left right moving window find match LHS production rule
When match found matched substring input string replaced RHS production rule
In production system x matching character input string alphabet
Matching resume replacement made
The string ABC instance undergoes following sequence transformation production rule In simple system ordering production rule crucial
Often lack control structure make production system difficult design
It course possible add control structure production system model namely inference engine working memory
In toy simulation world monkey room grab different object climb others example production rule grab object suspended ceiling would look like In example data working memory structured variable appear angle bracket
The name data structure goal first literal condition field structure prefixed
The indicates negative condition
Production rule apply instance data structure match condition conform variable binding
In example several object suspended ceiling different ladder nearby supporting monkey conflict set would contain many production rule instance derived production Holds
The conflict resolution step would later select production instance fire
Note binding variable resulting pattern matching LHS used RHS refer data modified
Note also working memory contains explicit control structure data form goal data structure instance
In example monkey hold suspended object status goal set satisfied production rule longer apply first condition fails

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In information technology product something example software application created made available customer usually distinct name order number
In mathematics product result arithmetically multiplying number quantity
There two term many hundred thousand million
Some product contain infinitely many term
For product relatively term number multiplicand written one another separated multiplication sign x
An example x x
This becomes awkward number term large
When product infinitely many term term must occur definable sequence
This sequence always clear term simply listed separated multiplication symbol
For reason product symbol devised large uppercase Greek letter pi
To denote x x following symbology used The expression side equation product
The value always integer
It usually start always increase succeeding term product
Suppose sequence multiplicand extended without limit according obvious pattern
Then product unlimited value x x x x denoted like The sideways called mean continues increase without limit
It imprecise say dealing product terminology often used anyway

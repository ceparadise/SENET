Carlos real estate mogul recently purchased two small apartment complex
One small complex unit much larger three level total unit
Before Carlos begin leasing tenant want renovation give complex modern look
After several discussion Carlos Al contractor finally agree following schedule budget renovation After two month renovation Carlos decides check Al see renovation going
Carlos want make sure renovation track completed schedule budget
Al give Carlos following report But number alone enough tell Carlos status project
He need calculate schedule variance
The status update indicates much ahead behind schedule project based much work done much budget spent
To determine schedule variance Carlos need calculate difference project worth current stage completion project worth based much work completed
The formula look like Schedule Variance SV Earned Value EV Planned Value PV Once planned value deducted earned value remaining value reveals whether project ahead behind schedule
A positive schedule variance mean project ahead schedule negative schedule variance mean project behind schedule
If schedule variance zero project schedule
But tell u far ahead behind let take step
Using schedule variance Carlos also calculate degree project ahead behind schedule dividing schedule variance planned value
The resulting percentage represents much project ahead behind schedule
Percentage Schedule Variance SV Schedule Variance SV Planned Value PV Similar schedule variance positive schedule variance percentage reveals degree project ahead schedule negative schedule variance percentage reveals degree project behind schedule
A value zero indicates project going planned schedule
Let see formula action
Carlos using information calculate schedule variance percentage schedule variance
To calculate schedule variance complex Carlos deduct planned value earned value leaving schedule variance
SV SV The positive value let Carlos know renovation complex ahead schedule
Now Carlos need know far ahead schedule Al renovation

In blog post going discus Schedule Variance SV Cost Variance CV
Okay let get started
If running project client asks inform status project
whether progress planned lagging
Now tell get information
You get information Schedule Variance analysis update client
However client asks spending
whether spending budget analyze Cost Variance
Schedule Variance Cost Variance give important information project progress must keep watching regularly
This Variance Analysis key success project
A successful project must finish time within approved budget
If plan realistic easily monitor project performance help Variance Analysis take corrective action whenever required
Variance Analysis tell going correct direction
Keeping project schedule important
Not help complete project time also help avoid unnecessary cost overrun due slippage schedule
Because cross stipulated time cost start rising exponentially
For example rented equipment certain period
However need equipment extra day may end paying equipment may available previously negotiated price
That Schedule Variance important analytical tool
This tool give information far behind ahead schedule
The Schedule Variance measure schedule performance project
Formula calculate Schedule Variance Schedule Variance Earned Value Planned Value Or SV EV PV Please note Given question Actual Cost AC Planned Value PV Earned Value EV Now Schedule Variance SV Earned Value EV Planned Value PV Hence The Schedule Variance USD since Schedule Variance negative behind schedule
Of course Cost Variance equally important Schedule Variance
You must complete project within approved budget
It bad client project cost cross boundary
Cost Variance deal cost baseline project
It give information whether spending budget
The Cost Variance measure cost performance project
Cost Variance Earned Value Actual Cost Or CV EV AC Please note Given question Actual Cost AC Earned Value EV Now Cost Variance CV Earned Value EV Actual Cost AC CV EV AC Hence The Cost Variance USD since Cost Variance negative budget
Keep mind variance positive always good indicates going correct direction negative indicates something wrong going incorrect direction
This Schedule Variance Cost Variance
If something add comment section
In next blog post discus performance index
If interested learning mathematical formula PMP exam try practice PMP exam sample question
image credit I miscalculated
Please find correct calculation follows Cost Variance lower Schedule Variance
CV SV EV AC EV PV AC PV Hence A correct

If interested learning mathematical formula PMP exam try learn practice mathematical question
It really helpful helped grasping concept variance thnkyou sharing You welcome
I dont think completion SV example month work done got SV
What would happen month work completed
SV completion
Also month work done
Could please clarify
would I receive email answer
I come everyday
Once project completed mean planned value earned
EV PV The rest calculate substituting data formula
question effect CV
The blog say CV Under Budget
Lets see make sense BAC Total Budget USD
As project completed total cost USD
So AC
Since work completed EV BAC BAC CV EV AC
In layman term I budgeted finished wok good I save
Shouldn mean Budget Estimate actual
And CV actually good
Sorry somehow I unable digest CV always good mean budget This mean budget calculation wrong must correct soon discover
Fahad Can help answering test question What would best explanation following cost variance schedule variance negative cost variance lower schedule variance
A project activity look longer expected cost lower B project spent due increased cost yet completed activity faster C project underspent work completed overspent work done
D project underspent cost lower planned activity easier complete planned
As per first statement variance negative mean project budget behind schedule
Now come second point
Cost Variance lower Schedule Variance
CV SV EV PV EV AC PV AC AC PV It mean Actual Cost le Planned Cost
Now say project behind schedule taking longer time expected actual cost lower planned cost
Therefore given option I think A correct answer
hi interchanged formula CV SV CV AC SV Cost Variance lower Schedule Variance
CV SV PV AC planned value le actual cost answer B Hello Tejal There error commenting system causing sign appear wrongly I written comment end blog post
You check end blog post
I come conclusion A
Unfortunately correct answer C
Following given explanation Remember variance negative bad
In situation variance negative
To answer question first look four choice exhibit negative variance cost schedule
Since project underspent work completed overspent work done cost schedule variance negative
I miscalculated
Please find correct calculation follows Cost Variance lower Schedule Variance
CV SV AC PV Hence A correct
C correct answer
Sorry giving wrong answer
Anyway Cost Variance would Schedule Variance A correct answer
I noticed content comment appearing I written
Some text gone missing causing confusing
I tried correct failed therefore I posting comment bottom post
Please go find correct explanation
Hey Ravindra correct response answer understand I think clean way act make open consult doubt providing complete information expert
Please let know agree thank
Arturo Can anyone explain scenario
Planned Star Date March Planned End Date March Actual Start Date March Actual End Date March In condition time taken day considered Schedule Variance delayed delivery
Kindly provide concrete solution

Let say large collection task collection identical term performance processor operate completely parallel
For scenario interest may assume n
Each take amount complete assigned processor assigned reassigned completed processor always eventually complete assigned task
Let assume take amount known advance taken discrete random distribution
For question even assume simple distribution P P pairwise independent
Therefore
Suppose statically task assigned evenly possible processor uniformly random processor assigned task well assume n purpose question
We call makespan last processor finish assigned work finish work assigned
First question As function n makespan M
Specifically E M
Var M
Second question Suppose P P pairwise independent
As function n new makespan
More interestingly compare answer first part
Some simple thought experiment demonstrate answer latter makespan longer
But quantified
I happy post example either controversial b unclear
Depending success one I post question dynamic assignment scheme assumption
Thanks advance
If n task scheduled processor
The makespan M time complete n task complete sequential fashion
Therefore E M E E E E Var M Var Var Var Var It seems like might possible use result answer question simply need find expression close approximation n n n n random variable n n
Is heading right direction
As k n look term k n instead n
Let say time take processor finish work
As n grows probability processor assigned task approach makespan defined max E M approach
For second scenario increasing number processor make split better
What k increasing number task per processor
Increasing k opposite effect make le likely processor unlucky set task
I going home I come back later
My hunch k grows difference E M split split disappears E M becomes
So I would assume always better except maybe special case small specific value k n even
So summarize I find heuristic argument often quite misleading considering task scheduling closely related problem like bin packing
Things happen
For simple case worthwhile actually probability theory
Let n km k positive integer
Suppose ij time taken complete j task given processor
This random variable mean variance
The expected makespan first case E M E ij
The sum iid mean variance assuming ij iid stronger pairwise independence
Now obtain expectation maximum one either need information distribution one settle bound applied sum iid
This would necessarily case underlying time pairwise independent
In particular Theorem expected makespan bounded E M k
Downey also give particular distribution achieving bound although distribution change n exactly natural
Note bound say expected makespan increase parameter increase variance number processor n number task per processor k
For second question scenario resulting makespan seems unlikely outcome thought experiment
Let X denote makespan first distribution Y second parameter
Here denote sum k task duration corresponding processor two distribution
For x independence yield Pr X x Pr x Pr x Pr Y x
Since mass probability distribution maximum mean E X therefore tend larger E Y
This completely rigorous answer short second case seems preferable
By posting answer agree

The budget completion BAC total operating budget allocated project
In earned value reporting system BAC point end BCWS PV line chart see Figure
Since BCWS line plot budget task project time point end line point time project scheduled complete point vertical axis corresponding end line total project budget
Note BAC include allowance contingency budget management reserve
As contingency Figure Figure management reserve used removed reserve added operating budget needed approved
Cost variance CV amount money actually spent project part project compared amount work actually accomplished
Cost variance budgeted cost work performed minus actual cost work performed
In earned value reporting system project concerned knowing project respect amount money spent accomplishment achieved
The measure comparison cost variance
To compute cost variance compare work actually completed actual amount spent accomplish
This mean comparing budgeted cost work performed BCWP actual cost work performed ACWP see Figure
People always trouble remembering thing
They get mixed end positive variance really negative variance
It good remember bad variance always negative good variance always positive
If consider completed project task actual cost le planned could say good variance positive value
If hand spent accomplish task plan allowed could say bad condition variance negative number
Of course must qualified
Just positive cost variance always mean something good
If cost variance positive left required work would good thing
A good rule thumb variance whether positive negative investigated
The cost variance important figure project manager manager company indicator well project term spending budget
It used predict forecast much money cost finish project
Suppose project progress today ACWP BCWP BCWS
What cost variance
Cost variance difference work really accomplished BCWP cost work ACWP
Schedule variance comparison amount money planned spent project part project amount work actually accomplished
In earned value reporting system project concerned knowing project respect actual work done BCWP amount work expected completed BCWS
The measure comparison schedule variance
It may seem bit odd would measuring schedule variance term dollar since u used hearing project ahead behind schedule many day week month
Measuring schedule variance dollar actually indicative way showing
If often case say ahead behind schedule three week might serious one person working one task three week
On hand might quite serious one hundred people working twenty task behind three week
If person time worth per week earned value report schedule variance first condition might say schedule variance
The second condition would schedule variance
This quite noticeable difference two situation project three week behind schedule
So really make lot sense consider project schedule ahead behind term dollar rather week month
To compute schedule variance compare work actually completed work planned accomplished
This mean comparing budgeted cost work performed BCWP EV budgeted cost work scheduled BCWS PV
As cost variance people often trouble remembering calculation
They get mixed end positive variance really negative variance
It good remember bad variance always negative good variance always positive
If consider completed project task greater planned could say good variance positive value
If hand accomplished fewer task plan allowed could say bad condition variance negative number
The schedule variance important figure project manager manager company indicator well project term following project schedule
It used predict forecast much time take finish project
Suppose project progress today ACWP BCWP BCWS
Schedule variance difference work really accomplished BCWP planned work supposed accomplished BCWS

In field transaction management system abstract model describe execution transaction running system
Often operation action ordered time performed set executed together system
If order time certain operation determined system used
Examples operation requesting read operation reading writing aborting committing requesting lock locking etc
Not transaction operation type included schedule typically selected operation type data access operation included needed reason describe certain phenomenon
Schedules schedule property fundamental concept database theory
The following example schedule In example horizontal axis represents different transaction schedule The vertical axis represents time order operation
Schedule D consists three transaction
The schedule describes action transaction seen
First Reads Writes object X Commits
Then Reads Writes object Y Commits finally Reads Writes object Z Commits
This example schedule sequential overlap time action three transaction sequential transaction interleaved time
Representing schedule D table rather list convenience identifying transaction operation glance
This notation used throughout article
A common way technical literature representing schedule list Usually purpose reasoning concurrency control database operation modeled occurring point time without duration
When satisfactory start end possibly point event specified rarely
Real executed operation always duration specified respective time occurrence event within exact time beginning completion concurrency control reasoning usually precedence time whole operation without looking quite complex detail operation matter operation another operation
Furthermore many case relationship two specific operation matter specified specified pair operation
In general operation transaction schedule interleave transaction executed concurrently time order operation transaction remain unchanged implied transaction program
Since always time order operation transaction matter need specified schedule general operation rather order pair determined list operation
Also general case transaction may consist several process properly represented partial order operation rather total order
Thus general schedule partial order operation containing partial order transaction
two operation represented operation existence pair mean always schedule general case ordered pair
Such set schedule represented DAG operation node cycle allowed since cycle mean first operation cycle another second operation cycle contradicts perception
In many case graphical representation graph used demonstrate schedule
Since list operation table notation used article always represents total order operation schedule total order represented list always represented DAG
The transaction executed see example serial schedule one transaction start running transaction ended
A schedule equivalent outcome serial schedule property
In schedule E order action transaction executed D end E give result Two action said conflict conflicting pair The following set action conflicting While following set action The schedule said following two condition satisfied A schedule said schedule one serial schedule
Another definition schedule graph committed transaction considered acyclic graph defined include also uncommitted transaction cycle involving uncommitted transaction may occur without conflict serializability violation
Which serial schedule
A schedule said obeys CO also schedule property
This mean order time transaction commitment event compatible precedence partial order respective transaction induced schedule acyclic precedence graph serializability graph conflict graph
This implies also
The CO property especially effective achieving distributed system
discovered obviously mentioned
Its correct definition appears however description related technique theory partial inaccurate misleading
For extensive coverage commitment ordering source see
Two schedule said following condition satisfied A schedule said serial schedule
Note definition schedule
Notice example example discussion time
There however schedule schedule transaction performing The example since serial schedule
Since determining whether schedule little practical interest
Transactions commit transaction whose change read commit
These schedule recoverable
F recoverable commits make value read correct
Then commit
In aborted abort value A read incorrect
In case database left consistent state
If transaction abort transaction commits relied unrecoverable schedule
In example G unrecoverable read value A written committed
later aborted therefore value read wrong since committed schedule unrecoverable
Also named cascadeless
Avoids single transaction abort lead series transaction rollback
A strategy prevent cascading abort disallow transaction reading uncommitted change another transaction schedule
The following example one discussion recoverable In example although recoverable avoid cascading abort
It seen abort aborted order maintain correctness schedule already read uncommitted value written
The following recoverable schedule avoids cascading abort
Note however update A always lost since aborted
Note Schedule would serializable would committed
Cascading abort avoidance sufficient necessary schedule recoverable
A schedule strict strictness property two transaction write operation precedes operation either read write commit abort event also precedes conflicting operation
Any strict schedule cascadeless converse
Strictness allows efficient recovery database failure
The following expression illustrate hierarachical containment relationship class The illustrates clause graphically
In practice general purpose database system employ recoverable primarily strict schedule

CPI number useful assessing whether project coming budget
Images Variance analysis key success project
When business place bid win contract projected schedule cost required
They key winning project presenting best bid key winning future project mention earning good reputation within industry keeping project time within budget
Variance analysis quickly show project manager project running astray
Keeping project schedule important time standpoint also avoid future cost overage
When project loses site scheduled work overtime even often required finish project completion date
This run project cost significantly budget
Keeping project schedule also important sending client project status report
The client want know two thing Is project schedule project budget
Schedule variance analysis show project manager whether project schedule far fallen behind schedule
The manager correct scheduling issue present solution status report demonstrating client situation already control
Cost variance analysis equally important schedule variance analysis project cost obviously need stay within budget
It disastrous company client project cost exceed budgeted value
Unless good explanation overage client left poor impression company hired complete project mention le money pocket
Cost variance analysis compare budgeted cost project actual cost project line item
This quickly tell project manager portion project budget original estimated amount
For example company budgeted certain amount money cover project license permit cost county question raised fee unexpectedly License Permits budgeted line item show cost variance budget
To calculate schedule variance accountant take project planned value subtract project earned value
A project earned value take scheduled amount work compare actual work completed date planned value ass cost scheduled work budgeted comparison cost work actually completed date
So earned value look hour planned value look cost
A positive result project hour exceed project cost date present schedule variance indicates project schedule
A negative result project cost exceed project hour present schedule variance indicates project behind schedule amount work actually paid exceeds amount scheduled work performed
Cost variance much easier calculate accountant simply take earned value line item subtracts actual cost line item
Taking license permit cost example discussed previously company projected line item actual cost cost variance line item budget would negative showing budgeted line item projected cost
If budgeted permit license actually cost cost variance would show positive showing actual cost budget result client would appreciate

Reduce reuse recycle three essential component consumer behavior
sometimes called waste hierarchy
Here hierarchy might apply computer Sometimes fourth R added three basic one generally standing either rethink recover
Rethink sometimes added front hierarchy meaning consider option think impact environment
Recover last R refers practice putting waste product use
For example decomposing garbage produce methane gas one greenhouse gas landfill site recover burn energy rather letting dissipate

action practice using something whether original purpose conventional reuse fulfil different function
It distinguished breaking used item make manufacture new product
Reuse taking reprocessing previously used item help save time money energy resource
In broader economic term make quality product available people organization limited mean generating job business activity contribute economy
Historically financial motivation one main driver reuse
In developing world driver lead high level reuse however rising wage consequent consumer demand convenience product made reuse low value item packaging uneconomic richer country leading demise many reuse program
Current environmental awareness gradually changing attitude regulation new packaging regulation gradually beginning reverse situation
One example conventional reuse doorstep delivery refillable example include use plastic box instead box
Reuse certain potential advantage Disadvantages also apparent These service facilitate transaction redistribution unwanted yet perfectly usable material equipment one entity another
The entity benefit either side service donor seller recipient buyer business nonprofit school community group individual
Some maintain physical space reuse center others act matching service virtual exchange
Reuse center generally maintain warehouse truck
They take possession donated material make available redistribution sale
Virtual exchange physical space truck instead allow user post listing material available wanted free low cost online material exchange website
Staff help facilitate exchange material without ever taking possession material
Virtual exchangees include Consumer resource exist exchanging usable material site often grassroots entirely nonprofit movement people giving getting stuff free town
It reuse keeping good stuff landfill
Membership normally free
In addition resource point consumer local national location reuse repurposing material normally accepted program
With technological innovation new application shorter product lifetime ever increasing quantity waste electrical electronic equipment
The environmental pressure associated well documented include material energy loss increase air water land pollution waste treatment method
The incorrect disposal treatment electrical electronic equipment also pose threat human health particularly involving illegal export
One way address increase product longevity either extending product first life addressing issue repair reuse recycling
Reusing product therefore extending use item beyond point discarded first user preferable recycling disposal least energy intensive solution although often overlooked
The EU Circular Economy Package recognises importance extending product lifetime includes repair reuse product action plan ensure product reach optimum lifespan
If target reducing greenhouse gas emission reached reuse need included part whole life cycle approach
A strong second hand exists charity shop high street car boot sale online auction site maintaining popularity regular TV show featuring buying selling auction
Inadequate repair infrastructure However reuse electrical electronic equipment product remains low due inadequate infrastructure lack repair network product
Local authority collection system better suited handling waste handling good preserving reuse potential
Retailer delivery staff trained handle good carefully
So need radical rethink move unwanted still useable item market place
Is case changing approach producer responsibility insisting producer finance collection reuse additionally drive consumer choice reuse repair remanufacture whilst addressing cost recycling disposal
There opportunity producer waste management company local authority make repair reuse habitual whilst require change householder behaviour change raising awareness also require investment infrastructure logistical operation
Is time insist product designed longer lifetime
That disassembled repaired reused recycled
Business model providing opportunity This would necessarily poor strategy business business model provide opportunity retain ownership valuable product component leasing servicing repair
While choice made consumer ultimately determine success venture huge potential reuse good material deliver social economic environmental benefit
The EU Circular Economy Package Scottish Circular Economy Strategy national reuse target set Spanish Government example government recognising good good value mainstream option working towards making reuse easier consumer
In environmental term reuse ought common recycling energy recovery financial environmental cost simple refurbishment product fraction original manufacturing cost
If going serious living Circular Economy need recognise value waste ensure resource kept economy longer slow use valuable raw material ensure product reused material recycled rather landfilled
The involved reuse organization repair overhaul industry take valuable part CRTs refurbish factory environment order meet specification new product
copy machine example refurbishing factory USA
large aircraft remanufacturing factory Singapore recently announced opening tractor refurbishing plant China
Some factory operate competition OEM
When refurbished item resold new label used monitor CRTs made TVs camera resold new label found legal court
When item resold OEM name informally considered gray market item sold used legal represented OEM product eligible considered counterfeit black market
The automobile part industry USA governed law disclosure used part state used required sanitized destroyed
Whether law place protect consumer black market item protect manufacturer hindsight obsolescence often area intense debate
Fuji Photo Film Jazz Photo recent example war patent holder refurbishing factory
To quote District Court New Jersey program offer customer financial incentive return reuse
Although longer common international experience showing still effective way encourage packaging reuse
However financial incentive unless great may le incentive convenience statistic show average milk bottle returned time whereas lemonade bottle deposit returned average time
Refillable bottle used extensively many European country example bottle refillable returned consumer
These system typically supported regulation
Sainsbury Ltd operated cash refund scheme penny back scheme
The scheme reported save tonne plastic per annum
The scheme extended penny back voucher contributed school registered scheme estimate raise saving plastic tonne per annum
In developing nation like India Pakistan cost new bottle often force manufacturer collect refill old glass bottle selling drink
India Pakistan also way reusing old newspaper Kabadiwalas buy reader scrap value reuse packaging recycle
Scrap intermediary help consumer dispose material including metal plastic
These apply primarily item packaging example company involved regular transportation good central manufacturing facility warehouse warehouse retail outlet
In case considerable benefit using reusable transport packaging plastic crate pallet
The benefit reuse primarily due low additional transport cost involved empty lorry returning empty crate
There recent attempt get public join closed loop reuse scheme shopper use reusable plastic basket place carrier bag transporting good home supermarket basket fit specially designed trolley making shopping supposedly easier
There initiative encourage packaging reuse company introducing certain commodity mainly soap powder cleaning fluid content transferred use reusable package kept customer saving packaging passed onto customer lower shelf price
The refill pack reused minimal package carrying product home requires le material one durability feature reclosable top convenient shape etc
required easy use product avoiding transport cost emission returning reusable package factory
Some item clothes child toy often become unwanted wear due change owner need preference reused selling giving new owner
Regiving take place informally family friend neighbour environmental organisation charity give item could afford new
Other organization website new used good offered America school teacher life extended help schoolchildren
The average American example throw away pound used clothing rag
With population approximately million people translates billion pound used clothing textile tossed landfill year
This partly motivated movement whose member promise buy anything new year rely reusing item otherwise would thrown away
Reuse reduces inline program help raise money good cause
Printer reused
They sorted brand model refilled resold back manufacturer
The company refill ink reservoir resell consumer
recycled way ink cartridge using toner instead ink
This method highly efficient energy spent melting recreating cartridge
Repurposing use tool use another tool usually purpose unintended original
Typically repurposing done using item usually considered junk garbage
A good example would style house us tire insulating wall bottle glass wall
Reuse limited repeated us purpose
Examples repurposing include using tire plastic drum composting bin
A virtual exchange facilitates use waste product one process raw material another
As new life reuse finished item avoids environmental cost disposing waste obtaining new raw material may still possible nature process make avoiding production waste recycling back original process impossible
This sort scheme need far broader base currently case requires organization setting waste brokerage list currently available waste quantity available
One problem demand waste known shown material longer waste sellable commodity often price market waste cement kiln dust lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer
In former organic household waste collected used fodder pig
This integrated system made possible state control agriculture complexity continuing market economy German reunification meant system discontinued
The nutrient
nitrogen phosphorus potassium micronutrient organic matter contained excreta traditionally reused agriculture many country still reused agriculture day unfortunately often unregulated unsafe manner
This particularly problem many developing country
Mexico India Bangladesh Ghana untreated poorly treated wastewater used directly agriculture
The WHO Guidelines set framework reuse done safely following multiple barrier approach
Work led better understanding wastewater reuse safely implemented practice
Reuse sanitised excreta agriculture also called closing loop approach sanitation agriculture central approach
Determining balance several effect reuse interact often best accomplished formal
For example research shown reusing product reduce emission carbon footprint relative complete product life cycle
A relatively unknown effective way reduce emission carbon footprint reusing product
Often relative carbon footprint manufacturing unknown
A scientific methodology developed calculate much emission reduced buying used second hand hardware versus new hardware durability greener network calculator
There many way measuring positive environmental economic social impact data
These include A charge item reflects environmental cost manufacture disposal
This make environmental benefit using one reusable item instead many disposable one financial incentive
Such charge introduced country
differs reuse break item raw material used make new item opposed reusing intact item
As extra processing requires energy rule thumb reuse environmentally preferable recycling though recycling significant part play often make use item broken worn otherwise unsuitable reuse
However transport emission significant portion environmental impact reuse recycling case recycling prudent course reuse require long transport distance
A complex may required product design phase determine efficacy reuse recycling neither produce accordingly
Besides physical resource often reused notably software drive computer also explains use every modern device
And proposed way improve education assembling great library shareable reused
Software reuse grew standard library
It main principle today
Instead constantly reinventing software wheel like others building vast collection reusable software object
Reuse information tremendous organization whose translated many language
system store text already translated dozen language retrieval reuse
Reuse older software popular among
Most time used run older software platform
Sometimes older operating system reused computing role demand lot computing power
However widespread availability secondhand computer extreme low price largely supplanted immediate opportunity using DOS repurposing application especially since something like found XP computer

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Any user trying answer question try nail one aspect programming overcome naive understanding simply idiosyncratic education
So I placing subject array topic outlining programming software activity I interested focus programming skill code reuse integration topic
This topic may certainly begin software programming language difference functional programming
However I wish focus My programming education come I readily find internet book
Earlier year I enrolled class fundamental Coursera professor Daniel Grossman attempt prepare student programming language
Reuse mentioned property function object
Since I started learning Ruby php I put together better understanding integration cobbled patchwork
Published material mostly idiosyncratic mix
I even participated discussion pedagogical problem While answer reflects appreciation OP concern yet imagination ca help envying student draw ease previous project I read book participated class heard discussion attempt survey reuse integration paradigm totality
Where computer science education find comprehensive coverage
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
I think confusing computer science software engineering
Computer science concerned theory algorithm data structure proof
Software engineering discipline study software architecture construction
A computer science degree program may software engineering course necessarily part computer science per se
What described reuse integration mostly embodied practical way using concept Modularity take number form
In language actually module many others concept modularity take form individual file namespaces similar organizational mechanism
class form modularity simple function
To achieve reusability ease integration various system software must generic enough applicable wide variety programmer scenario
This achieved loose coupling
allow collection used arbitrary object
In short reuse integration achieved understanding fundamental programming principle concept applied develop software easily reused integrated

Investment facility increasing recently due technology rapid rate obsolescence concern improper method opportunity manufacturer influence secondary market used reused product
The higher metal price also recycling taking place
The controversy around method stem lack agreement preferred outcome
World market lower disposable income consider repair reuse valuable enough justify disposal
Debate certification standard may leading better definition though civil law contract governing expected process still vital contracted process poorly defined
The disposal occurring processing reuse repair equipment recovery metal may unethical illegal many kind transported overseas developing country processing
It transported repaired recycled processing le valuable becomes
Another point view net environmental cost must compared include mining refining extraction waste pollution cost new product manufactured replace secondary product routinely destroyed wealthier nation economically repaired older obsolete product
As example negative impact pollution groundwater become serious area surrounding China landfill water must shipped mile km away
However mining new metal even broader impact groundwater
Either thorough processing domestic processing overseas repair help environment avoiding pollution
Such theoretically sustainable alternative disposing landfill
In addition allows reclamation potential like requires le mined lessens potential money flow militia exploitative actor profit mining
Supporters one form required legislation argue save taxpayer money financial responsibility would shifted taxpayer manufacturer
Advocates simple legislation landfill ban argue involving manufacturer reduce cost consumer reuse value lost resulting cost passed consumer new product particularly affecting market hardly afford new product
It theorized manufacturer take part would motivated use fewer material production process create longer lasting product implement safer efficient recycling system
This theory sharply disputed never demonstrated
The critic vocal advocate
According raise product waste management cost consumer limit innovation part company
They also believe facility could unintentionally cause great harm environment
Critics claim occupy significant portion total waste
According European study waste electronic
Another opposition many problem posed disassembly process costly dangerous heavy metal electronic product composed little original cost material retrieved
A final problem people find common regard disposal electronic product
As program legislated creating winner loser among different location process may difficult distinguish criticism practice criticism specific legislated mean proposed enhance
A hefty criticism often lobbed reuse based recyclers people think recycling electronic waste reality actually exported developing country like China India Nigeria
For instance free recycling drive recyclers may staying true word selling overseas part broker
Studies indicate ton tonne sent overseas approximately million ton million tonne per year go landfill
Although possible circumstance best way upcycle
On hand electronic product question generally manufactured repaired warranty nation recyclers depict primitive
believe incentive export market lead better result domestic shredding
There continued debate increased regulation practice
In European Union debate regarding export resulted significant amendment WEEE directive January view significantly diminishing export WEEE untreated
During debate Strasburg MEPs stated million tonne WEEE generated collected recycling remainder exported sent landfill
The Amendment voted unanimous representative removed repair refurbishmet aspect directive placed emphasis upon recycling recovery precious metal base metal
The change went placing burden upon registered exporter prove used equipment leaving Europe fit purpose
Currently piece government legislation number grassroots effort contributed growth process emphasize decreased export increased reuse rate
The passed California
It requires consumer pay extra fee certain type electronics collected money redistributed recycling company qualified properly recycle product
It state legislates kind consumer fee state effort focus producer responsibility law waste disposal ban
No study shown per caput recovery greater one type legislated program
California versus ordinary waste disposal ban
Massachusetts though recovery greatly increased state use either method
As September Dell developed nation first completely free recycling program furthering responsibility manufacturer taking
Manufacturers retailer Best Buy Sony Samsung also set recycling program
This program accept television expensive used electronic item unpopular market must deal television valuable computer cherry picked
Another step taken recyclers pledge true stewardship sponsored Computer TakeBack Campaign
It signed numerous recyclers promising recycle responsibly
Grassroots effort also played big part issue community organization formed help responsibly recycle
Other grassroots campaign Basel Computer TakeBack Campaign Grassroots Recycling Network Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition
No study shown difference recycling method Pledge data available demonstrate difference management Pledge company though assumed risk making false claim prevent Pledge company wrongly describing process

In section present study conducted determine acceptability DSV member relatively population
Clearly general study necessary determine acceptability DSV public election
However limited study provides insight reaction DSV likely encountered voter population
One hundred Washington University student surveyed gauge attitude towards voting collect preference data use simulation
Survey form distributed period Summer semester physic chemistry class College Arts Sciences MBA class John Olin School Business
In class survey administrator collected survey student completed minute distributed
The survey instrument reproduced Appendix A
A total business student science student completed survey
The business student mostly graduate student often professional experience
The science student mostly undergraduate majoring science engineering planning attend medical school
The first question asked whether respondent attended school full time Spring semester
All respondent attended school full time Spring semester classified student
The remainder classified student
The distribution student follows Overall significant difference response student response business science student
Questions collected preference data use DSV simulation
These simulation discussed next section
Question asked respondent whether voted student government election school year
Only responded affirmatively
As following table illustrates student government voter science student
This may attributable fact Washington University undergraduate likely vote student government election graduate student science student undergraduate
Question asked respondent whether registered vote United States
As following table illustrates business student likely registered science student possibly due fact business student generally older science student
Question asked respondent rate five potential US Presidential candidate scale
These ranking subsequently used simulation described next section
In addition question provided context remaining question
Questions introduced follows Question described following scenario On scale indicated extreme dissatisfaction indicated extreme satisfaction mean response standard deviation
Question described scenario identical one described question exception choice end winning
On scale indicated extreme dissatisfaction indicated extreme satisfaction mean response
The result question indicate overall respondent slightly dissatisfied way computer cast vote
The fact dissatisfaction expressed response question choice response question choice suggests respondent difficulty evaluating voting procedure separately election outcome
Further analysis reveals respondent indicated level satisfaction response question indicated satisfaction response question indicated satisfaction response question
It clear respondent would satisfied performance computer question question
It likely gave type response fully understand question
However removing respondent analysis question significantly impact result
Question asked How certain would want first choice going win supported computer voting second choice
Overall respondent supported computer voting second choice condition
The result question showed significant difference group business science student science student reluctant let computer decide vote second choice
Note last response option question essentially bandwagon option discussed Chapter
Question asked How easy difficult find understand voting
On scale indicated extremely difficult indicated extremely easy mean response
Question asked voter compare fairness DSV plurality voting
This question designed get reaction definition fairness given
On scale indicated DSV much fair indicated DSV much le fair mean response Business student likely science student find DSV fair plurality
Questions asked respondent would feel DSV adopted US Presidential election student government election tallying university survey respectively
Respondents strongest feeling Presidential election expressing indifference response use DSV student government election survey
On scale indicated extreme dissatisfaction indicated extreme satisfaction mean three question
Overall respondent indicated le satisfaction prospect using DSV Presidential election student government election indicated le satisfaction prospect using DSV Presidential election survey
It surprising respondent stronger opinion Presidential election student government election especially considering majority student report voting student government election past year
It somewhat surprising student slightly le satisfied prospect using DSV survey student government election
However likely due fact indifference student government election survey
Overall student slightly dissatisfied prospect using DSV context
This indicates voter education would essential population likely accept DSV indeed extensive voter education necessary adopt new type voting system
However also indicates population completely set using DSV
At end survey respondent asked In opinion advantage voting
In opinion disadvantage voting
Only respondent answered one question difficult tell respondent meant wrote
However able group response category according common theme many also come informal conversation voting
The following theme mentioned least three time survey respondent
Some respondent mentioned one theme response
Note respondent specifically listed advantage similar phrase response question thus include response theme
With exception respondent convinced advantage DSV respondent listed advantage correct observation
While fairly low number respondent recognized advantage DSV encouraging respondent able recognize advantage given limited information DSV
One frequently mentioned disadvantage DSV indeed one significant problem DSV type DSV described survey given set ballot always produce outcome
This problem discussed detail later chapter
Although problem may critical theoretical standpoint shall explain later important realize may viewed voter major problem
This problem may serve limit application DSV acceptable unless resolved explained satisfaction voter
Many disadvantage mentioned survey respondent attributed respondent limited understanding DSV
For example respondent complained DSV might force voter vote second choice even second choice wanted support first choice
However DSV require voter support one choice even support one choice
Voters wish vote sincerely preferred candidate may give zero rating candidate
This made clear survey form
Some respondent seem equate democracy simple majority rule voting
This misunderstanding came many time informal discussion acquaintance well
Our observation indicate many people believe democracy requires simple majority rule voting plurality rule thing majority rule
They believe anything majority plurality rule voting would undemocratic unconstitutional
They often surprised learn plurality rule voting may produce outcome support majority democratic country use plurality rule voting elect representative
They also surprised learn voting system may enacted without change United States Constitution constitution individual state
Clearly DSV alternative voting system adopted prospective electorate would generally educated voting system
Some respondent complained DSV susceptible manipulation
One respondent apparently somewhat familiar voting theory cited Arrow theorem
However respondent seem realize voting system currently used much susceptible manipulation DSV
Some respondent viewed fact DSV tallied computer disadvantage
These respondent stated concerned possibility computer error trust computer make decision behalf
These respondent may aware computer used tally ballot majority US election
While complicated nature DSV increase likelihood error might introduced vote tallying program DSV suffer significantly computer error traditional voting method
Public education may help alleviate fear

Published September Last revised May Accessibility resource inhibited security mechanism
If security mechanism hinder usability accessibility resource user may opt turn mechanism
Where possible security mechanism transparent user system introduce minimal obstruction
Security mechanism user friendly facilitate use understanding software application
According Saltzer Schroeder Saltzer Basic Principles Information Protection page Psychological acceptability It essential human interface designed ease use user routinely automatically apply protection mechanism correctly
Also extent user mental image protection goal match mechanism must use mistake minimized
If must translate image protection need radically different specification language make error
According Bishop Bishop Chapter Design Principles Principle Psychological Acceptability page This principle recognizes human element computer security
Definition
The principle psychological acceptability state security mechanism make resource difficult access security mechanism present
Configuring executing program easy intuitive possible output clear direct useful
If software complicated configure system administrator may unintentionally set software manner
Similarly user program must easy use output understandable message
If password rejected password changing program state rejected rather giving cryptic error message
If configuration file incorrect parameter error message describe proper parameter
On hand security requires message impart unnecessary information
In practice principle interpreted mean security mechanism may add extra burden burden must minimal reasonable
The ssh program allows user set public key mechanism enciphering communication system
The installation configuration mechanism UNIX version allow one arrange public key stored locally without password protection
In case one need supply password connect remote system still obtains enciphered connection
This mechanism satisfies principle psychological acceptability
When user supply wrong password login system reject attempt message stating login failed
If say password incorrect user would know account name legitimate
If user
really unauthorized attacker know account try guess password
A mainframe system allows user place password file
Accessing file requires program supply password
Although mechanism violates principle stated considered sufficiently minimal acceptable
On interactive system pattern file access frequent transient requirement would great burden acceptable

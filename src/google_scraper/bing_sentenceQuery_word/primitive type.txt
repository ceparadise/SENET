In either following In programming language basic data type
In addition many language also provide set composite data type
Opinions vary whether type composite considered primitive
Depending language implementation primitive data type may may correspondence object computer memory
However one usually expects operation basic primitive data type fastest language construct
Integer addition example performed single machine instruction offer specific instruction process sequence character single instruction
In particular standard mention int object natural size suggested architecture execution environment
This mean likely bit long architecture
Basic primitive type almost always
Most language allow behavior capability primitive either basic data type modified program
Exceptions include permit data type extended within program adding operation performed even redefining operation
The actual range primitive data type available dependent upon specific programming language used
For example composite data type whereas modern dialect assimilated primitive data type basic
Classic basic primitive type may include More sophisticated type include An data type represents
Integers may either signed allowing negative value unsigned
Common range Literals integer written regular numeral consisting sequence digit negation indicated value
However programming language disallow use comma
Examples integer literal There several alternate method writing integer literal many programming language A type typically denoted bool boolean typically either true false
Although one bit necessary accommodate value set true false programming language typically implement boolean type one byte
Many language
implement booleans adhering concept distinct logical type
Languages though may implicitly convert booleans time give extended semantics booleans boolean expression achieve backwards compatibility earlier version language
For example former standard dedicated boolean type
Instead numeric value zero interpreted false value interpreted true
add distinct boolean type included support type true false reserved word
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally format equivalent typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
Many language often called float type
Literals floating point number include decimal point typically use denote scientific notation
Examples literal Some language also type comprising two number real part imaginary part
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally form typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
number also tend limited range value programmer must careful avoid overflow intermediate calculation well final result
A type typically called char may contain single specialized code
In defined smallest addressable unit memory
On system Several standard require size
Some language two character type example type character type character
The term character type normally used even type whose value precisely represent example code unit
Characters may combined
The string data include number numerical symbol treated text
Strings implemented various way depending programming language
The simplest way implement string create array character followed delimiting character used signal end string usually
These referred usually found language low amount
While easy implement null terminated string criticized causing
Most scripting language many dialect separate character type string length one normally used represent single character
Some language capability use string usually measure additionally provide class string handling respectively standard library
There also difference whether string mutable language
Mutable string may altered creation whereas immutable string maintain constant size content
In latter way alter string create new one
There advantage disadvantage approach although immutable string much le flexible simpler completely
Some example language use mutable string include whereas language include
A language provide different type mutable immutable string
Literals character string usually surrounded sometimes single quote used character double quote used string
Examples character literal C syntax Examples string literal C syntax Each numeric data type maximum minimum value known
Attempting store number outside range may lead error incorrect calculation due depending language used
The range variable based number byte used save value integer data type usually able store value number contribute value
For data type
value range complicated vary depending method used store
There also type use entire byte
boolean requires single represents value although practice byte often used remaining bit redundant
Some programming language also allow opposite direction programmer defines range precision needed solve given problem compiler chooses appropriate integer type automatically

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
My understanding primitive datatype It datatype provided language implicitly Others user defined class So different language different set datatypes considered primitive particular language
Is right
And difference basic datatype datatype
Wikipedia say primitive datatype either two
It kind depends language
For example language like C number scalar type etc
These primitive sense decomposed simpler component
From basic type define new type pointer type array type struct type union type etc
Then language like Lisp everything either
Again definition atom primitive sense decomposed something simpler
As far I concerned term primitive basic pretty much interchangeable
If want get pedantic though distinguish type explicitly provided language definition type derived type still primitive basic decomposed simpler element
C facility allows create new type name existing type
Ada allows create new scalar type constraint
For example derive Latitude type floating type constraint ca take value outside range
It still primitive basic type broken simpler component since considered type
Again concept little fuzzy really depends context
For example notion type meaningless typeless language like BLISS
From perspective In Java clear distinction primitive type
A variable primitive type directly contains value type word
A variable type contain value directly instead similar pointer object
It possible Java create value type
Java eight primitive type
Anything else type
A primitive basic data type built data type
It represent one single value
All primitive data type necessity compiler know data type primitive
In language compiler knowledge certain type built thing able treat special way
Examples would Variant Delphi Visual Basic Boo equivalent Duck base object class OO language
Why string type considered primitive type Java
Because Java Language Specification clearly specifies word primitive mean context Java Java conform specification whereas Language Specification defines primitive mean context string conforms specification
There really nothing
The specification respective language defines certain word mean something either fit description
For example C Language Specification defines meaning word function something clearly word function usually mean way word used inside C community
A data type mean value stored memory value method internal structure
A primitive operated external operation
In Java primitive number int long etc
char
If value structure I thinking strut primitive
If method object class primitive
I came across information felt would aid answer
So want share Wikipedia say I would like say way A basic datatype datatype broken string type made char char datatype In Programming language
So basic datatype Primitives fundamental data type provided language
Example C language int float char data type
It provided fundamental part language
Non primitive user defined variable object
For example define object store data use struct C define variable
These primitive define first order used
Examples Employee Student I think primitive variable came originally language variable like String declare using New keyword
That make object String would primitive
Answer comment It probably implementation variable
If part language core primitive
If
Example String
This core variable declared using New keyword
So primitive
For better understanding concept primitive type datatypes answer lack concept
If understand concept getting selected come know primitive datatypes compiler know
Thank interest question

By used distinguishing primitive value object
We know instance subtyping provided object type primitive type
In chapter focus bit difference two kind value
We look special type called wrapper class provide bridge primitive value object
We also study difference way two kind value stored memory implication difference assignment statement
This lead u concept garbage collection important feature Java
Object value variable however stored differently
Consider Integer I new Integer Double D new Double As value variable allocated memory
However assignment copy variable block content value block instead address
All Java address word long variable allocated block regardless type
Thus Double variable D Integer variable I size case double variable integer variable saw
All object however size
When new object created composite memory block consisting series consecutive block one instance variable object created
Thus assuming Integer single int instance variable block consisting single integer variable created
Similarly Double instance block consisting single double instance variable created
The size two object different difference size instance variable
However case object block consists single variable
Now consider following class public class APoint implement Point int x public APoint int initX int initY x initX initY public void setX int newVal x newVal The figure show following assignment instance class processed Point P new APoint An instance class memory block consisting two consecutive int block shown figure
Now consider following subclass APoint called ABoundedPoint declares two APoint instance variable defining rectangular area defining bound point public class ABoundedPoint extends APoint APoint upperLeftCorner lowerRightCorner public ABoundedPoint int initX int initY Point initUpperLeftCorner Point initLowerRightCorner super initX initY upperLeftCorner initUpperLeftCorner lowerRightCorner initLowerRightCorner Recall instance instance variable defined class also defined superclass class
Therefore instance ABoundedPoint memory block consisting memory block four variable two int variable size word inherited APoint two object variable also size word defined ABoundedPoint

In simply classification data tell programmer intends use data
Most programming language support various type data example
A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory
The type system us data type information check access manipulate data
Most data type statistic comparable type computer programming vice versa shown following table identified five definition type literature
Types including behavior align closely model whereas model would tend include code called
The five type The definition term representation often done imperative language definition term value space behaviour used language
typically type basic language implementation
All data computer based digital electronics represented alternative lowest level
The smallest addressable unit data usually group bit called usually bit
The unit processed instruction called typically bit
Most instruction interpret word word represent unsigned integer value signed integer value
Because machine language machine need distinguish unsigned signed data type part
There specific set arithmetic instruction use different interpretation bit word number
Machine data type need made available allowing control hardware
The instance supply integer type various width
If corresponding native type exist target platform compiler break code using type exist
For instance integer requested bit platform compiler tacitly treat array two bit integer
Several language allow convenient manipulation machine data
In higher level programming machine data type often hidden implementation detail would render code le portable exposed
For instance generic type might supplied instead integer specific
The represents value
Although two value possible rarely implemented single binary digit efficiency reason
Many programming language explicit Boolean type instead interpreting instance false value true
Boolean data simply refers logical structure language interpreted machine language
In case Boolean refers logic False
True always non zero especially one known Boolean
Such derived one primitive type
This done number way
The way combined called
Composing primitive type compound type generally result new type
different type
Many others possible tend variation compound
The distinct value compared assigned necessarily particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four suit deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Some implementation allow programmer assign integer value enumeration value even treat integer
Such Character string type store sequence character character set
Since character set include possible numeric string
However many language treat belonging different type numeric value
Character string type different subtypes according required character width
The original wide ASCII found limited superseded set encode wide variety alphabet symbol
Strings may either fixed size even programming language
They may also subtyped maximum size
Note string primitive language instance C may composed array character
Types based derived basic type explained
In language C type derived type
The main derived type data type whose value refers directly point another value stored elsewhere using
It primitive kind
In everyday term page number book could considered piece data refers another one
Pointers often stored format similar integer however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To ameliorate potential problem pointer considered separate type type data point even underlying representation
Any type specify implementation
For instance abstract type implemented array contiguous block memory containing multiple value set memory block linked
Abstract type handled code know care underlying type contained
Programming agnostic concrete data type called
Arrays record also contain underlying type considered concrete specify content element laid memory
Examples include For convenience language may supply real world data type instance even language allows built primitive type
A associate type computed value
By examining flow value type system attempt prove occur
The type system question determines constitutes type error type system generally seek guarantee operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense
A may use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler data type example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Type system may variously forth

A primitive data type either data type built programming language one could characterized basic structure building sophisticated data type
Programmers often immediately familiar primitive data type used coding involve sophisticated data set effective representation
Examples primitive data type include integer floating point number individual character text
Each primitive data type example something require large amount data representation
Characters simply correspond single reference point ASCII chart
Integers number need complex identifier exponent decimal point
Boolean value require binary choice two possible value
Other data type may may primitive depending design programming language system
One common example string
A string variable collection character put together single dynamic variable
Programming language work string amend necessary
In case string built program particular kind support could called primitive data type
However share basic design element primitive data type discussed
Other specific explanation primitive data type include idea primitive data type broken simpler data type
Others explain primitive data type contrasting class sophisticated class created user whereas primitive data type already created platform interface programmer developer using
These explanation help explain one specific type variable may considered primitive data type one language another
Other expert may contrast primitive data type derived data type created using collection primitive data type
As result broken basic element primitive data type

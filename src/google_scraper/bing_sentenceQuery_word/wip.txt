WIP without problem however
This article take look WIP security provides brief summary user need know creating using wireless network
Wireless Internet Technology great mobile user previosuly mentioned possible anyone pick information transmitted wireless network therefore Wireless Internet Protocol came allow secure wireless connection
WIP help preventing unauthorized people accessing someone else network resource like shared file peripheral etc
By preventing unauthorized access one network computer user stop outsider consuming Internet bandwidth
Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP first security algorithm used Wireless Internet Protocol
However criticized due weak encryption authentication small key size
To solve problem introduced Protected Access protocol WPA Protected Access offer better security wireless network
use multiple pas key instead single key network user
Moreover WPA use key combination making difficult anyone guess key
WEP still widely used home cafe insufficient business environment rapid transmission data help eavesdropper attacker discover encryption key easily

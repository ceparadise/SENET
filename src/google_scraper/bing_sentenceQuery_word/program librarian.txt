In collection used often
These may include configuration data documentation help data message template specification
In referred
A also collection implementation behavior written term language interface behavior invoked
For instance people want write higher level program use library make instead implementing system call
In addition behavior provided reuse multiple independent program
A program invokes behavior via mechanism language
For example simple C behavior library invoked using C normal
What distinguishes call library function versus another function program way code organized system
Library code organized way used multiple program connection code part program organized used within one program
This distinction gain hierarchical notion program grows large program
In case may internal library reused independent large program
The distinguishing feature library organized purpose reused independent program user need know interface internal detail library
The value library lie reuse behavior
When program invokes library gain behavior implemented inside library without implement behavior
Libraries encourage sharing code fashion ease distribution code
The behavior implemented library connected invoking program different
If code library accessed build invoking program library called
An alternative build executable invoking program distribute independently library implementation
The library behavior connected executable invoked executed either part process starting execution middle execution
In case library called loaded
A dynamic library loaded linked preparing program execution
Alternatively middle execution application may explicitly request module
Most although programmer also create custom library
Most modern provide library implement majority system service
Such library service modern application requires
As code used modern application provided system library
The earliest programming concept analogous library intended separate definition program
brought COMPOOL Communication Pool concept popular attention although adopted idea software
Following computer science principle Comm Pool purpose permit sharing System Data among many program providing centralized data description
also included primitive capability library system described inadequate library facility retrospect
Another major contributor modern library concept came form innovation
FORTRAN subprogram compiled independently compiler lacked
So prior introduction module FORTRAN subprogram impossible
Finally historian concept remember influential
Simula first language nearly identical modern concept used
The concept Simula also progenitor
Even developed originally Simula class could included library file added compile time
Libraries important program process resolve reference known library module
The linking process usually automatically done program search set library module given order
Usually considered error link target found multiple time given set library
Linking may done executable file created whenever program used
The reference resolved may address jump routine call
They may main program one module depending upon another
They resolved fixed relocatable address common base allocating runtime memory module referenced
Some programming language may use feature called whereby linker aware integrated compiler linker know external reference used code library never actually even though internally referenced discarded compiled application
For example program us integer arithmetic arithmetic operation exclude library routine
This feature lead smaller application file size reduced memory usage
Some reference program library module stored relative symbolic form resolved code library assigned final static address
process adjusting reference done either linker
In general relocation done individual library address memory may vary depending program using library combined
avoids reference absolute address therefore require relocation
When linking performed creation executable another object file known
In case linking usually done may also done
A also known one intended statically linked
Originally static library existed
Static linking must performed module recompiled
All module required program sometimes statically linked copied executable file
This process resulting file known program
A static build may need used desired
A file intended shared shared object file
Modules used program loaded individual shared object memory rather copied linker creates single monolithic executable file program
Shared library statically linked meaning reference library module resolved module allocated memory executable file created
But often linking shared library postponed loaded
Most modern shared library file format executable file
This offer two main advantage first requires making one loader rather two single loader considered well worth added complexity
Secondly allows executables also used shared library
Typical combined executable shared library format Unix Windows
In older environment stack based data local allowed shared library code significant restriction placed shared library code
Library code may shared memory multiple well disk
If virtual memory used process would execute physical page RAM mapped different address space process
This advantage
For instance system application often hundred kilobyte size loaded quickly majority code located library already loaded purpose operating system
Programs accomplish RAM sharing using lead complex flexible architecture using common virtual address Windows
These system make sure various trick like address space reserving slot shared library code great probability shared
A third alternative used successor
This allows code place significant restriction code placed shared
In case different version shared library cause problem especially library different version file name different application installed system require specific version
Such scenario known named Windows
Most modern operating system method eliminate situation use application specific private library
Dynamic linking linking performed program loaded executed rather executable file created
A dynamically linked library DLL dynamic shared object DSO system library intended dynamic linking
Only minimum amount work done executable file created record library routine program need index name number routine library
The majority work linking done time application loaded load time execution run time
Usually necessary linking program called dynamic linker linking loader actually part underlying
However possible exceedingly difficult write program us dynamic linking includes dynamic linker even operating system provides support dynamic linking
Programmers originally developed dynamic linking operating system starting MTS built late
Since shared library system change often system compute likely load address shared library system needed store information library executables
If every shared library loaded undergone process load predetermined address speed process dynamic linking
This optimization known macOS Linux
Disadvantages technique include time required precompute address every time shared library change inability use requirement sufficient virtual address space use problem alleviated adoption architecture least time
Loaders shared library vary widely functionality
Some depend executable storing explicit path library
Any change library naming layout file system cause system fail
More commonly name library path stored executable operating system supplying method find library based algorithm
If shared library executable depends deleted moved renamed incompatible version library copied place earlier search executable would fail load
This called existing many platform
The infamous Windows variant commonly known
This problem occur version library uniquely identified program reference library full unique identifier
The DLL hell problem earlier Windows version arose using name library guaranteed unique resolve dynamic link program
To avoid DLL hell later version Windows rely largely option program install private partial retreat use shared mechanism prevent replacement shared system DLLs earlier version
check determine proper place load DLLs implement DLLs check directory defined order
First Windows check directory loaded program directory set calling function System Windows directory current working directory finally directory specified PATH
Applications written framework since also check primary store shared dll file remove issue
used flexible system collecting list library number known location similar PATH concept system first start
Moving library around cause problem although user incur time cost first starting system
Most system search path specifying file system look dynamic library
Some system specify default path others dynamic loader
Some format specify additional directory search library particular program
This usually overridden although disabled setgid program user ca force program run arbitrary code root permission
Developers library encouraged place dynamic library place default search path
On downside make installation new library problematic known location quickly become home increasing number library file making management complex
Dynamic loading subset dynamic linking involves dynamically linked library loading unloading request
Such request may made implicitly explicitly run time
Implicit request made compile time linker add library reference include file path simply file name
Explicit request made application make direct call operating system API run time
Most operating system support dynamically linked library also support dynamically loading library via linker
For instance us API function based system including UNIX system use
Some development system automate process
Although originally pioneered dynamic linking reach used consumer late
It generally available form operating system early
During period OOP becoming significant part programming landscape
OOP runtime binding requires additional information traditional library supply
In addition name entry point code located within also require list object depend
This one OOP main advantage inheritance mean part complete definition method may different place
This simply listing one library requires service another true OOP system library may known vary system system
At time many developer worked idea program display running desktop computer would use service data storage processing
For instance program computer would send message minicomputer return small sample huge dataset display
RPC already handled task standard RPC system
Soon majority minicomputer mainframe vendor instigated project combine two producing OOP library format could used anywhere
Such system known supported remote access
Microsoft COM example system local use DCOM modified version support remote access
For time object library held status next big thing programming world
There number effort create system would run across platform company competed try get developer locked system
Examples include DOE PDO Microsoft number system
After inevitable cooling marketing hype object library continue used programming distributed information system
rough OOP equivalent older type code library
They contain describe characteristic define action involve object
Class library used create object characteristic set specific value
In OOP language like distinction clear class often contained library file like Java instantiated object residing memory although potentially able made separate file
In others like class library merely starting point includes entire state environment class instantiated object
Another solution library issue come using completely separate executables often lightweight form calling using RPC network another computer
This approach maximizes operating system code needed support library code used provide application support security every program
Additionally system require library exist machine forward request network
However approach mean every library call requires considerable amount overhead
RPC call much expensive calling shared library already loaded machine
This approach commonly used make heavy use remote call notably system
Code generation library generate transform
They used data access framework testing generate dynamic proxy object
They also used intercept field access
The system store file directory
The filename always start end suffix static library shared object dynamically linked library
Some system might multiple name dynamically linked library name name remaining name name might include major version library full version number example system would filename second major interface revision dynamically linked library
The file sometimes found library directory archive usable system
The system inherits static library convention library stored file use dynamically linked library suffix instead
Most library macOS however consist framework placed inside special directory called wrap library required file metadata
For example framework called would implemented bundle called either dynamically linked library file symlink dynamically linked library file
usually suffix although file name extension may identify dynamically linked library
library
The interface revision either encoded file name abstracted away using interface
Depending compiled file either static library representation dynamically linkable library needed compilation known
Unlike world us different file extension linking file one must first know regular static library import library
In latter case file must present run time

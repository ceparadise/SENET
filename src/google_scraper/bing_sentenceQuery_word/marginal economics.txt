Designing electronic marketplace focus offered jointly MIT economics computer science department
This area commercially say David Autor Ford Professor Economics associate head Department Economics
Hiring economist become really prominent tech company filling Because company need analyst decide objective maximize information choice offer rule set company really looking skill set say
UBER Airbnb Amazon familiar marketplace need computer scientist cum economist designer online world like EveOnline join multiple marketplace entire economy
I also note increasing number marketplace need designed people create entirely new challenge
Sounds good
I would
At downmarket state school course
As news embedded When provide degree online I impressed
If enroll MIT gross million perhaps training new economist change actually understand math
Hopefully grasp implication sensitivity initial condition I digress
Of course education behemoth signalling artificial scarcity
It common soup nazi longer line thus suffering greater abuse secure tyrant inside attractive expensive product
It spiral upward price
I wait education bubble burst
Compulsory education form slavery Orwellian indoctrination followed lifetime debt serve interest institution called higher education
Bring
Back day studied like math
Up recently wanted go data science usually teach lot I know I
My actual master political economy
I sure I would chosen data science master instead existed time lot fun teach data science tool applied research rather simply learning tool tool sake
On hand lot uncertainty stress trying teach stuff I continue formal education
Can point source learning material found particularly useful
What would avoid time
All paper asset market going fully automated otherwise end paying monopoly fee high frequency trader
A degree cor everything nobody locked little channel MIT grad properly rewarded well associated MIT
everybody
Double cuckold Econ CS
Maybe skeptic explain learned NumPy R integrated casework unnecessary

I took week data science mooc canceling family ski trip
It taste interested even R hard
You need learn statistic method understand R otherwise pointless
I think
I better statistic class sooner
In precomputer day hard something like
The family ski trip worth R class online anytime
I really see point MOOCs data science thing honest
You need good background stats math truely useful
The MOOCs teach tool maybe bit theory comparable year degree
I believe online MS series class
Mine survey lecture statistic
Not enough perhaps late old brain
Ah
Yeah well I really see point either learn use lose
Unless pressing need work innate passion stats I see value spending much energy
This undergraduate degree
It joint degree new major
Other college joint degree program typically combine
Speaking MIT I really miss Click Clack Tappet Brothers
Was going say thing MBA MIS analytics course equivalent
A number graduate business school course way taught economist
A number business school MIS business analytics department comp sci stats department create similar interdisciplinary program
Good econ department waking
The major indeed seem good idea although computer science major simply take bunch econ class either minor MIT call HASS concentration econ major could simply take bunch computer science class
This sentence though puzzle In poll introductory economics course student required take faculty found whopping interested joint major What student required take
The poll
Intro econ
Neither make sense
Or maybe requirement applies econ major pretty much go without saying
This make difference one interpretation sentence large percentage student take intro econ interested new major
But I dubious historically student pretty much interested economics taking way fulfilling HASS requirement
Econ MIT student version rock jock physic poet class college used student fulfill science distribution requirement
Maybe new econ econ slow change
How could anyone like guy The transcript interview become pleasing voice interview
I wonder whether future program simply saying Siri Take numeric data column one assign value run regression using value column
Check heteroskedacity multicollinearity
If Then Maybe teaching today R also abstract feature statistic econ day day grind stuff automated
How many still remember Fortran really today use logic flow chart set program
Voice code translator exist Thanks
You always learn others
What flow chart
This obvious anyone watched original Star Trek series thier formative year
Spock
Beam
I lost somewhere internet
I still use Fortran professionally I also still tend think computer machine performs arithmetic purpose approximating solution partial differential equation
Sometimes I darkly suspect I die one field science left data science
All others abandoned
No one know anything except extract curve fit serve well enough get
I minor econ go EECS Major easy way satisfy humanity requirement without write much
If version could get would heaven
Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis ran Valve economy Sorry Bud I think academia far long
We already degree people understand marketplace called Marketing
It cryptic I know
They know use computer cost tradeoff
And thousand thousand thousand already
Right
Today
I know hyping field forgiven come
This seems much useful MIT eventually pitch precursor product management role Sillicon Valley
Most company require CS baseline make sure PMs interface well engineering team economics background providing good grounding empirical analysis strategy required make good business decision
If I I love something like instead straight
Increasingly specialized undergraduate degree thought bad thing
There already plenty way student show multidisciplinary skill double major minor individual course
Most student go computer science already programming experience get university simply major economics
The brochure mention von Neumann Herbert Simon role model offspring mixing gene
Perhaps
But story Bernard Shaw refused mix gene beautiful dancer He worried gene dominant brain beauty

Much Daskalakis work concentrate application computer science technique game theory discipline attempt get quantitative handle human strategic reasoning
Photo Bryce Vickmark Email Phone MIT News Office image download Media downloaded desktop version website
Daedalus Crete according Greek myth designed labyrinth trapped Minotaur one oldest symbol human ingenuity credited invention saw ax glue ship sail among thing
Constantinos Daskalakis recently tenured associate professor computer science engineering MIT come Cretan family fanciful suggest ingenuity work theoretical computer science owes anything example Daedalus problem explores undoubtedly labyrinthine
Much Daskalakis work concentrate application computer science technique game theory discipline attempt get quantitative handle human strategic reasoning
Game theory model human interaction series move clearly defined game move represents instance particular strategy may elicit different response player leading different reward
Even simple game handful player take vastly twist turn largest physical labyrinth
Daskalakis parent Crete met Athens come college father study mathematics mother study Ancient Greek literature philosophy
Until came graduate school Daskalakis lived greater Athens area like country population
When ask question Where Greece different meaning ask States Daskalakis say
In States mean grew
In Greece mean family originated Both Daskalakis parent teacher child showed interest aptitude discipline
In junior high however competed math Olympiad finished second country
Though literature remains important MIT feature complete text poem great Greek modernist poet Constantine Cavafy marked student exceptional mathematical promise
In Greece every high school senior opts take one three set standardized test determines university placement
Daskalakis score technical exam fifth highest country earning spot prestigious National Technical University Athens
He enrolled electrical engineering computer science curriculum first half spent canvassing huge range topic physic individual electrical component esoteric question theoretical computer science
Sampling big spectrum satiated desire applied domain Daskalakis say
I understood I could write complicated program decided OK I know write program
Let Daskalakis applied accepted graduate program several university fifth year came United States visit
At University California Berkeley captivated computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou recipient Association Computing Machinery major award theoretical computer science
Papadimitriou personality celebrated bestselling comic book He inspiring person Daskalakis say founding father interaction computer science After returning Greece Daskalakis chose focus interaction undergraduate thesis
Game theory staple economics research since John Nash taught MIT subject movie A Beautiful Mind published seminal paper would ultimately win Nobel Prize economics
Every game called Nash equilibrium describes balance strategy player incentive change unilaterally
Daskalakis thesis investigated Nash equilibrium game represented highly regular network interaction
The paper accepted Annual European Symposium Algorithms
I still find elegant piece work Daskalakis say
In graduating Daskalakis moved Berkeley continue study algorithmic game theory Papadimitriou
Four year later doctoral dissertation Association Computing Machinery thesis award
In Daskalakis computing Nash equilibrium game computationally intractable
That mean simplest game computer world calculate Nash equilibrium lifetime universe
Consequently Daskalakis argues unlikely market modeled game theorist converged Nash equilibrium either
I blessed throughout career brilliant graduate student collaborator Costis Daskalakis different Papadimitriou say
I working ended thesis problem complexity Nash equilibrium two decade
In fall conversation Costis remarkably started first year graduate study Berkeley inspired give another good push ultimately led important During last year Berkeley Daskalakis got job offer MIT deferred year postdoc Microsoft Research New England
It really year step back think I want next coming MIT busy Daskalakis say
When computer scientist run intractable problem first recourse investigate tractability approximate solution
After doctoral thesis Daskalakis focused importing notion approximation computer science economics
First published several paper examining computation approximate Nash equilibrium
Some result disheartening For general game even relatively coarse approximation still intractably hard find
Other problem game theory however proven susceptible analysis computational perspective
In coming MIT Daskalakis student solved economics generalization work helped earn University Chicago Roger Myerson Nobel Prize economics
That problem structure auction multiple item even bidder adopt strategy maximize return auctioneer still extract greatest profit
Since Daskalakis group taken topic computational genetics probability theory machine learning
They also working generalize result auction design
The computer science aesthetic Given problem I looking algorithm solves instance problem Daskalakis say
The economics aesthetic Given problem I want understand structure solution different instance problem
I want able make universal statement structure Working interface economics computation balance two aesthetic
Now trying import economics aesthetic To Daskalakis add turned develop new tool field mathematics called optimal transport theory examines efficient way move object data multiple origin destination
The labyrinthine path Daskalakis started senior college continues branch unexpected way

In general people want get value resource
The go must ensure benefit certain activity outweigh cost order profitable
One tool weighing relationship examination cost benefit marginal small change production good additional unit input good
For example bakery might use marginal analysis determine potential benefit increase bread production
This tool useful helping people business decide allocate scarce resource order minimize cost maximize benefit
Now know marginal analysis evaluates relationship cost benefit let explore need conduct analysis
Let start reviewing formula net benefit production net benefit total benefit total cost To conduct marginal analysis must analyze benefit formula affected The input output change one control variable formula
Marginal analysis focus whether change control variable one
We understand aim marginal analysis determine change net benefit
So let introduce formula marginal analysis change net benefit marginal benefit marginal cost Let look right side equation
also known marginal revenue increase total benefit result change output good one unit
The equation marginal benefit MR marginal benefit TR total revenue Q control variable delta symbol triangle change unit increase total cost result change output good one unit
It represented following equation MC marginal cost TC total cost delta symbol triangle change unit Get FREE access day create account
When find value marginal benefit cost apply marginal analysis formula find change net benefit
From marginal analysis formula see marginal benefit greater marginal cost positive change net benefit
In case additional unit added
However marginal benefit higher marginal cost leading change negative change net benefit would wise add additional unit
In general net benefit increase marginal benefit greater marginal cost
And marginal analysis help determine change profitable business
Imagine faced following situation
Your company Sonio Electronics producing smartphones cost selling giving total revenue
Say produce smartphones total revenue total cost
Should company produce smartphone
The answer
But
Let go marginal analysis procedure
Your marginal benefit marginal revenue smartphone calculated using marginal benefit formula Your marginal cost phone calculated using marginal cost formula Now apply value marginal analysis formula change net benefit What found producing additional smartphone net benefit would fall
That marginal cost increased increase marginal benefit
With know refuse produce extra smartphone
important economic concept
It aid economic focusing small change addition one unit
The aim marginal analysis determine change net benefit using formula change net benefit marginal benefit marginal cost increase total benefit result change output good one unit
increase total cost result change output good one unit
If equation reveals change net benefit positive benefit producing additional unit
If change negative value change net benefit may unwise create additional unit

submitted Should I pursue economics degree computer science degree
edit thanks advice still super undecided super confused Post comment
Whatever interested
Computer Science would practical evolving technology introduced constantly
Also keep mind computer science program start paper
Other introductory Java programming mostly knee deep math homework
This course also go econ degree
I started introductory Java class HS college first CS class
Of course later alot math math really come second year
They got ta entice young one programming aspect ring instead throwing tough Math class making change major
I think bit unfair
People spend damn good money huge time commitment well
I say cognizant challenge chosen field
There elective version course reason
That let people sample material lower pressure environment
I would honestly go either point
If confused know enough either degree
Think like Do I want miserable year year
The year time working get degree
I always thought computer science interesting job
I thought boring looking much nothing typing code liking
And even good one give much order hold
Here comparison job one probably think know Computer science geology
Computer science Most time people around time workplace social behavior looked aside break period
You inside nice bad weather
Pay hopefully always good
It needed position lot position temporary
It allows work remotely case usually job
You got lot option work
You get paid hobby related profession creating apps game side example
To make higher amount money chance locked form team another
Geology You get job people around alone
You rely team
It guaranteed get good pay want
There lot specialty get involved
It traditional job also stable job
It profession part afraid politically correct workplace
You make money hobby related profession hobby get paid also get outside give exercise
So really profession give similar benefit however I think computer science give versatility want work home company etc I think geology definitely easier two find good job
Also I think computer science would enjoyable people like indoor activity geology better people active want get
I think comparing hobby good way compare two degree Computer science hobby related degree would like creating thing enjoy find useful could sell
Geology hobby would thing like gold panning selling gold geode find
Both profession lot math
So really similar profession aspect like idea working alone outdoor stuff exercising I think geology much better choice computer science
But like indoors like exercising creativity bit computer science way go
But say ca exercise computer science ca creative gold pan
There video guy youtube built machine turned rock powder could get gold easier
And video people youtube work obviously easier based work background spend time
Anyway something think
I psychology degree used get I worked business year college worked even finishing
I used geology comparison I recently got interested I like publishing I feel trapped indoors lot
So I guess I saying make happy
It even specific job
I always enjoyed outdoors I get stressed I get every relax enjoy life
It nothing actual job much control I I I get outside fun
I know many people stressed I honestly think forgotten relax outside
If outside often indoors trying please fulfill social need someone else feel lot le stress
One example I think cursing add flavor like
I find entertaining put group people meeting someone curse seems awkward politically correct think Is appropriate
You think outside curse heart content
You pretty much anything want nothing make judge
It MAYBE friend type friend ever take
Anyway kinda stuff I would thinking try decide kind job want determine degree need go
You might even need degree
It turn I I made use college accessing expensive article subscription since library paid English teacher I kept contact helped quite bit feedback
I would take time talk professor every degree program issue What kind job MOST people get result degree
If ca answer say specific ask Is realistic expect find job degree
You disappointed department dodge question
If think hard whether interested degree program
Do I need higher bachelor degree make good money degree
It okay need master important know front
Do company recruit degree college
If coming recruit year
asking make sure bullshitting
If job actually demand WILL recruiter
Even relatively small college people oil field company recruiting student
Some student undergrad still recruited
It may computer science area like California I know like computer science job pay well want stay area definitely ask
What percentage student population degree program large percent small percent compared program school offer
This question great find potential job pay well reason show much competition going future
One reason I like geology many people know think lazy curriculum even
That mean growing job market even people want get market something get easily
Compare psychology though ca done night either sheer number people going degree mean hard time getting dream job unless willing move even never really know pan
Plus people respect offering much ilk dime dozen unless UBER specialized like cognitive psychologist specializes functioning specific system brain
However problem time needed
However needed get charge hell people often pioneering field literally one else go better
However reality may never needed may end one million step scientific ladder
Like people find say interesting wo ever find need likely wo need YOU use article published mine specific information need
And get touch likely meaning pressing need pay well
That last question went tangent
Well get idea
This huge wall text incredibly helpful
I glad helped someone
I wish someone given kinda talk early college
I know pain as talk every type professor college benefit gain zillion time effort put
Wow really helpful thanks
The problem I daunting crossroad life year old friend seem really ready degree already chose
I hand completely lost feel mounting pressure
That problem right
A lot friend chose career one two reason They experience degree example I know lot medical student family member major medical problem
They seen people job decided Hey
The vast majority student pick degree sound good
I know I try talk people degree kinda job get EXACTLY job clue
They paper
That I recommended going talking people
It give lot perspective REALLY
Mostly work want find something need look intangible benefit
You make money anywhere
You could making driving truck somewhere
And people love
That open road new sight new people lot good stuff
But value stability
Truck driving would seem like mini hell small living quarter lot physical interaction people driving day sometimes bad condition
It like
Do like idea office people day alone
Do want creative work physical work
Working team working
Building thing testing thing selling thing helping people helping company
And billion question answer
But help learning real job actually exist
Maybe ca astronaut test Doritos space dream
maybe job never heard like much
Point need go talk people ASAP ask thing important see job like give want
If I would honestly skip college research entrepreneurship
If job existence might well try create one
Computer science I recall hearing CS overtook Harvard adopted elective module
Ca find link quick search though pretty indicative changing demand people level foreseeing
It important people realize BOTH degree mathematics oriented
So many people CS department drop instant work predicate logic
They act surprised need semester calculus multiple discrete math class degree
Seriously university student per section
CS
Both required
Both
I CS degree would surprised anybody needing take calculus class one
That seems like pretty arbitrary requirement
I took calc college
I senior year CS program required three semester calc
I university North Carolina
When get degree
Did take linear algebra differential equation

I take linear algebra differential equation
I sure different school kind different program requirement
The mention calculus specifically surprising calculus particularly relevant Computer Science
Things like linear algebra probability graph set theory seem way important though course problem domain would certainly use CS calculus solve important interesting problem
Agreed
Calculus pretty irrelevant someone like going IA design Take little bit make decision
Do dad bachelor econ master comp sci
He well lead architect major bank credit card web service
Computational Economics
Seriously enjoy job look back say I future
YEAH
I think institution offer
That kind degree sound like graduate degree get c degree economics degree
At UC Berkeley judging op username go I think design program given parameter guidance
It difficult may worth
I hear Cal EECS joke
Just undergrad master double major instead
dude comp sci major make bank Econ major make bank well
If go quantitative opposed qualitative
Well money quantitative I see qualitative relevant
If argument suggesting otherwise I willing hear
Oh I meant track Econ major would choose
Like econometrics data analysis le math oriented course
The math oriented major tend make significantly Oh gotcha sense I would agree
I specializing business forecasting big emphasis econometrics average salary something like
Economics general average starting salary
Computer Science much higher starting average
Whatever find interesting
They pretty valuable current economy seems
Although I imagine CS would probably marketable far finding job go
If freshman try taking class major thing side see really interest
Better find early college career switching end sophomore year uncertain panic
Do find programming spare time

Major
If Econ Major
Minor figure along way
Either way I think solid set university major
As someone currently pursuing Master Economics I quite sure whether support another person entering field tell run far far away
I think pursue CS burgeoning field seems bright future industry
I see someone CS knowledge ever becoming irrelevant unless lost technology one day
Economics moment seems crossroad modernising
We new field behavioural economics someone master traditional econ programme I wo get insight field unless I PhD something sort
I feeling student taught model already become redundant may soon fall path
Therefore I think Economics best choice make juncture
However econometrics amazing
Definitely take course
Maybe kind statistic minor
tl dr CS future Economics rut
Statistics amazing
The problem economics school people view people business school reject even though need get
Apparently people dislike economics
I know
Play eve look spreadsheet trade item across galaxy learning basic economics like S D
ON THE COMPUTER
IN SPACE
Lots friend I college went comp sci thinking thats wanted realized amount pointless code write hated
There lot problem solving also lot mindless coding
That said CS definitely safer career choice Whatever interest
I computer science student I know everyone especially involves much math physic electronics different stuff expect scientific mind cope I guess
Economics
Study computer science time
What learn college outdated time graduate anyway
Economics
You NOT need
degree know program well
It joke think otherwise
deleted I want people think college route learning
You really power learn anything mean
Yes
You need degree well
With free resource information learn program better typical CS grad
However employer want see degree certificate consider somebody unqualified mind
Yes certificate sure
But op worry much even though pay higher
If truly love programming computer science push hard maybe bos enough experience D To think Computer Science programming would foolish
I problem
I economics major I love econ I switched chemical engineering I also love math I wanted get degree guaranteed income potential
I miss economics
friend minor It would make sense
Before I wanted economic analysis think tank like The Cato Institute The Mises Institute
Now I wanting design chemical plant many word
Those two career path completely unrelated
Also I using GI Bill wo cover class toward minor
Are full time student
In experience least matter many class I took hitting full time cost tuition stayed would matter
However I idea detail case ca get minor kinda suck My worry I running time
College go quick
It go quick even though I freshman lol
You computational economics best world
My economics teacher engineering school always told u thought would make lot money field economics real money
So money biggest factor economics never fail
But looking something diverse job field pay shabby I highly recommend comp engineering
So much opportunity
Two people I know graduated year double major job offer Christmas one writing android apps writing layout insurance company
You never work get bored much learn
Double Major Computer Science reason A get lot job opportunity I mean really A LOT B still work economist change mind math crucial field
I neither computer scientist economist I work financial institution couple friend degree I know I talking
Definitely computer science
You clearly interested could major CS minor Economics aced sorted life
Computer science
If want change later career easier change economics learned business work actually
I pursuing economics degree currently actually started intro computer science course required major
The two go together well could always major one minor
I Economics major obviously preference given interest economics computerscience I would suggest take Economics familiarize line thinking combine statistical well computer technical aspect Big Data
That combination unbelievably valuable future
STEM job lacking properly skilled worker large skill shortage long time
The two go together quite well economist understands write efficient program definitely dominate field long understand math obviously
Do econ get CS minor
CS
programming future source spent month looking engineering job looking CS grad Either math intensive despite simple intro class seem
If math thing work bit harder classmate
It still doable build solid study group
Honestly though coming Econ grad bit many different subject decide
What class look forward
It easier make class taken whim switch major
I make choice
I chose economics
Business interest I originally stsrted marketing switched economics super interesting
Comp Sci cool though computer science I would recommend economics degree much broad choice going many job possibility economics even computer science company way around
But remember something actually want Computer science IT larger growing field
But enjoy
CS major go IT
If I read one article computer science doomed field Indians got hired work IT people stupid business I swear
Guess I need reading whoopsies

We love sweet treat occasionally give
You know I talking piece cake candy bar
Whatever guilty pleasure know special treat limit occasionally indulging
Let imagine hard week work decide treat cupcake favorite bakery
After eating cupcake think week stressful I deserve second cupcake
While standing line second time notice one favorite cupcake left another customer ahead
While customer might choose something else worry cupcake gone
After long stressful week need satisfaction consuming one cupcake
What need experience
So term marginal benefit mean
It additional satisfaction get consume additional good service
It also maximum amount willing pay consume additional good service
So bakery example marginal benefit satisfaction get eat one cupcake
It also maximum amount money willing pay purchase last cupcake someone else
It important note good service consume le willing pay additional good service
This benefit good service decrease quantity consumed increase
Get FREE access day create account
Let look another example help explain marginal benefit
Imagine pizza joint
While overhear person next table say starving want purchase another slice pizza
In fact claim hungry willing pay single slice
Thus marginal benefit person consuming another slice pizza
Keep mind slice pizza individual consumes le willing pay next slice
This benefit additional slice pizza decrease quantity consumed increase
In lesson learned additional satisfaction get consume one additional good service
It also maximum willing pay obtain additional good service
However good service consume le willing pay good service simply benefit additional good service decrease quantity consumed increase

The solution examines economics marginal labor profit determine Pam buy printer

In marginal revenue increase gross revenue company gain producing one additional unit good one additional unit output
Marginal revenue also defined gross revenue generated last unit sold
In perfectly competitive market one firm large enough hold market power set price good business sell good sell good market price marginal revenue would simply equivalent market price
But condition required perfect competition relatively perfectly competitive market existence
For highly specialized low output industry however concept marginal revenue becomes complex firm output affect market price
That say industry market price decrease higher production increase lower production
Let take look simple example
Marginal revenue calculated dividing change total revenue change production output quantity change quantity sold
Take example hockey stick manufacturer
The manufacturer revenue produce output hockey stick total revenue
Assume manufacturer sell first unit
This brings marginal revenue total revenue divided quantity sold
But let say firm must lower price increase sale
So company sell second unit
The marginal revenue gained producing second hockey stick change total revenue divided change quantity sold
In case marginal revenue gained le price company able charge additional unit price reduction reduced unit revenue
Another way think marginal revenue example marginal revenue price company received additional unit le revenue lost reducing price unit sold prior price reduction
Marginal revenue follows law diminishing return hold production process adding one production factor holding production factor constant eventually generate lower return due input used le efficiently
For resource marginal revenue sure check following There error

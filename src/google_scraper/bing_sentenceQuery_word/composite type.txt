In constructed program using composite type
It sometimes called although latter term may also refer etc
The act constructing composite type known
A notion composite type datatype composes fixed set labeled
It called keyword used declaring short precisely
In difference default class Note class completely new already crude type For intent purpose form C virtually valid C valid semantics
A declaration consists list field type
The total storage required object sum storage requirement field plus internal
For example defines type
To create new variable type write integer component accessed component accessed well component
The structure contains four value four field may changed independently
Since writing repeatedly code becomes cumbersome unusual see statement C code provide convenient synonym
For example In code needed type defined using already part regular namespace type referred either simply
As another example Vector composite type us floating point data type could created A variable named composite type would declared Members would accessed using dot notation
For example would set component equal
Likewise color structure could created using In graphic usually must keep track position color vertex
One way would create composite type using previously created composite type Create variable type using format Assign value component like The primary use construction complex datatypes sometimes used create primitive
For example since requires two structs initial field field represented way code work correctly
constructed primitive composite type serve type constructing composite type

In either following In programming language basic data type
In addition many language also provide set composite data type
Opinions vary whether type composite considered primitive
Depending language implementation primitive data type may may correspondence object computer memory
However one usually expects operation basic primitive data type fastest language construct
Integer addition example performed single machine instruction offer specific instruction process sequence character single instruction
In particular standard mention int object natural size suggested architecture execution environment
This mean likely bit long architecture
Basic primitive type almost always
Most language allow behavior capability primitive either basic data type modified program
Exceptions include permit data type extended within program adding operation performed even redefining operation
The actual range primitive data type available dependent upon specific programming language used
For example composite data type whereas modern dialect assimilated primitive data type basic
Classic basic primitive type may include More sophisticated type include An data type represents
Integers may either signed allowing negative value unsigned
Common range Literals integer written regular numeral consisting sequence digit negation indicated value
However programming language disallow use comma
Examples integer literal There several alternate method writing integer literal many programming language A type typically denoted bool boolean typically either true false
Although one bit necessary accommodate value set true false programming language typically implement boolean type one byte
Many language
implement booleans adhering concept distinct logical type
Languages though may implicitly convert booleans time give extended semantics booleans boolean expression achieve backwards compatibility earlier version language
For example former standard dedicated boolean type
Instead numeric value zero interpreted false value interpreted true
add distinct boolean type included support type true false reserved word
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally format equivalent typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
Many language often called float type
Literals floating point number include decimal point typically use denote scientific notation
Examples literal Some language also type comprising two number real part imaginary part
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally form typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
number also tend limited range value programmer must careful avoid overflow intermediate calculation well final result
A type typically called char may contain single specialized code
In defined smallest addressable unit memory
On system Several standard require size
Some language two character type example type character type character
The term character type normally used even type whose value precisely represent example code unit
Characters may combined
The string data include number numerical symbol treated text
Strings implemented various way depending programming language
The simplest way implement string create array character followed delimiting character used signal end string usually
These referred usually found language low amount
While easy implement null terminated string criticized causing
Most scripting language many dialect separate character type string length one normally used represent single character
Some language capability use string usually measure additionally provide class string handling respectively standard library
There also difference whether string mutable language
Mutable string may altered creation whereas immutable string maintain constant size content
In latter way alter string create new one
There advantage disadvantage approach although immutable string much le flexible simpler completely
Some example language use mutable string include whereas language include
A language provide different type mutable immutable string
Literals character string usually surrounded sometimes single quote used character double quote used string
Examples character literal C syntax Examples string literal C syntax Each numeric data type maximum minimum value known
Attempting store number outside range may lead error incorrect calculation due depending language used
The range variable based number byte used save value integer data type usually able store value number contribute value
For data type
value range complicated vary depending method used store
There also type use entire byte
boolean requires single represents value although practice byte often used remaining bit redundant
Some programming language also allow opposite direction programmer defines range precision needed solve given problem compiler chooses appropriate integer type automatically

Please help trying understand I need use WCF service hence I need clearer understanding
It difficult tell asked
This question ambiguous vague incomplete overly broad rhetorical reasonably answered current form
For help clarifying question reopened
A composite data type something divide multiple type
A box contains box
If box empty elementary data type
A box contains another box composite type separate smaller type
Say type represents mob game
How divide smaller object better understand represent
That mob contains information name attack hit point equipment
Now name could represented string elementary type
The hit point represented number simple type
Empty box follow example
But equipment
It could represented composite type
An array string sake example
Each mob list carry
It could carry sword boot anything else
An array composite type separate bunch object string multiple string object
Now attack
We need string number represent one attack
We need name amount damage inflicts also extra effect inflict
This would box contains box
Lastly think composite type class array struct tree Hope help understand

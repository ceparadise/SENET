A existence thing may said depend upon subject
This contrast object existence seem depend existence mind
In particularly within psychology explanatory variable directly observable
For example concept used explain phenomenon neither directly observable
A hypothetical construct differs property implication demonstrated empirical research
These serve guide research
An intervening variable hand summary observed empirical finding
The creation construct part especially creation
The usefulness one conceptualization another depends largely
To address construct federal agency created construct database termed GEM improve construct use reuse
Concepts considered definition include designated symbol word
Scientific
well classification
biological also conceptual entity considered
Simple example real construct include
Cronbach Meehl define hypothetical construct single observable referent directly observed exist multiple referent none
For example according Cronbach Meehl fish hypothetical construct despite variation specie variety fish agreed upon definition fish specific characteristic distinguish fish bird
Furthermore fish directly observed
On hand hypothetical construct single referent rather hypothetical construct consist group functionally related behavior attitude process experience
Instead seeing intelligence love fear see indicator manifestation agreed call intelligence love fear
McCorquodale Meehl discussed distinction called intervening variable hypothetical construct
McCorquodale Meehl describe hypothetical construct containing surplus meaning imply operation measured
In positivist tradition Boring described intelligence whatever intelligence test measure
As reaction Cronbach Meehl emphasized necessity viewing construct like intelligence hypothetical construct
They asserted adequate criterion operational definition construct like ability personality
Thus according Cronbach Meehl useful construct intelligence personality imply simply test score
Instead construct predict wide range behavior

Informative advertising drive primary demand competitive advertising drive secondary demand
Images Selective marketing also known selective advertising refers marketing initiative created generate interest specific brand abandoning concentration product category class
Unlike traditional marketing campaign tout effectiveness product consuming public general selective marketing campaign target specific customer group based market demographic gender age income
Selective marketing tactic use variety tactic distinguish brand others product category
These include classifying brand mature refined taste competition accentuating brand quality design construction reinforcing brand historical relevance longevity
These strategy attempt paint competitive brand generic unreliable lesser quality reinforcing perception historical prominence quality cultural superiority brand focus selective campaign
Selective marketing campaign often include promotional event specifically catered brand target demographic
Unlike preemptive marketing tactic direct mail billboard telemarketing blanket consumer attempt draw specific market segment selective marketing target segment directly
These selective tactic include ad specific consumer publication subscription based email newsletter promotional event
The major advantage selective advertising initiative higher return advertising investment
Selective advertising reduces extra time money spent constructing producing advertising message directed audience may outside brand target market
In addition making product brand stand competitor specialized focus specific market area build brand reputation throughout market foster brand loyalty
Selective marketing campaign drawback
Extensive market research resource required allocate information specific market segment long lead time required create print campaign advertising tool specifically
Market saturation another drawback dissuade target audience selective marketing
Lastly poorly conceived ineffectively marketing campaign may cheapen lessen image product brand within market

In feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Apart case always achieved selectively altering based condition
In language term conditional usually used whereas term conditional conditional construct preferred term distinct meaning
A conditional sometimes colloquially referred especially perceived simple one specific form irrelevant unknown
Although usually classified conditional construct another way select alternative
The construct sometimes called common across many programming language
Although syntax varies language language basic structure form look like In example code part represented constitutes conditional intrinsic value may substituted either value intrinsic meaning
In contrast combination expression surrounding consequent follows afterward constitute conditional intrinsic meaning expressing coherent logical rule intrinsic value
When find expects condition example mean variable x contains number greater zero evaluates condition
If condition statement following executed
Otherwise execution continues following branch either usually optional branch
After either branch executed return point
In early programming language especially dialect statement could contain statement
This led style programming known program style called
As result allows virtually arbitrary statement put statement block inside statement gained popularity became norm even BASIC programming circle
Such mechanism principle based older advanced family language language influenced modern BASIC variant many year
While possible using statement statement write program spaghetti code well structured readable program written structured programming language structured programming make easier enforces
Structured statement like example one key element structured programming present popular programming language
A subtlety optional else clause found many language mean since conditionals parsed multiple way
Specifically parsed depending whether associated first second
This known problem resolved various way depending language
By using possible combine several condition
Only statement following first condition found true executed
All statement skipped
The statement simply followed
In Ada difference one needed one us instead followed
This similar provides keyword avoid large number brace would required multiple statement also us special keyword structure denoted indentation rather brace repeated use would require increased indentation every condition
Similarly earlier UNIX shell later gathered POSIX shell syntax use elif giving choice delimiting space line break
However many language directly descended Algol special syntax construct present present many syntactical derivative C PHP
This work language statement case follow conditional without enclosed block
This design choice slight cost code branch effectively adding extra nesting level complicating job compiler implementors analyse implement arbitrarily long chain recursively
If term sequence conditionals testing value single expression alternative also called
Conversely language switch statement produced sequence statement
Many language support similar statement return value result
Thus true expression evaluate value statement change program state perform kind action
member family allow expression In dialect first inspired great extent ALGOL In part compulsory every expression must value
Logic would expressed conditionals language usually expressed recursive function
Because Haskell possible write control structure ordinary expression lazy evaluation mean evaluate condition proper branch strict language would evaluate three
It written like language special conditional expression function may described template like This mean inlined expression unlike language compared expression similar Ruby Scala among others
To accomplish using would take one line code typical layout convention Some argue explicit statement easier read may compile efficient code ternary operator others argue concise expression easier read statement spread several line
First user run program cursor appears waiting reader type number
If number greater text My variable named
displayed screen
If number smaller message My variable named
printed screen
In language function called provided used conditional expression
However behave like true conditional expression true false branch always evaluated result one thrown away result returned IIf function
Up language Fortran arithmetic statement halfway computed IF case statement based This earliest conditional statement Fortran Where e numeric expression necessarily integer equivalent Because equivalent multiple statement could jump anywhere considered unstructured control statement used structured statement used
In practice observed arithmetic statement referenced following statement one two label
This conditional control statement original implementation Fortran computer
On computer three address three state
Other computer would flag register positive zero negative even overflow carry associated last arithmetic operation would use instruction accumulator negative accumulator zero similar
Note expression evaluated case integer arithmetic overflow may occur overflow carry flag would considered also
In contrast language conditional statement defined class abstract method take two parameter
two subclass define method executing first closure executing second closure
In concept conditional expressed using expression ifThenElse passed two function left right conditionals also pas empty tuple result ifThenElse order actually call chosen function otherwise ifThenElse return function object without getting called
In system number used without definition like Lisp Traditional paper math expressed single closure Here true false ifThenElse bound respective definition passed scope end block
A working JavaScript analogy using function single variable rigor The code multivariable function look like another version earlier example without system number assumed
First example show first branch taken second example show second branch taken
Smalltalk us similar idea true false representation True False singleton object respond message differently
Haskell used use exact model Boolean type time writing Haskell program use syntactic sugar b else c construct unlike ifThenElse compose unless either wrapped another function shown The Haskell section page
language multiway branch compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In dynamic language case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
may seen sophisticated alternative statement
It available many programming language functional programming feature many others
Here simple example written language The power pattern matching ability match action also pattern data
Here example written illustrates feature This code defines function applies first argument function element second argument list return resulting list
The two line two definition function two kind argument possible case one list empty return empty list case list empty
Pattern matching strictly speaking choice construct possible Haskell write one alternative guaranteed always matched situation used choice construct simply way bind name value
However frequently used choice construct language available
In programming language comparable data structure idiomatic use implement conditional assignment
In language allow programmer assign named function variable reference conditional flow implemented using hash
An alternative conditional branch instruction
Predication feature enables instruction conditionally executed instead modifying
This table refers recent language specification language
For language specification latest officially released implementation referred

This quite interesting
Of course initially meant
Here etymology word Then Edwin observation confirmed nebula saw actually beyond galaxy universe fact galaxy
Suddenly universe much bigger
But still called universe even became much larger imagined
Though principle concept multiple conceived quite thought idea multiple world universe absurd philosopher like John Duns Scotus pondered whether God created multiplicity world would best possible could imagined multiplicity world universe would actually entail
With newly emerging Erwin plurality world described alternative really happen grew need new word refer fundamental construct came call multiverse
At point universe longer totality thing totality thing within one universe construct
So I think question really need refer something greater multiverse
I mean might imagine set universe like And call tower multiverse
But stack tower would larger multiverse construct
If look multiverse governed eternal inflation universe emerge universe due differently inflation region due quantum foam seem obvious multiverse construct extended
I mean extend infinitely would still part multiverse construct Although could consider individual branch distinct
explored idea little theological To help illustrate point I made new term triaverse tesseraverse penteverse exiverse eptaverse oktoverse etc
You borrow term use construct fundamental presumed extended totality wish
entirely sure useful
After multiverse alone already beyond science may forever remain part philosophy rather science
But separate
In case I suppose could indeed think word describe plurality multiverses
Although individual tree
It seems like plurality Gods
There redundancy
On hand presumed Milky Way discovered one many recent estimate put amount trillion
We figured Milky Way one many island universe universe one many
After gravely mistaken true extent totality thing
And maybe craziest idea indeed multiverse could one many
Now I could think new term refer totality multiverse construct I think sense already name
It refer fundamental construct multiverse specifically like term I would say infinitely I mean time
No separate tree
This possibly infinite forest
called
This philosophical theory proposed Max Tegmark pose existence fundamentally mathematical computable mathematical structure exist
Since plurality multiverses presumed computable mathematical structure well would ultimate version

North Beauregard Alexandria VA Tel Fax International Access Code Edited Richard Villa Jacqueline Thousand Mary Falvey Christine Givner What inclusive school look sound like
The following scenario describes typical day freshman language art class student attending ordinary yet extraordinary high school large urban school district
The student Rice third period finished reading final chapter Harper Lee
Some student listened book tape literacy level student given created graphic organizer help organize key idea
The student working grade California literacy standard reading book
Although student diverse learning style ability challenged meaningful way relate grade standard
Rice assigned culminating task asks student creatively depict character demonstrated courage conviction
He also distributed rubric describing assignment evaluated
Several student Rice class qualify special education five qualify gifted talented service
In collaboration Rice coordinator gifted talented support service Stremel contracted five student meet also exceed assignment rubric
Rice Stremel available time assist guide five student complete modified assignment help student assignment
Mikel Rice special education support teacher also classroom available help student eligible special education anyone else seek assistance
Jesús one Rice third period student qualifies special education service learning disability
He read well grade level excellent verbal skill
For assignment Jesús partnered Emily high reading writing skill struggle verbal skill
The two student use complementary strength put together joint presentation character demonstrated courage conviction
George student autism Quon receive guidance designing presentation
George show picture character brief written description Quon composed
Lonny socially talented senior completing community service requirement supporting George student third period class
Casandra multiple disability us electric get around electronic communication aid convey thought response
Casandra partner Jimmy classmate qualifies gifted talented service
Jimmy surf Web information related topic decides Casandra include presentation
Casandra Jimmy enter content Casandra electronic communication device voice output activated deliver presentation class
Two student learner
One student speaks Cantonese speaks Spanish
Each partnered bilingual classmate
The two pair student prepare bilingual presentation language one pair Cantonese English pair Spanish English
All visual aid also presented language
The composition Rice class reflects diversity classroom United States
At one time many student class would labeled forced separate class thereby limiting exposure one another essential curriculum varied instructional procedure personnel
Some student would moved gifted talented program
Jesús Casandra George would classified disabled placed segregated special education program
The student speaking language English would placed separate bilingual program would limited exposure peer
Some people argue social justice occurring Rice responsibility school
However inclusive education school responsibility whose
Our country system institution teach example country state community value either inclusion segregation exclusion
Inclusive education demand school create provide whatever necessary ensure student access meaningful learning
It require student posse particular set skill ability prerequisite belonging
The legal mandate driving inclusive education United States Public Law
Individuals Disabilities Education Act IDEA
Although specific term found
definition LRE key element law
It provided initial legal impetus creating inclusive education
The law state The critical language used law use supplementary aid In
passed professional education literature devoid information strategy using supplementary aid service effectively include student disability
However since time use aid service include student frequently identified described literature
Some recent example include Falvey Fisher Sax Pumpian Janney Snell Kennedy Fisher Thousand Villa Nevin Villa Thousand
As result LRE mandate leading force design implementation inclusive education
Since promulgation IDEA
federal court decision built one another clarify following What inclusion inclusive education
To begin answer question asked thousand child adolescent adult identify event life caused feel included one caused feel excluded
We also asked subject describe felt following two experience
Figure provides sampling feeling people reported experiencing felt included excluded
Examining reaction critical element book educating student
Figure make powerful point one want excluded
Inclusive education embracing everyone making commitment provide student community citizen democracy inalienable right belong
Inclusion assumes living learning together benefit everyone child labeled difference gifted proficient disability
In summary inclusion belief system set strategy
Rice language art class accommodation support attitude disposition school intentionally teach example
Once adopted school school district inclusive vision drive decision action subscribe
People longer ask Why inclusion They ask How successfully include student Inclusion Figure illustrates opposite segregation isolation
Segregated education creates permanent underclass student conveys strong message student measure fit belong
Segregationist thinking assumes right belong earned rather unconditional human right
Norman Kunc speaks casualty exclusion conditional He suggests many current problem facing child youth risk gang suicide dropping school casualty inflexible insensitive system education systematically although perhaps unintentionally destroys student fit In seminal work describes plight youth risk Native American perspective Brendtro Brokenleg Van Bockern describe one four central value create child
The right belong every person birthright
Given increasing number student school centrality need belong school must provide way reclaim youth labeled risk disabled homeless gay lesbian forth
The growing diversity student population school topic great debate concern
Differences among student may include language culture religion gender varied ability sexual preference socioeconomic status geographic setting
The difference often spoken problem rather opportunity learning rich variety exists others life included valued respected welcomed naturally diverse world
In Grant Wiggins wrote following value diversity The call restructuring American education establish meaningful educational standard student outcome hold school accountable accomplishing outcome every student requires great individual collective commitment effort
All restructuring effort school require minimum belief Systems change initiative special education paralleling system change effort general education
Such initiative change often referred school restructuring
Fundamental question regarding effective strategy teaching student raised numerous innovative highly effective strategy designed implemented
School restructuring effort described greater detail Chapters summarized As characteristic school restructuring movement take hold school inclusion student disability become separate distinct action instead occurs simultaneously naturally
The characteristic school restructuring movement building inclusive school student must experience quality education meet specific educational need context political social justice
We offered number way define inclusive school
We subscribe one definition
However believe must create cherish nurture school include effectively educate student
Inclusion benefit student disability also student educator parent community member
Experience tell u community school embrace true meaning inclusion become better able change segregated special education system inclusive service delivery system change society world intolerant fearful difference one embrace celebrates natural diversity meaningful learning
Even inclusion operationally defined remains elusive term
Part confusion arises assumption associated program strategy
The underlying assumption however inclusion way way living based belief individual valued belongs

Joseph Novak Alberto Cañas Institute Human Machine Cognition Pensacola Fl Technical Report IHMC CmapTools Rev Concept map graphical tool organizing representing knowledge
They include concept usually enclosed circle box type relationship concept indicated connecting line linking two concept
Words line referred linking word linking phrase specify relationship two concept
We define The label concept word although sometimes use symbol sometimes one word used
Sometimes called semantic unit unit meaning
Figure show example concept map describes structure concept map illustrates characteristic
Figure
A concept map showing key feature concept map
Concept map tend read progressing top downward
click image display larger image Another characteristic concept map concept represented hierarchical fashion inclusive general concept top map specific le general concept arranged hierarchically
The hierarchical structure particular domain knowledge also depends context knowledge applied considered
Therefore best construct concept map reference particular question seek answer called focus question
The concept map may pertain situation event trying understand organization knowledge form concept map thus providing context concept map
Another important characteristic concept map inclusion
These relationship link concept different segment domain concept map
help u see concept one domain knowledge represented map related concept another domain shown map
In creation new knowledge often represent creative leap part knowledge producer
There two feature concept map important facilitation creative thinking hierarchical structure represented good map ability search characterize new
A final feature may added concept map specific example event object help clarify meaning given concept
Normally included oval box since specific event object represent concept
Concept map developed course Novak research program Cornell sought follow understand change child knowledge science Novak Musonda
During course study researcher interviewed many child found difficult identify specific change child understanding science concept examination interview transcript
This program based learning psychology David Ausubel Ausubel
The fundamental idea Ausubel cognitive psychology learning take place new concept proposition existing concept propositional framework held learner
This knowledge structure held learner also referred individual
Out necessity find better way represent child conceptual understanding emerged idea representing child knowledge form concept map
Thus born new tool use research also many us
The question sometimes arises origin first concept
These acquired child age birth three year recognize regularity world around begin identify language label symbol regularity Macnamara
This early learning concept primarily process individual discerns pattern regularity event object recognizes regularity labeled older person word symbol
This phenomenal ability part evolutionary heritage normal human being
After age new concept propositional learning mediated heavily language take place primarily process new meaning obtained asking question getting clarification relationship old concept proposition new concept proposition
This acquisition mediated important way concrete experience prop available hence importance activity science learning young child also true learner age subject matter domain
In addition distinction discovery learning process attribute concept identified autonomously learner reception learning process attribute concept described using language transmitted learner Ausubel made important distinction
Meaningful learning requires three condition As noted important recognize individual vary quantity quality relevant knowledge posse strength motivation seek way incorporate new knowledge relevant knowledge already posse distinction simple dichotomy rather continuum
Creativity seen high level meaningful learning discus
These idea shown Figure
Figure
Learning vary hightly rote highly meaningful
Creativity result high level meaningful learning
click image display larger image People often confuse rote learning meaningful learning teaching approach vary continuum direct presentation information may conceptually obscure conceptually explicit autonomous discovery approach learner perceives regularity construct concept
Both direct presentation discovery teaching method lead highly rote highly meaningful learning learner depending disposition learner organization instructional material
These distinction shown Figure
There mistaken notion inquiry study assure meaningful learning
The reality unless student posse least rudimentary understanding phenomenon investigating activity may lead little gain relevant knowledge may little busy work
In fact research basis support widely recommended learning largely absent Mayer Kirschner Sweller
Figure
The learning continuum instructional continuum
click image display larger image One powerful us concept map learning tool also evaluation tool thus encouraging student use learning pattern Mintzes Novak Novak Gowin
Concept map also effective identifying valid invalid idea held student discussed another section
They effective clinical interview identifying relevant knowledge learner posse instruction Edwards Fraser
Another important advance understanding learning human memory single vessel filled rather complex set interrelated memory system
Figure illustrates memory system human mind interaction input affective psychomotor input
Figure
Key memory system brain interact learning
click image display larger image While memory system interdependent information going direction critical memory system incorporating knowledge memory working All incoming information organized processed working memory interaction knowledge memory
The limiting feature working memory process relatively small number psychological unit five nine one moment Miller
This mean relationship among two three concept limit working memory processing capacity
For example person presented list letter number memorize second recall
However letter grouped form know word unit number related phone number something known letter number recalled
In related test give learner familiar unrelated word memorize second recall word
If word unfamiliar technical term introduced first time learner may well recall correctly two three
Conversely word familiar related knowledge learner cognitive structure
month year may easily recalled
It noted retention information learned rote still take place long term memory information learned meaningfully difference rote learning little integration new knowledge existing knowledge resulting two negative consequence
First knowledge learned rote tends quickly forgotten unless much rehearsed
Second knowledge structure cognitive structure learner enhanced modified clear faulty idea
Thus misconception persist knowledge learned little potential use learning problem solving Novak
Therefore structure large body knowledge requires orderly sequence iteration working memory memory new knowledge received processed Anderson
We believe one reason concept mapping powerful facilitation meaningful learning serf kind help organize knowledge structure even though structure must built piece piece small unit interacting concept propositional framework
Many learner teacher surprised see simple tool facilitates meaningful learning creation powerful knowledge framework permit utilization knowledge new context also retention knowledge long period time Novak Novak Wandersee
There still relatively little known memory process knowledge finally get incorporated brain seems evident diverse source research brain work organize knowledge hierarchical framework learning approach facilitate process significantly enhance learning capability learner Bransford Tsien
Obviously brain store concept proposition
While latter principal element make knowledge structure form cognitive structure brain pause briefly discus form learning
involves storage image scene encounter people meet photo host image
These also referred iconic memory Sperling
While alphanumeric image Sperling used study quickly forgotten kind image retained much longer
Our brain remarkable capacity acquiring retaining visual image people photo
For example one study Shepard presented picture common scene subject later asked two similar picture shown one seen earlier
After presentation subject correct identifying picture seen
Three day later still correct three month later correct time
This many study shown human remarkable ability recall image although soon forget many detail image
Considering often look penny interesting subject asked draw penny study Nickerson Adams omitted half feature located wrong place
We believe integrating various kind image conceptual framework using concept mapping software like CmapTools described could enhance iconic memory hope research done
Human ability recall sound also remarkable
The learning recall sound also referred memory
Consider musician play hundred song without reading music
Again dealing memory coded concept proposition
Studies Penfield Perot among others indicate region brain activated hear sound region active recall sound
While locate region brain active learning recall information using positron emission tomography PET scan specific mechanism neuron store information known
A full discussion memory mechanism beyond scope document
There obvious difference individual ability explored Gardner
He proposed
His work received much attention education served draw attention broad range difference human ability various kind learning performance
It good school recognizing important human capability recall specific cognitive information often form learning represented test used commonly school corporation
One reason encourage integration broad range activity represented New Model Education provide opportunity ability represented expressed
Nevertheless seen organizing opportunity afforded associating various activity explicit knowledge structure beneficial
Time tell future research study support claim
While true student difficulty building concept map using least early experience appears result primarily year learning practice school setting rather result brain structure difference
learning style difference large extent derivative difference pattern learning student employed varying high commitment continuous learning almost exclusive commitment meaningful mode learning
It easy help student former condition move pattern learning latter type
While concept map help student also need taught something brain mechanism knowledge organization instruction accompany use concept map
The information paragraph become part instructional program skillful use concept map
The information provided document could part instruction
Other idea improving instruction achieve understanding subject available elsewhere Mintzes
To illustrate difficult individual modify idea especially learn primarily rote cite example interview done Private Universe Project PUP Harvard University Schneps
The staff PUP interviewed Harvard graduate alumnus faculty asking Why season Only eleven concept properly organized needed understand season one arrangement concept shown Figure
The PUP interviewer found interviewed could explain season topic taught repeatedly school
Included group graduate recently taken course Physics Planetary Motion also believed erroneously season caused earth moving closer sun summer away winter
In fact earth slightly closer sun winter Massachusetts rather summer
The primary reason season latitude away equator due tilt earth axis toward sun summer resulting longer day direct radiation thus greater heating
In winter axis earth point away sun thus resulting shorter day le intense radiation
What interfering Harvard people confusion common experience closer fire lamp heat intense away
Thus people failed recognize phenomenon operating give season Earth
They transferring knowledge one context another incorrectly
This commonly observed many many example misconception every field study
The solution problem overcoming misconception help learner learn meaningfully using concept map helpful
For information misconception science mathematics see Novak
Figure
One representation knowledge structure required required understanding season
click image display larger image As indicated earlier defined concept
It coming generally recognized meaningful learning process described process used scientist mathematician expert discipline construct new knowledge
In fact Novak argued new nothing relatively high level meaningful learning accomplished individual well organized knowledge structure particular area knowledge also strong emotional commitment persist finding new meaning Novak
branch philosophy deal nature knowledge new knowledge creation
There important relationship psychology learning understand today growing consensus among philosopher epistemologist new knowledge creation constructive process involving knowledge emotion drive create new meaning new way represent meaning
Learners struggling create good concept map engaged creative process challenging especially learner spent life learning rote
Rote learning contributes little best knowledge structure therefore underlie creative thinking novel problem solving
As defined concept proposition building block knowledge domain
We use analogy concept like atom matter proposition like molecule matter
There around different kind atom make infinite number different kind molecule
There word English language concept label combined form infinite number proposition
Although combination word might nonsense still possibility creating infinite number valid meaningful proposition
Poets novelist never run new idea express new way
We shall never run opportunity create new knowledge
As people create observe new existing object event creative people continue create new concents new knowledge
Creating new method observing recording event usually open new opportunity new knowledge creation
For example creation concept mapping method recording subject understanding led new opportunity study process learning new knowledge creation
While value studying extensively process human learning human knowledge creation beyond scope document
The reader invited peruse reference cited
Some important consideration construction better concept map facilitation learning discussed
In learning construct concept map important begin domain knowledge familiar person constructing map
Since concept map structure dependent context used best identify segment text laboratory field activity particular problem question one trying understand
This creates help determine hierarchical structure concept map
It also helpful select limited domain knowledge first concept map
A good way define context concept map construct question clearly specifies problem issue concept map help resolve
Every concept map responds focus question good focus question lead much richer concept map
When learning construct concept map learner tend deviate focus question build concept map may related domain answer question
It often stated first step learning something ask right question
Given selected domain defined question problem domain next step identify key concept apply domain
Usually concept suffice
These concept could listed list rank ordered list established general inclusive concept particular problem situation top list specific least general concept bottom list
Although rank order may approximate help begin process map construction
We refer list concept since move concept concept map determine fit
Some concept may remain parking lot map completed mapmaker see good connection concept map
The next step construct preliminary concept map
This done writing concept TM preferably using IHMC CmapTools Cañas computer software program described
allow group work whiteboard butcher paper move concept around easily
This necessary one begin struggle process building good hierarchical organization
Computer software program even better allow moving concept together linking statement moving group concept link restructure map
When CmapTools used conjunction computer projector two individual easily collaborate building concept map see change progress work
CmapTools also allows collaboration individual room anywhere world map built synchronously asynchronously depending mapmakers schedule
It important recognize concept map never finished
After preliminary map constructed always necessary revise map
Other concept added
Good map usually result three many revision
This one reason using computer software helpful
Once preliminary map built sought
These link concept different segment domain knowledge map help illustrate domain related one another
important order show learner understands relationship map
Figure
A string map created fourth grade student following class field trip paper mill
The class identified concept parking lot left student successful using many map make little sense
This student good oral reader poor reading comprehension committed rote learner see Novak Gowin page
click image display larger image After preliminary map constructed sought
These link concept different segment domain knowledge map help illustrate domain related one another
key show learner understands relationship map
It important help student recognize concept way related one another
Therefore necessary selective identifying precise possible identifying linking word connect concept
In addition one avoid sentence box full sentence used concept since usually indicates whole subsection map could constructed statement box
String map illustrate either poor understanding material inadequate restructuring map
Figure show example string map
Students often comment hard add linking word onto line concept map
This poorly understand relationship concept meaning concept linking word specify relationship
Once student begin good linking word identification good see every concept could related every concept
This also produce frustration must choose identify prominent useful
This process involves Bloom identified high level cognitive performance namely evaluation synthesis knowledge
Concept mapping easy way encourage high level cognitive performance process done well
This one reason concept mapping also powerful evaluation tool Edmondson
Finally map revised concept way lend clarity better structure final map prepared
When computer software used one go back change size font style add color dress concept map
Thus see concept map powerful tool capturing representing archiving knowledge individual also powerful tool create new knowledge
The CmapTools Cañas software available download developed Institute Human Machine Cognition brings together strength concept mapping power technology particularly Internet World Wide Web WWW
The software make easy user age construct modify concept map similar way word processor make easy write text allows user collaborate distance construction map publish concept map anybody Internet access link resource map explain content search WWW information related map
The software allows user link resource photo image graph video chart table text WWW page concept map located anywhere Internet personal file concept linking word concept map simple operation
Links resource displayed icon underneath concept shown Figure
Clicking one icon display list link user select open linked resource
Using CmapTools possible use concept map access material presented digitally including material prepared mapmaker
In way concept map serve indexing navigational tool complex domain knowledge illustrated later NASA material Mars Briggs
By facilitating linking concept map learner construct Cañas Cañas collection concept map linked resource particular topic demonstrating understanding domain limited single concept map
Figure
A concept map bird constructed student
Icons concept provide link resource image picture web page video concept map shown Figure
click image display larger image There growing body research show student work small group cooperate striving learn subject matter positive cognitive affective outcome result Johnson Berk Winsler
Vygotsky introduced idea language social dialogue support learning especially member social group Zone Proximal Development ZPD
He describes ZPD level understanding given subject learner progress minimal aid tutor
When student work cooperatively group use concept map guide learning significantly greater learning occurs Preszler
In work teacher student small group working cooperatively construct concept map proven useful many context
In early Latin America student using IBM Net Internet successful creating concept map student classroom student country Cañas
In class workshop class taught student colleague small group student working collectively construct concept map produce remarkably good map
CmapTools provides extensive support collaborative work concept map construction
The concept map built using CmapTools stored server CmapServers see Cañas anybody Internet access
Many CmapServers public allowing anybody authorization needed publish collection concept map resource Cañas
Through CmapServers user age working many discipline published thousand map topic domain
While concept map public server sample concept map submitted person using CmapTools meet criterion good concept map nevertheless serve illustrate diverse application
When concept map saved CmapServer web page version map also stored WWW browser sufficient browse published concept map
Through storing concept map CmapServers CmapTools encourages collaboration among user constructing map
When map stored server Internet user appropriate permission Cañas edit shared concept map time synchronously convenience asynchronously
Discussion thread Annotations form electronic note used make anecdotal comment concept map map construction
The high degree explicitness concept map make ideal vehicle exchange idea collaborative construction new knowledge
We also found obstacle deriving personal insecurity fear embarrassment largely circumvented since critical comment directed concept map person building map
Having learner comment concept map whether classroom different school effective form collaboration
The extensive support CmapTools provides collaborative construction concept map group whether location distant location encouraged increasing use collaboration map building

For example How measure time given student question answer construction concept map
The type focus question make difference type concept map student build
A question like What plant lead declarative classificatory concept map question Why need plant Experiments show focus question also root concept concept map strong influence quality resulting concept map Derbentseva
It important question given topic
make concept map plant since answering question help student focus map
Whenever concept map made CmapTools saved maker asked provide focus question well key concept concept map
We refer list concept waiting added concept map concept
The staring point construction concept map list concept teacher want make sure student include map
An example given Figure
Figure present focus question parking lot focus question What structure Universe The student group student class expected build concept map answer question includes least concept list
Experienced concept mapper agree researcher challenging difficult aspect constructing concept map constructing proposition determining linking phrase clearly depict relationship concept
So giving student concept take away difficulty map construction although may somewhat limit creativity student selecting concept include
It provide teacher insight concept student trouble integrating concept map indicating little understanding concept

O Donnell Dansereau Hall shown knowledge map act scaffold facilitate learning
It important note expert skeleton concept map built expert topic
The intention expert better selecting small number concept key understanding topic express accurately relationship concept
In general much difficult build good accurate concept map topic small number concept four five fifteen twenty concept
There predetermined size expert skeleton concept map
But expected final number concept map function number concept skeleton
For example skeleton map consists five concept expanded student map concept
If skeleton map contains concept make complete map final map could expected contain concept
In case probably referring using relatively complete skeleton map scaffold expecting student go deeper topic creating several submaps linked starting point map
We foresee program using expert skeleton map scaffold learning beginning development series concept map discipline starting general inclusive idea gradually moving specific concept map guide learner
For example Figure show expert skeleton concept map science encompasses key major concept needed understand science
Learners begin map add concept parking lot link digital resource also construct specific submaps
More specific expert concept map also provided shown Figure
Here also see submap might created group learner sample two resource could accessed via icon submap

Thus one click concept electrical energy Figure selects one search menu option CmapTools retrieve WWW resource deal electricity also relate concept map
The program try figure Cmap prepare query Web search engine generate result relevant idea developed concept map
Of course learner still need select new concept material construct new proposition concept map add meaning clarity map
Thus learner team learner meaning building process essential requirement meaningful learning occur
Learners also engage laboratory field study add important concrete experience needed developing fuller meaning concept sometimes excitement come discovering new idea relationship
The extent material idea built knowledge structure using expert skeleton concept map CmapTools WWW resource far surpass textbook teacher could provide
In fact teacher supervising kind study likely learn many new thing student
Moreover beginning expert skeleton map starting point reduces chance misconception faulty idea held learner teacher reinforced maximize chance build knowledge structure time remove diminish misconception Novak

A pilot program effort already progress Italy Giuseppe Valittuti colleague working translate The World Science book Italian
Valittuti colleague obtained funding Italian Ministry Education teacher training number elementary school team began working World Science concept map resource year
The plan four set school focus different aspect The World Science series produce photo video student project illustrate utilize various science concept
There much feedback classroom helping team refine work sharing electronic portfolio using CmapTools
This feedback help u rapidly refine concept map technique approach improving practice New Model Education
The CmapTools Network may serve clearinghouse effort Public server Italy country
We anticipate abundance anecdotal empirical data flow effort year
Based solid theoretical related research finding available every reason optimistic innovative effort successful
Progress project followed
The greatest challenge may expect change school situational factor direction teacher coach learner prevailing model teacher disseminator information
We know need engage teacher administrator training program model new educational approach need seek counsel way improve New Model Education
There also challenge changing assessment practice rely primarily test measure mainly rote recall information test require student demonstrate understand basic concept use concept novel problem solving use Internet resource grow modify concept learn new concept
There remains New Model plenty room acquisition specific fact procedure learned within context powerful conceptual framework
Research Bransford shown factual information acquired context meaningful learning retained longer information used much successfully solve new problem
We might expect oppositioin implementation New Model Education individual believe inquiry learningis way improve education
In fact research overwhelmingly support value guided learning involved A New Model Education Mayer Kirschner Sweller
There enormous job teacher education need done New Model implemented school
Teachers need become familiar use CmapTools software various tool contains
They also need learn theory underlying concept mapping including idea paper
Teacher education program model kind learning recommending might use expert skeleton concept map concept map available Novak book accessible IHMC Public Cmaps CmapServer reachable CmapTools Places folder World Science
Teachers work collaboratively build simpler concept map dealing education idea perhaps add resource complex concept map
Even current state technology pedagogical understanding possible school state country mount New Model Education
We beginning see many science textbook inclusion concept mapping one way summarize understanding acquired student study unit chapter
Change school practice always slow likely use concept map school instruction increase substantially next decade two
Other innovative practice assessing student understanding subject matter also available Mintzes
When concept map used instruction also used evaluation
There nothing written stone say multiple choice test must used grade school university perhaps time even national achievement exam utilize concept mapping powerful evaluation tool
This problem concept map required national achievement test student given opportunity learn use knowledge representation tool
On hand state regional national exam would begin include concept map segment exam would great incentive teacher teach student use tool
Hopefully next two decade come pas
Currently number project USA elsewhere research see better evaluation tool developed including use concept map
We begin see significant advance area next several year
Some feature latest version CmapTools also facilitate use concept map assessment
For example Compare concept map tool allows comparison expert concept map topic map constructed student similar different concept proposition shown color
In curriculum planning concept map enormously useful
They present highly concise manner key concept principle taught
The hierarchical organization concept map suggests optimal sequencing instructional material
Since fundamental characteristic meaningful learning integration new knowledge learner previous concept propositional framework proceeding general inclusive concept specific information usually serf encourage enhance meaningful learning
Thus curriculum planning need construct global macro map showing major idea plan present whole course whole curriculum also specific micro map show knowledge structure specific segment instructional program
Faculty working independently collaboratively redesign course syllabus entire curriculum
For example faculty working together plan instruction veterinary medicine Cornell University constructed concept map shown Figure
Using concept map planning curriculum instruction specific topic help make instruction conceptually transparent student
Many student difficulty identifying important concept text lecture form presentation
Part problem stem pattern learning simply requires memorization information evaluation information required
Such student fail construct powerful concept propositional framework leading see learning blur myriad fact date name equation procedural rule memorized
For student subject matter discipline especially science mathematics history cacophony information memorize usually find boring
Many feel master knowledge field
If concept map used planning instruction student required construct concept map learning previously unsuccessful student become successful making sense science discipline acquiring feeling control subject matter Bascones Novak Novak

Experts know many thing often articulate well others
This tacit knowledge acquired year experience derives part activity expert involve thinking feeling acting
Often expert speak need get feeling working
In fact biography one Nobel Lauriat biology Barbara McClintock entitled Keller
Nonaka Takeuchi stress importance capturing using knowledge corporate expert tacit knowledge company want become knowledge creating company
Most method used prior concept map consisted various form interview analysis expert including case study expert accomplished remarkable achievement Hoffman Klein Hoffman
In fact method continue highly popular many cognitive scientist unfamiliar Ausubel work kind epistemological idea concept mapping based
We also used clinical interview early work noted found necessary invent better way represent learner knew knowledge changing time
At IHMC began using interview identify expert knowledge needed interpret computer reading computer output machine designed ass problem heart function following injection bolus radioactive solution diagnose coronary dysfunction Ford Ford
However began concept map expert knowledge cardiologist literally wrote book technology evident concept missing map tacit knowledge expert fully expressed book interview
Thus concept map allowed u represent expert knowledge also find gap knowledge structure procuring interview
While expect interview case study analysis critical incident analysis similar technique value extracting representing expert knowledge likely end product study might still best represented form concept map perhaps interview data information presented icon map
At IHMC continue active area capturing representing expert knowledge Coffey
As CmapTools software evolved become increasingly useful tool work illustrated remarkable resource Mars prepared NASA Ames Center Mars Exploration Briggs
Figure show Home concept map knowledge portfolio Briggs created Figure show one many submaps created
The entire set concept map viewed
In addition submaps wide variety digital resource accessed via concept map
Many project represented IHMC Public CmapServer accessible CmapTools including project dealing weather forecasting Hoffman see electronic technician Coffey Thai fabric craft

While first glance concept map may appear another graphic representation information understanding foundation tool proper use lead user see truly profound powerful tool
It may first look like simple arrangement word hierarchy care used organizing concept represented word proposition idea formed linking word one begin see good concept map simple also elegantly complex profound meaning
Concept mapping shown help learner learn researcher create new knowledge administrator better structure manage organization writer write evaluator ass learning
As tool also misused illustrated example
We also wish use document foundation experimentation critique dialogue regarding use tool
The CmapTools web site provides opportunity lively exchange among user researcher
This document living document revision occurring periodically gain new knowledge experience use tool
We invite user concept mapping CmapTools participate dialogue

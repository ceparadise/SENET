University Virginia NSF See also Anita Jones CACM Viewpoint In recent year academic department industrial research laboratory government agency appeared offer dramatically increasing number postdoctoral position computer science engineering CRA
In particular data Computing Research Association CRA annual Taulbee Survey indicate number recent pursuing postdoc following graduate school soared rolling average increase percent period
Because research organization suddenly channeling many young researcher position incumbent upon u community clear understanding associated pursuing hosting nurturing postdoc
The intent white paper articulate best practice several constituency involved
We make recommendation expectation postdoc duty advisor directly supervises postdoc responsibility host organization
We also suggest supporting role advisor might play
Importantly role responsibility constituency postdoctoral experience
In developing white paper rely extensively landmark study published National Academies
We found report provide comprehensive collection best practice postdoc date decade following original publication
We highly recommend resource deeper reading subject interested invested ensuring successful postdoctoral experience within computer science engineering community
In fall member CCC Council activity Computing Research Association CRA sought understand recent growth number computer science engineering pursuing postdoctoral position following graduate school
Working umbrella CRA CCC Council member together colleague CRA Board Directors produced white paper presenting articulating
This white paper served engage computing community conversation postdoc faculty postdoc graduate student encouraged discus various issue within group department institution submit consensus view public website
Following month discussion within computing department institution CRA Board Directors released consensus white paper spring providing statement community concerned postdoctoral experience computing
The consensus document specified
Most recently CRA Board approached member CCC Council produce white paper articulating postdoctoral fellow advisor mentor supporting department institution increase likelihood positive postdoctoral experience throughout computer science engineering community
This white paper describes best practice
Before delving best practice important first define mean postdoctoral position experience
A postdoc opportunity person recently completed deepen expertise research skill short period time en route permanent position
While postdoc may accept position many different reason including ability work tutelage specific expert perhaps highly regarded institution gain exposure related research area change field altogether
An individual pursues postdoc may reason go beyond For example may wish strengthen research portfolio anticipation competitive job search synchronize job search timing significant
Postdoctoral position come various way offered academic department typically come formal teaching duty b offered faculty member funded grant c funded national fellowship fellowship foundation
In c postdoctoral fellow often free choose academic institution go
Henceforth focus document experience postdoc receives settled one type postdoc position
sharpen research skill insight knowledge provide opportunity build robust record publication conference presentation enlarge group peer prospective collaborator know respect postdoc work
That said
Postdocs academia paid rate substantially lower colleague roughly comparable education experience junior faculty colleague industry
In university postdoc considered employee therefore provided fewer lesser benefit area health care retirement access childcare access wellness center
And postdoctoral position taken shortly completion degree usually short period time year often time many wish start family health career marriage may suffer
For instance relocation difficult woman men nurturing young family delaying bearing child significant health implication woman
Much detail benefit drawback postdoctoral position available
In section define set best practice postdoc advisor host organization advisor
We focus core requirement expectation individual
This summary comprehensive recognize every individual situation unique characteristic
However believe following best practice reviewing additional resource topic see Bibliography provide pathway successful postdoctoral experience constituency involved
Because computer science engineering community far le experience postdoctoral position science engineering discipline especially important postdoc discipline applying interviewing postdoc midst one
The primary purpose postdoctoral experience serve holding pattern individual seek permanent position academia industry government elsewhere
Rather noted National Academies study postdoctoral position seek Put simply postdoctoral experience provide postdoc opportunity enhance research experience become truly independent thinker researcher become known throughout community virtue publishing presenting result professional meeting advance career networking colleague
Depending upon research laboratory industrial postdoc also opportunity become involved company strategy session trained business technical presentation
Indeed attribute paramount individual seek fulfills postdoc
Before committing pursuing postdoctoral position
The postdoctoral experience currently become future requirement following completion dissertation one career interest
For example university hiring committee perform requisite analysis hire individual fresh program quality research frequently evident graduation without assurance given publication
Nor best interest individual advisor host organization community whole one pursue multiple postdoc many year
Rather graduating student consult advisor long dissertation defense understand landscape career possibility requisite path whether postdoc one academia industry government appropriate beneficial context student intended career
To end initial best practice prospective postdoc must knowledgeable appropriate pursue postdoc first place electing pursue one decision made lightly considered default choice graduate
When individual seeking postdoc
Every individual unique
As noted previously choose pursue postdoc receive training particular expert
Others wish expand research interest skill set
Still others desire holding pattern synchronize significant
But two characteristic consistent everyone recent graduate ensure future postdoctoral position enable acquire experience necessary advance career b contribute intellectual advancement program advisor research accomplishment personal growth interaction others
In word postdoc ensure postdoc environment one solely discretion advisor rather postdoc must seek environment afford flexibility necessary develop independent thinker making significant intellectual contribution research program honing professional development
It always desirable
Some question consider asking choosing advisor noted National Academies report extended encompass industry perspective Once postdoctoral position postdoc right In addition important postdoc exposed authoring research proposal reviewing research others peer review either journal conference funding agency etc
activity develop skill relevant postdoc future career objective
One set core competency postdoc might seek attain established National Postdoctoral Association found
Additional factor contributing successful postdoctoral experience discussed
As general rule postdoc
In addition problem arise research environment postdoc feel comfortable raising advisor
In industry annual performance evaluation common may opportunity postdoc provide written feedback advisor
If problem persist postdoc unfiltered access others within host department organization without fear punishment retribution leader step situation warrant described
In summary postdoc must take responsibility career especially time transition training position independent position
The element successful postdoctoral experience variable postdoctoral population
For one unabashedly upbeat postdoc fellowship call Sue element included early preparation supportive colleague fascinating research topic opportunity learn time management effective mentor
Even graduate student Sue began building tie research group wanted go postdoc
To get experience offer something
I graduate work system modeling I wanted work group computational biology I able show I something contribute
I began project I graduate school transition fairly smooth
One reason postdoc expand one field study best lay groundwork I always know I going fairly easy seek good advice constructive criticism institution elsewhere
A big challenge difference graduate school got start putting together professional network collaborator friend going building career
It good habit spend time every week meeting new people networking looking people successful see I loved work one reason successful
I published multiple conference paper two year postdoc including one
I got work variety problem without getting stuck something narrow
I fortunate enough great deal freedom
I could follow intellectual curiosity allowed productive
I opportunity propose research get I spun wheel first month trying figure first advantage experience
If going independent researcher sooner later got learn fly plane
When I grad student I used instrument work time cheap anyone else
When I became postdoc I paid I technical staff
I big adjustment mindset organizing better making wisest investment I saw advisor several time week
He involved research right
He always supportive gave long leash made sure I got give talk important conference
He postdoc made sure certain door unlocked
What advantage go door business
Again one going fly plane
In end I fortunate enough hired institution I I opportunity engage broader research community first time beyond advisor research group beyond department institution
For example advisor encouraged present multiple major research conference area work consequently I able deep stimulating discussion senior leader field came work collaborator mine
My advisor also encouraged serve reviewer journal article grant application thereby learning work others area providing new insight research The postdoctoral advisor advisor supervisor record
But best advisor much become
They see relationship postdoc one postdoc motivated exchange skill hard work guidance entrée professional world advisor stand gain training energy enthusiasm postdoc make possible advisor research program advance
Indeed best situation postdoc becomes valued colleague potential collaborator advisor following completion postdoctoral experience
Creating productive mentoring relationship take considerable time effort part advisor postdoc
As professional relationship requires
Often advisor lack time give rise neglect misunderstanding
It therefore essential advisor attentive need postdoc throughout experience
Open channel communication requisite advisor provide environment postdoc encouraged come forward question problem concern
Moreover advisor make clear others within host department organization would supportive need arises must retaliate postdoc take particular concern individual
From supervisory standpoint advisor must make clear postdoc must return learn understand postdoc expectation experience
Once specified advisor conjunction postdoc whether postdoc wish pursue career academia industry mean somewhat different experience appropriate knowledge skill base postdoc activity host advisor research group
Of key importance selecting research problem potential allow postdoc plan postdoc publish receive appropriate recognition work way timely generally consistent respect postdoc search next ideally permanent position
In word postdoc computing considered glorified software engineer programmer
The individual development plan also provide postdoc learn enhance research skill presenting paper writing orally authoring research proposal reviewing research document others networking research peer technical meeting etc
In case reasonable postdoc involved given opportunity participate organization hiring professional learn peer evaluated
Perhaps significantly individual development plan something revisited frequently least several time year ensure adequate progress satisfactory completion goal continued growth postdoc
For detail individual development plan including web application aim guide scientist conﬁdential rigorous process introspection create customized career plan see
Indeed postdoc need regular feedback quality direction work including written evaluation consistent regularity
The advisor attentive need postdoc striving become better researcher colleague
Most postdoc need guidance especially early stage postdoctoral experience
They however need desire micromanaging
The advisor goal thus allow postdoc grow toward independence relationship becomes collaborative one
To end advisor set research framework advisor introduce postdoc potential collaborator influential colleague ensure postdoc adequate resource research program advise trapped narrow unpromising line work
Inherently every postdoc posse different base skill set require different kind nurturing
The advisor take lead discussing early often especially new postdoc postdoc country ethical standard may differ
In particular critically important advisor postdoc discus issue authorship plagiarism conflict interest avoid misunderstanding provide appropriate training postdoc long term
Advisors also take responsibility guiding postdoc search next position
No advisor want lose productive research group member every advisor must cognizant primary objective mentoring postdoc
As established researcher advisor best position aid postdoc
The advisor help postdoc acquire necessary skill advance determine postdoc attained skill strategize postdoc next step university research organization postdoc apply given track record date introduce postdoc colleague might prospective employer steer postdoc application interview process
In competitive job market hiring committee expect postdoc evidence independence community recognition new
Importantly common industrial head director help employee find next position industrial advisor ready postdoc alternatively postdoc find one mentor possibly advisor help
For additional guidance mentoring see
Finally important reinforce advisor must proactive thoughtful pursuing set interaction postdoc earn advisor title If advisor serve role mentor host research organization identify effective alternate several postdoc rather leaving postdoc isolated without support
With young research talent accepting postdoctoral position today ever responsibility research organization offer position ensure typically year postdoctoral experience delivers high value postdoc
Much responsibility fall individual advisor department center institution host postdoc simultaneously
As many science engineering discipline long history supporting postdoc much longer fact computer science engineering many institution particularly university today usefully extend postdoc computer science engineering
However university industrial organization hosting large number postdoc first time seriously consider responsibility develop necessary policy practice infrastructure
Additionally individual department center located within larger institution must sure take ownership issue covered measure
In past postdoc computer science predominantly hired individual advisor little involvement larger research organization call department remainder document
Nurturing postdoc almost entirely hand advisor past
But today department anecdotally reporting postdoc graduate student essential put place complementary policy practice infrastructure provide wellbeing every postdoc
First foremost department
Often happens naturally advisor invited postdoc come department intends fulfill role mentor
Regardless department responsibility check periodically pair verify advisor providing effective mentoring
The department encourage writing individual development plan postdoc discussed earlier
When becomes apparent mentoring inadequate insufficient department take action perhaps offering advisor constructive guidance situation problem persists insisting complementary additional
In case department must follow advisor postdoc regularly ensure productive worthwhile relationship manifested
The department insist periodic least year perhaps even frequently given nature postdoctoral experience advisor mentor different key collaborator
An important practice
Departments seriously consider entitlement afforded postdoc recognize provide benefit somewhere faculty graduate student
Importantly evidence different institution consider postdoc differently
For example many university allow postdoc listed principal investigator PIs grant proposal
The university may treat postdoc supported grant research advisor differently funded fellowship awarded latter may receive higher stipend coupled health benefit
These sort variance create class system among postdoc leading grievance consequence postdoctoral experience department therefore guard much possible ensuring quality consistency training program
Of particular significance computer science engineering community given long underrepresentation woman field among men woman well
The latter especially salient given postdoctoral experience often come time individual interested starting family
Departments encourage candid conversation issue advisor postdoc provide mechanism advisor postdoc pair achieve appropriate balance work continuing reasonable rate activity especially funded grant otherwise accompanied specific deadline necessary humane value preference
Similarly department offer including support cultural adaptation visa application banking tax
This may necessary foreign student previously received within Often main institution department embedded offer service assist foreign student
For situation case department ensure resource made available
Each postdoc supportive set colleague among faculty postdoc research faculty provide postdoc
The department host laboratory ensure venue may informal interaction available
There number creative way create venue intellectual interchange Besides postdoc present research least every year department colleague
At basic level postdoc introduced department included applicable list website provided informational resource others research faculty graduate student etc
department
The department provide thoughtful robust career guidance including industrial government startup position well bridging field computer science engineering substantive role play
In case career office postdoctoral office postdoctoral association might provide course counseling write curriculum vita prepare slide job interview presentation etc
The department overarching host organization provide mechanism postdoc raise concern unable adequately address advisor mentor
They receive fair hearing resolution without fear punishment retribution
Some organization purpose
Finally larger interdisciplinary institution long history postdoc established policy practice responsibility computer science engineering department ensure interest postdoc represented anytime issue come review discussion
Every field different important postdoc treated equitably experience considered whenever decision implication upon
The advisor engage conversation student
These conversation begin early continue throughout student doctoral training program student experience graduate school likely shaped aspiration
As noted previously every graduate pursue postdoctoral position advisor work student determine career path
Importantly advisor unable address student question proffer guidance work student identify additional contact source information insight
Once student elected pursue postdoctoral position advisor typically regard student intellectual descendant might wish continue vigilance behalf student accepts postdoc position position constitutes additional training opportunity
The advisor way undercut new advisor mentor
But advisor could monitor postdoc training experience provide sounding board particularly problem arise alert host department problem
After ideal advisor lifelong collaborator student
Given recent surge postdoctoral position within computer science engineering community many student postdoc advisor research organization field living postdoctoral experience first time minimum first time many versus one two postdoc department laboratory
In document attempted capture lesson field prior report define set best practice constituency effort proactively support enforce high standard element postdoctoral experience
This white paper comprehensive
Nor sought lay pro con pursuing postdoctoral position extensive detail prescriptive whether good thing field ample discussion item previous white paper
Instead borrowing heavily National Academies report strongly recommend reading white paper set serious expectation three constituency relating postdoctoral experience
The student considering postdoc position must educate postdoc think pro con accepting postdoctoral position potential site available clear understanding interest advisor host organization provide
The advisor need proactive thoughtful nurturing postdoc
We described minimum required advisor earn title mentor designation earned postdoc advisor
And host organization combination department larger institution need provide variety service postdoc
All postdoc constituency must meet expectation ensure successful postdoctoral experience everyone involved

In French use term latter seen science study treatment information
Is synonym computer science
If difference
It depends different people use word different way
Do assume particular nuance use without clarifying context
Computer science commonly described among practitioner science computation science information
While laypeople expected understand term nearly prone interpretation fix like word French due containing word
Informatics contrary usually science information often always focus social implication
The term also get use consensual meaning covering society process information
Just add confusion precise meaning branch theoretical computer science study mathematical model information quantitative perspective
common word single meaning
Nuances trend still evolving
currently give particular meaning introduction section Informatics general sense science information
As academic field involves practice information processing engineering information system
The field considers interaction human information system alongside construction computer interface
It also develops conceptual theoretical foundation utilizes foundation developed field
As field informatics great breadth encompasses many individual specialisation including particular discipline computing science
Certainly definition everything listed could considered aspect applied computer science
For example often classified bridging computer science sociology field
For example le random defines within School Computer Science representing broad spectrum CMU campus including College Humanities Social Sciences Tepper School Business College Fine Arts Carnegie Institute Technology Software Engineering Institute well School Computer The provide differing perspective word
It started translation German French cover wide range meaning including computer science information technology
Wars least flame war fought term apply concept whether X subdiscipline Y overlapping discipline etc
Tread care define term
No though much common
study information processing
This need involve computer example brain perform massive amount information processing every day
US university according cursory web search often treat informatics study intersection computing society
study mechanical computation application
On informatics page Wikipedia list computer science informatics
CS many joke field hint strictly technological study society interaction technology
Just case looking obtain equivalence qualification elsewhere may interested matching skill covered job description discipline calling
mean Informatics Portuguese term widely used Brazil derived French word Informatique junction French word Information Automatique meaning time Applied Science Technique dealing Information using Automatic Equipment computer Softwares
Here word dealing mean withdraw information computer well put information computer order process information specific goal
In sense I think Informatics much near people USA call Information Technology IT Information Communication Technology ICT
Examples Informatics application Information Management Systems Data Processing Computer Statistics VOIP Voice Internet Protocol etcetera
On hand Computer Science CiÃªncia da simply Brazilian Portuguese deal much development Mathematical Models Pure Science used Wide Variety Applications Information Data processing
These application include computer graphic drawing instance image processing Computer Tomography Astrophotography instance sound processing Voice Synthesis instance etcetera
So Informatics Computer Science related computer interact depending simply application

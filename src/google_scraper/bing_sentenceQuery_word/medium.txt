Around year ago something really exciting happening
An age old question limit knowledge collided modern mathematical one knowledge mechanized
This gave birth new field Computer Science
The science
The dream mechanizing human knowledge inspired development year ago early stage industrial revolution
Factories developed industrialist began explore mass production
Gradually machine designed replicate human But replicating human mental remained stuff dream
This began change development machine could add eventually make At first even advanced machine limited one specific task
If needed something else done build new machine
However around year ago great industrialist thinker Charles Babbage dreaming symbolic machine
One answer complex question breaking smaller question logic arithmetic together
His dream never realized driving question remained Was possible build By mathematician philosopher posing question different way
Mathematicians asked What mechanical machine capable
Philosophers asked What limitation mechanical machine
In Alan Turing bridged divide revolutionized understanding machine could
Turing outlined blueprint called A machine could answer anything
Part great insight universal machine would always reside instruction followed later known physical design hardware
Using simple language machine would run instruction imaginable
The year Turing paper young Claude Shannon completed describing clever insight telephone relay
He realized could arrange electrical switch various way perform fundamental operation logic automatically using electricity
Suddenly theoretically possible build universal computer powered electrical clock buzzed away near speed light followed instruction provide
However key question remained In decade follow computing machine grew speed operation memory capacity
Suddenly many question faced human became practical computer answer quickly
But deeper problem There seemed growing set problem given number prime machine took long question large prime
It could take thousand even million year computer give answer
Or halt
These problem solve
Think problem
And people considered drawing line sand problem easy solve problem hard solve
The attempt define division easy hard practical impractical problem lead important unsolved question computer science today
What make hard problem hard
Is result
Is perception hardness merely illusion
Will make existing hard problem easy
This question intellectual curiosity backbone internet depends set problem reach machine
But begin must step way back revisit mythology ancient
What knowledge
And mean compute Part coming soon S Brit Cruise Cameron Murray Mark Phillips various friend By clapping le signal u story really stand

Computer Science CS study principle use computer machine computation
Computer scientist deal software hardware includes theory development application design
Computer science many interesting specialization include Artificial Intelligence AI theory development computer perform task normally require human intelligence visual perception speech recognition decision making translation language
This amazing field also specialization Computer Programming make desktop apps game Computer Engineering design computer hardware Mobile Development make apps Game Design think Xbox Nintendo etc
Graphics think Toy Story Frozen Harry Potter Star Wars Data make prediction future data Databases store lot information
Is computer science
If like problem solving thing like playing puzzle game computer science definitely
Going field computer science lucrative career
Computer science listed Forbes
According computer scientist working United States made May averaged per year come per hour
The lowest paid made per year highest paid made per year
One way make career computer science get college degree computer science field study may cost per year according average cost total Carnegie Mellon University nation popular bachelor program getting computer science degree
That bad investment ask path take like going programming boot camp getting certificate learning
You take traditional route go University major Computer Science option include online class take get started computer science field would like certificate showing taken class may cost money
Companies like juggernaut online learning community
You also learn channel go specific topic Computer Science well
Let take look history behind field
A computer used known human computation majority human woman
As matter fact one first credited programmer history woman named Ada Lovelace wrote program computer
Charles best known inventor computer computer first binary programmable computer
brilliant mathematician well known lifetime
Today known conceiving modern computing helped victory World War Nazi Germany cracking unbeatable enigma machine machine Nazi Germany used send secret message back forth comrade
In short credited first computer scientist
Sadly died young age due poisoning believed suicide
Alan Turing Alonzo Church independently together introduced algorithm limit computed purely mechanical model computing
In Konrad Zuse developed world first functional program controlled computer
In created model computer architecture became known Von Neumann Architecture since model used computer design
In first computer science degree created Purdue University
Also Kenneth Iverson writes programming language
American Standard Code Information Interchange ASCII created allowed exchange data different manufacturer
I could probably write multiple article history computer science eventually people idea innovation event lead cool computer program currently like iPhone Facebook Instagram Snap Chat Tinder etc
There many algorithm used automate world
Here popular algorithm computer science curriculum
In computer science sorting algorithm algorithm put element list certain order considered one simplest sorting algorithm work repeatedly swapping adjacent element wrong order
With bubble sort algorithm able see largest element assuming sorting smallest largest top list array
Get C program GitHub sorting algorithm specifically comparison sort
The algorithm divide input list two part sublist item already sorted built left right front left list sublist item remaining sorted occupy rest list
Initially sorted sublist empty unsorted sublist entire input list
The algorithm proceeds finding smallest largest depending sorting order element unsorted sublist exchanging swapping leftmost unsorted element putting sorted order moving sublist boundary one element right
Get code selection sort GitHub also commonly spelled mergesort efficient sorting algorithm
Most implementation produce stable sort mean implementation preserve input order equal element sorted output
Merge sort divide conquer algorithm invented John von Neumann
Divide unsorted list n sublists containing element list element considered sorted
Repeatedly merge sublists produce new sorted sublists sublist remaining
This sorted list
Binary search one fundamental algorithm computer science
also known find position target value within
Binary search compare target value middle element array unequal half target lie eliminated search continues remaining half successful
If search end remaining half empty target array
Linear Search method finding specific element value list
It check every element sequentially find specific element value
algorithm traverse tree graph data structure
It start root go far possible along branch backtracking
graph search algorithm solves single source shortest path problem graph edge path cost producing shortest path tree
This created
In computer science data structure particular way storing organizing data computer used efficiently
list element
It variable special data structure hold many value type
For example array integer would look like image
A data structure computer science special tree satisfies heap property mean parent le equal child node minimum heap parent greater equal child node maximum heap
A pair set denoted V E
The edge connect pair vertex
Each vertex represented node
Trees special type graph loop self loop circuit
A tree node connected similar graph
It root subtrees consisting child parent node
So basically heap special tree special graph data structure

Whatever piece art made medium
The plural medium
So one piece art made one medium several medium
If ever art museum gallery probably seen little sign next piece look something like Canvas Wood Silk All item medium
They describe item artist used make art
Therefore oil canvas medium used describe particular work
Sometimes important part piece art interpreted
Different material carry different significance
For example certain wood considered sacred using indicates piece art special artist us uncommon medium say garbage help artist make statement
process painting pigment held together type oil dry exposed air called drying oil
When oil mixed powdered pigment creates color paint
Different pigment create different color
Since prehistoric time natural pigment mineral shell used
After industrial revolution people able create new color using machine could create synthetic pigment
The first artist use oil base paint Indian Chinese Buddhists working Afghanistan early fifth century
By century painter Netherlands began using oil painting soon took popular medium Europe Italian Renaissance
Since oil paint common medium Western art
Oil paint almost always used paint canvas woven fabric
another common medium
Before oil painting became popular painting done tempera paint
Rather oil pigment held together sticky material commonly egg yolk
Egg yolk hold pigment together dry fast sometimes give paint slightly yellow color
Nevertheless common way make paint oil came around still used many artist enjoy working paint create certain effect
Tempera often used paint wood another common medium Italian Renaissance
In sculpture one common medium
Marble soft stone easy sculptor carve chip polish smooth beautiful work art
Small impurity white marble give sculpture unique color shine
The Italian artist Michelangelo Buonarroti one famous sculptor time famous saying could see image block marble job remove excess
Get FREE access day create account
another common medium sculpture
Since expensive bronze sculpture used rich display power wealth
Unlike marble bronze carved
It meaning sculpture first carved cheaper material wax mold created around
The bronze poured mold cooled
Artists either cast sculpture one large piece several smaller piece assembled larger sculpture
Artists use sort medium want help give work certain feel texture significance
Several common medium include glass metal concrete chalk sand watercolor fabric plaster
Other le common medium include spray paint animation software film light sound even human body tattoo performance art
Art mean painting sculpture anything created artistic purpose medium
A refers material used create work art
The plural medium medium
Some common medium paint use oil hold pigment together pigment held together egg yolk soft white stone metal used cast sculpture
Artists often use particular medium affect texture color work art
Other time artist choose medium help audience interpret art specific way
Purple pigment expensive used royalty
Sage sacred many culture used ceremonial art
Spray paint used create message especially used graffiti
To understand work art audience understand medium mean

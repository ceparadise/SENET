When transitioning traditional methodology none Agile one big hurdle get story point
Many team I worked struggle concept point first difficult time deemphasizing development hour estimate
Once team see ease value point transition much easier
The following question seem high people list Story point arbitrary scale applied user story define relative size complexity story compared story
Story point used conjunction team planning execution utilize past performance velocity guide planning future
Relative project scale number iteration complete work item give equivalent traditional timeline progress measurement
Story Points ARE Story Points ARE NOT I provide example show concept story point applied painting room house
In following example team want paint room house
The point estimation process started picking room bedroom assigning reference point value
From team reviewed room painted compared relative size reference room
If room size reference room estimated next scale
If room bigger team estimated next scale
The remaining room estimated based reference previous estimate house fully estimated
The total story point project scope
Notice include information experience level painter number painter per room
Complexity factored hall number doorway kitchen complexity painting around appliance
We simply estimated relative size complexity room compared others determine total scope
Next apply team velocity point determine complete work
In case team earn scope per iteration timeline four iteration
Velocity determined past performance
If first house paint team would make educated guess velocity
My feeling point better estimated hour different simpler universal
So better
Story point abstract scope development effort giving everyone team chance participate understand size complexity software product development
Here reason
Story point introduced planning iteration release
They locked committed story iteration planning meeting
Story point earned story accepted business
This mean team design develops accepts package story deployment
The Scrum Master us earned point generate team velocity trend
Velocity key planning future effort
Product manager use point along velocity guess future project timeline using burn chart show number expected iteration take order deliver set story
This would difficult impossible utilizing development hour everything would need understood detailed level broken development QA task estimated graphed project timeline considering resource
This healthy debate
My opinion generally NO
Hours helpful Beyond team done away estimated hour measure anything
I use velocity determine number story point team might earn iteration use guide team selecting story commit
When close capacity I go around room ask people feel workload confidence selected story far
If team feel light commit story
The short answer NO
There correlation story point hour never
I always discourage anyone trying find connection
That said way use point participation trend anyway developer determine percent time spend category time
For example I worked company back wanted know amount time developer spent developing product line previous month
By adding total point participated member product line dividing total point earned member percentage derived
Multiply percent total developer hour given month show approximate hour spent toward product line
Is accurate
Not really thing equal provide really reasonable estimate short amount time
Because hour vary every story work best longer timeframes average estimate From Yours first article I read subject clearly explained relate story point
Estimating effort time anathema agile practitioner still necessity manager

When estimating relative size user story agile software development member team supposed estimate size user story
So estimated value resemble Fibonacci series
But I wonder
The description Wikipedia hold mysterious sentence The reason using Fibonacci sequence reflect inherent uncertainty estimating larger item
But inherent uncertainty larger item
Is uncertainty higher make fewer measurement meaning fewer people estimate story
And even uncertainty higher larger story imply use Fibonacci sequence
Is mathematical statistical reason
Otherwise using Fibonacci series estimation feel like CargoCult science
The Fibonacci series one example exponential estimation scale
The reason exponential scale used come Information Theory
This reason higher uncertainty larger item
Determining optimal base exponential scale normalization difficult practise
The base corresponding Fibonacci scale may may optimal
Here detailed explanation mathematical justification Out first six number Fibonacci sequence four prime
This limit possibility break task equally smaller task multiple people work parallel
Doing could lead misconception speed task could scale proportionally number people working
The series vulnerable problem
The Fibonacci sequence fact force one smaller task one one
According grow rate human perceive meaningful change magnitude
Yeah right
I think add air legitimacy Fibonacci
math
essence sizing scoping exercise value
But get result using sizing You definitely want something exponential express quantity time constant relative error
The precision estimation well likely proportional estimation
So want something integer b exponential c easy Now Fibonacci instead
My guess fibonacci grows slower
It
The Fibonacci sequence one several used project planning poker
It difficult accurately estimate large unit work easy get bogged hour v day discussion number realistic
I like explanation namely Fibonacci series represents set number intuitively distinguish different magnitude
I use Fibonacci couple reason As add uncertainty le sure hour actually
It end easier gauge task another one gave estimate already
As task effect uncertainty also amplified
I would happily taking estimate hour task seems twice large one I previously estimated hour

Story point give accurate estimate drastically reduce planning time accurately predict release date help team improve performance
Hours give worse estimate introduce large amount waste system handicap Product Owner release planning confuse team process improvement really worked
Microsoft Estimation Strategy Traditional Estimation Strategy Interesting new research become available
The Standish Group updated finding project success rate based analysis last decade data ten thousand data point
In addition Microsoft new research finding showing agile estimation astoundingly accurate traditional project estimation
See Laurie Williams Gabe Brown Adam Meltzer Nachiappan Nagappan IEEE Best Industry Paper award winner Many people managed project hour hard time understanding story point better
They failed understand fundamental data published year industry literature well latest research
First let look latest data project failure
Failure rate increasing IT project current disruption global financial system
The latest Standish group analysis show agile project three time success rate traditional project
Jim Johnson recommends agile practice used universally project
In fact latest Forrester Group research show The venture capitalist I work say never seen correct GANTT chart board meeting
When dig problem say none management team knew velocity team implemented Scrum
Not knowing velocity production team root cause failure release plan accurate board meeting
The stability user story critical planning
A three point story today three point next year measurable part product release Product Owner
The hour story depend day person
This change every day
The GANTT chart assumes fixed number hour fictitious person often person implement assumes fixed dependency always changing
A study multimillion dollar project GSI Commerce owned eBay showed best expert company totally incapable estimating much time project would take people actually implemented
You would think data would cause people change behavior many company seem prefer continue fail acquired go bankrupt rather improve project management technique
Rand Corporation research showed clearly human good estimating hour practical experience repeatedly confirms research
The recommended Delphi approach estimation adopted software development technique
The technique embedded practice called Planning Poker agile team
The management metric project delivery need unit production
Production precondition revenue company say business grow revenue margin even though project planning often opposite
At least venture capital group clear money money come velocity production combined quality product
Hours expense reduced eliminated whenever possible
The best data individual developer performance come Yale University reported previously blog
The best developer project take one hour complete task worst developer take hour within project hour across project
For team difference order magnitude greater
Larry Putnam published data show hour productive team turn hour least productive team
Hours completed tell Product Owner nothing many feature ship ship
The important metric number story point team deliver per unit calendar time
The point per sprint velocity
Therefore estimate everything point Product Owner create release roadmap based team velocity adjust plan velocity change
The way story point estimation give better estimate hourly estimate accurate le variation
A CMMI Level company determined story point estimation cut estimation time allowing team estimation tracking typical waterfall team
A telecom company noticed estimated story point planning poker time faster waterfall estimation practice company gave good better estimate
Story point therefore faster better cheaper hour highest performing team completely abandon hourly estimation view waste slows
For complete break point hour debate see Scrum topic
Hi Jeff I get bit say The metric importan ce number story point
Sorry story point way disguising planned workhours estimated workhours prefer
We known nearly three decade measure output software ie
quantity functionality required delivered
aka amount information processing
You may like functional size measurement
It Allan Albrecht invented Function Points back
The need measure output software process changed little since
However nowadays COSMIC FSM Method provides mean measure output functionality big improvement old FPA method
Ref www dot cosmicon dot com COSMIC easily integrates user story using Data Movement Sequence Diagrams help visualise user functional requirement
This visualisation boon also contributes communication user developer product owner
If like discus I happy hear
Best regard Grant PG Rule SMSexemplar dot com Story Points Planned Workhours
Hourly based estimate would change team improves skill productivity
Story Points remain consistent defined relative reference story
As ScrumInc video Story Points measure OUTPUT Time measure INPUT
Very different thing
Just stumbled upon thread
If define story point measure scope effort planned I think Jeff right
I like emphasize definition use encourage team thing like analysis story QA story sprint backlog yes item require effort hour deliver nothing direct value user
Velocity production rate payroll cost expended
Hello I new Agile started new sprint last weak
I QA story point estimation last weak
My question I totally confused story point estimation v hour log
Can explain detail EX Suppose story point user story
How many hour equal many hour I log
Thanks Venkat Hi Venkat Teams working story point use story point estimation planning sprint
We recommend logging hour suggest company work purely story point
Logging hour slows team
However must log hour log many hour actually work regardless story point estimate
Best Alex I agree Function Points appropriate metric comparison across team technology
A CMMI Leve company I research spent two year trying implement COSMIC function point still feel like working properly
Agile team neither time need
Story point effective team based metric
The interesting data acceleration velocity provide baseline accelarate
Grant Sorry story point way disguising planned workhours estimated workhours You suggesting sory point something real like time unit
But represent relative measurement
And direct relationship hour compensate variance work
That another reason work better absolute unit time There direct relationship hour
Let say teem people burn story point one sprint let say sprint week long
Assume person hour working day
So relationship week working day day people hour man hour story point one sprint story point per man hour
As long sprint expressed time estimation hour
Otherwise always relationship
IMO important thing really understand across organization estimation
Your model appears appealing logic lot compounded poor assumption clearly stated
Let say Clearly stated assumption also flawed
New team idea productive assumption reasonably applied
Even dedicated team member get hour actual productive work eight hour day
OMB specifies hour productive work per hour cycle
Statistical study support
Even team exactly velocity every Sprint
Life chaotic Holidays vacation Sickness natural disaster team conposition change technoloty change affect team capacity
Even average point given sprint may range value
Each person concept much hour wildly variant almost always wrong variety logical psychological reason
Yes formula like CAN shown work team time always le accurate true relative estimation
We adopted another variant Story Point refer Complexity Point CP
This way used reflect relative complexity cost implementing various feature application framework
Our basis CP estimate Ideal Developer Day
hour focussed work per day
Further normalized skill level various developer within team
For developer relevant experience application framework technology hour task pegged CP estimate
Further velocity measure Actual Developer Days consumed per CP estimate
We peg Actual Developer Days per CP
Different team velocity ranging
The velocity team basis capacity calculation per sprint
The plan level indicates available capacity specific team velocity
During execution focus retaining plan level trying improve velocity
The predicatability approach around
team make thier plan level
In case CP planning tool
By working proper velocity per team based thier history predictable plan level achieved
The fundamental point blog item relating hour story point cause huge impediment team
If team generating continuous process improvement hour per story point continually decreasing
Assuming number hour per story point make impossible team show improved fix mind reasonable number hour per story point
The reasonable amount hour story point zero developer constantly trying get
For highest performing team I worked reduced hour per story point one reduced minute
For I say minute
How know decrease story point actually increase productivity
It might well inflation estimate
Especially team measured velocity
As Goldratt put If tell measure I tell I behave My venture company typically two stable reference story point
It easy see story fit
The Product Owner help keep people honest estimation
The problem team inflating estimate
As go faster estimate similar story fewer point unless careful stable reference story
For know going twice fast velocity change
This impediment tell process improvement helped
For team lie estimate fudge number generally hire startup get rid produce
I think reference story help
Could share
Also project progress dependency increase cost change time implement usually increase
This XP focus lot refactoring
This may mean reference story reevaluated new one might written reflect current right
Or handle
Also I liked following solution opting using hour He mention
Using would also help team know removing impediment right
Or see benefit story point solution
For highest performing team I worked reduced hour per story point one reduced minute
For I say minute That sound implausible unless course effect team going beginner proficient tool platform use
So big story point team increase productivity order magnitude
Very little posting support thesis
Most interesting irrelevant question story point versus hour
Story point hour must convertible different exchange rate per team presumably varying time since actual amount work either way
Which unit one chooses change people use time change pace work change amount time available work affect fact work temporal activity
Hence explanation better result using story point indeed better common human bias thinking hour specifically
That ALL debate legitimately yet nothing apology story point address
The support blog posting claim telecom firm found estimation faster using story point hour
But really happened
Did use poker game estimating hour
Did use set bucket estimating hour
Or change well
If switch story point say nothing reliable
Until someone conduct reasonably study story point versus hour allowed vary matter remains one ideology superstition
I finished Scrum metric presentation Agile people thought best conference
It showed importance story point fixing reference
Eight metric presented six comparable across team
Actual team data presented showing team going initial velocity
We already similar data half dozen team collecting
Let reiterate one
Those hour problem
They know velocity project plan wrong according investor board OpenView Venture Partners portfolio company

Because know velocity show clear demonstration improved performance management

Without good velocity measurement implement performance improvement know really worked
Hours extremely bad practice abandoned
I even teach hour Scrum training I find team get confused find difficult execute Scrum well
An finally hour introduce extra waste team
It take lot time estimate
They accurate story point
And team using hour tend improve fast using point

That measured velocity using hour
The blog posting also make statement The best developer project take one hour complete task worst developer take hour somehow change one measure story point instead
It
It non sequitur
While may true support thesis way
This I state blog posting support thesis
It lot stuff favor whole scrum package nothing actually demonstrates importance story point specifically
It certainly address curiosity story point hour
If thesis velocity quantity production per unit time therefore must ass quantity production independently time question What unit quantity production You many answer
We equate unit production number line code story point dollar value story point number fan letter accrued developer
No
We conduct sprint fixed duration scrum team refines estimation ability number story point completed sprint expected settle something constant
Therefore quantity production amount time take
That surprise estimate story point estimate large task compared task
Large much time take nothing else
Story point
Hours
It thing nothing blog posting demonstrates otherwise
You need psychological study showing brain squirm incompetence mention hour order make case story point
One time
Story point based reference story unit measure product owner understands
Hours work release planning
That project worldwide fail
The reference independent team skill knowledge capability
There sufficient research academic literature demonstrate practical experience show thing try
Jeff I agree thought story point product backlog
Do teach team still estimate sprint backlog task hour burndown chart
Steve I member Scrum Foundation teach estimation three way

Backlog story point tasking hyperproductive team
Backlog story point task story point best current practice team getting better
Backlog story point task hour old way The latest version Scrum Guide say work broken piece day le
Hyperproductive team know probability story completed successfully based size point act accordance data
I consulted product owner hyperproductive team say estimate point product backlog item
Sometimes tasking never estimate task
This almost always show story small enough clear enough best practice hyperproductive team small story task
For enabling specification team using epic brief description large story spawn many smaller story executable
It critical hyperproductive team higher level view single story
Thanks provided detail three way estimate
Creating hourly estimate sprint task felt like form work progress I going Scrum team start estimate task story point
So I get point Story Points equate Hours
My company pursuing heavily SCRUM
However I still provide reporting estimate project tracking respository Effort Months hour per month per person
So point despite utilizing Agile process I convert Story Points hourly overall estimate also report hour spent given project
This seems like I asked indicate done
Am I missing something
If management asks report slow people good management
If provide report make question competency management
Maybe look company competent management
General Motors went bankrupt
Have every analyzed
What Toyota measure measure
Jeff I follow question related hyperproductive team
Backlog story point tasking hyperproductive team So tasking user story small typical developer select user story work complete story
Each developer case would skill deliver completed user story
Thanks Steve When story small one developer often complete
However pairing usually help least half case
Jeff Teams task story estimate task develop Burn chart
Also see practical one developer complete story somebody test well reason might need involvement another developer
We used Hours estimation task used show Vertical axis time
Hi Jeff first I apologize comment came bit late
It article written early

Backlog story point tasking hyperproductive team
Backlog story point task story point best current practice team getting better
Backlog story point task hour old way I intend bring team hyperproductive state
Can advice I sum remaining work I elevate practice eventually
For practice tough imagine head
If story point worth I split task
If story perhaps point task
Possibly one task assigned another colleague
But practice I really appreciate advice
Teams estimate story point
As story get smaller longer need tasking
Multiple people work story
The fastest team tend get small story size count number story done burndown
I seen one study show counting number story gave result estimating
Of course story near good one small achieve
A hyper productive team use tasking story small
When say small story meant based stable reference story
As opposed hyper productive team estimating story superb performance
Stories independent time
Faster team get point per time
By small story I mean story average day le team
So performance improves able take larger story
However case Scrum story stable point year team improved
At beginning year point took couple hour
By end year averaging minute
So team tend take larger story sprint consistently broke story could executed quickly dependency
Just confirm understanding
I would like use sample story sale quotation software
A Big As sale manager manage inventory item team make quotation System administrator assign privilege user group control access sale function B Small As sale manager delete inventory item item used sale quotation As salesman privilege view quotation screen edit C Small Code connection connect SQL Server Express Create xml document When say small story team mean refining Part A something like Part B estimation
You mean story Part A eventually worded like Part C hyper productive team
Part C story
They technical task user value statement
These small story
Part B larger story broken user point view
So increasingly productive team user story look increasingly like Part B
One year user story like Part A
Please correct I wrong
For hyper productive Scrum team skill groom story INVEST criterion important learning technique estimate accurate hour
In fact technique estimate hour irrelevant
For hyperproductive team hour irrelevant
They good breaking story smaller story
Stories tend small size counting story good estimating point
Jeff If small story trace working code production
For large story functionality production functionality
When hyperproductive team work small story difference product owner decide feature release
We talking high performing team many concern longer applicable team
What velocity team much improved time
At last company I CTO released end every sprint
The Product Owner decided turn visible customer
All code progress always production build verify would break anything even feature partially complete
This enterprise software installed within hospital server farm
For web application company today going continuous deployment multiple time day
In reality I want privilege join team
While waiting I trying imagine team
I imagine story small like thread
Threads weaved together form piece cloth
Following analogy thread functionality appear user surprised appearance
But also said The Product Owner decided turn This team hyper productive technical ability masterful
The problem team know velocity know story point day work business hour story point hour
Lol
Story point hour thing
Just mental trickery trying play
The key thing point hour try get people think relatively saying task take amount time task
Playing game word seems kind arrogant frankly
While point time team burning certain number point per hour goal constantly increase point per hour least per sprint team implementing Scrumming Scrum pattern
Furthermore recent paper Microsoft show estimation error order point hour early stage project
Please read research Delphi method RAND corporation told DOD use hour
If believe research nothing help
I like read report reference
The one read use hour please
Since report referenced blog post I heard Microsoft stopped using hour estimation even legacy waterfall project
They use point

Scrum Engineering Practices Experiences Three Microsoft Teams Laurie Williams Gabe Brown Adam Meltzer Nachiappan Nagappan IEEE Best Industry Paper award winner Hi Jeff If team burning story point per hour sprint mean velocity increase sprint
Do commit sprint previous one
Thank Claudia I use yesterday weather standard practice Scrum team
This play pattern discovered OpenView Venture Partners
Teams tend finish early accelerate faster
It acceleration velocity
Continuous improvement fundamental
A flat lined team living Happy The Scrum Patterns Group working pattern
The ScrumMaster need pop happy bubble
Hi Jeff We robust discussion scrum team calculating velocity
As normal new team couple story failed
We taken next sprint
Now velocity based left finish
An example pointer complete
If take point next sprint finish early like point bank
If would come three pointer
Now important working velocity estimate finish date project
If take point I feel get fairer indication true velocity averaged three sprint artificial acceleration sprint
Is right wrong way
Cheers Cain You count none point incomplete story towards point total Sprint A
Count Sprint B story complete
It might seem draconian velocity per sprint important average multiple sprint
This tends flatten peak valley get fail complete story take next sprint
We trialled story point hour numerous project settled point
Hours tended encouragement manager ask estimate match actual time never match exactly course
Story point neat abstraction although estimation purpose use story point half day least gut feel budget large enough
developer think term half day estimating
We trialled story point hour numerous project settled point
Hours tended encouragement manager ask estimate match actual time never match exactly course
Story point neat abstraction although estimation purpose use story point half day least gut feel budget large enough
developer think term half day estimating
Hi Jeff good article
We trialled story point ideal hour project best result bit hybrid
Most work fixed price need know outset long full project delivery estimated take use exchange rate story point half day
Most developer especially worked agile project tend think term day anyway estimate even reference story refer
This exchange rate help u work cost client
But project begin deal story point way resist attempt manager refer back original association progress measured using story point burn chart
Jeff I able find Microsoft Research article referred would interested reading
Could please provide title better yet link
Thank
Scrum Engineering Practices Experiences Three Microsoft Teams see blog item link Laurie Williams Gabe Brown Adam Meltzer Nachiappan Nagappan IEEE Best Industry Paper award winner Jeff I afraid I agree point Daniel made
I think reading said carefully enough
A quick example
I identical team working let say hour week
Team A work hour Team B story point
There task one big task equally smaller task
Team A estimate get task done hour task hour task hour
Team B estimate story point task piece task
They complete work time
hour team A story point Team B
Do see going
The difference relative factor factor
A total hour story point mean story point equivalent hour work sprint workload taken account
The two measure exact thing
It number end developer estimated therefore related
Now I believe story point better thing computing relative tends cause le problem absolute denying end day choosing hour story point make project fail use story point
It process around make break software project
At point time relationship point hour
However constantly changing team get better
Hyperproductive team abandon notion hour slows
I seen exception
Interesting though controversial article
I forced agree Daniel though
Ultimately conversion factor get developed story point hour
And say possible velocity always increasing make sense
There much process improvement one achieve software development team level still preserving modicum balance well
Granted new tool technique come fore periodically provide sustained boost productivity basis
IMHO implementing numerous project way introduce relativity hour estimation technique make flexible use weighted average story task
So Story A developer might say optimistically take hour expected time hour pessimistic time average hour
You compute weighted average using formula
In case glean developer seem pretty good feel long task take weighted average come equal expected value hour
But Story B developer come Opt Exp Pess
This tell u uncertainty associated task reflected resulting weighted average hour greater expected value
Curious thought
At given point time direct relationship point hour change like time drive work change every day depending fast go
We know average peak velocity great team function point per developer per month
I think anyone posting list reached state worry
Just know velocity increase make process improvement
Great team always think stretch thinking clear sign disfunction
When Toyota Japanese management visited first Toyota plant running six month saw team shut line often enough fix problem
The senior Japanese manager went andor cord pulled stopping entire production line
Gathering worker together gave lecture No Problem Problem
Hi Jeff I took CSM course July Boston
I work towards creating small user story I need break task
But already backlog estimated term story point
Now I trying estimate task term story point
Should total task story point equal estimated story point user story
Because I divide story point task take smallest task relative estimation point total task story point differing estimated story point user story
Hi Jeff I must I still coach team story point estimating user story hour estimating task
The process worked well team really helped understand see committing sprint planning session
It also helped team understand estimate estimate written stone
For team new Scrum I think hour story point eas transition Scrum
Although practiced team I suggest move away hour practice keep everything based upon point an see think
Paul Hi Jeff I PM ScrumMaster small team people choose use Story Points User Stories ideal hour Technical Tasks belong User Story
For u admit cumbersome work two unit developer tend use story point ideal day work
I keep saying way
I also see logging time going well expected
The reason use ideal hour technical task want track burndown sprint working
As read article see suggest use story point everything suggest need ideal hour
I would like try see problem like
I small team mean would need lot User Stories Sprint actually useable sprint burndown chart

Because need split User Stories small hard convince developer since must end end functionality brings something useful customer
I know others know book saying
The reality big difference book imo

Books say keep story independent go split feature day User Stories becoming VERY hard impossible dependency people solve problem
I see problem team User Stories larger day work
I imagine happen went day work User Story

User Stories must written Product Owner teach product owner able split User Stories smaller one abstract fact user story alone give value customer without also implementing User Story A B etc
At ScrumInc started team seven
Two people half time FTE equivalent
Our velocity varies sprint sprint run point increasing
The average story size point story sprint
We product owner ScrumMaster trying Product Owner cause problem
Our team member help product owner lot writing story
When started point needed story sprint third size need story sprint go faster need story sprint
You long list question I going answer detail
I still understand mean part Hours completed tell Product Owner nothing many feature ship ship If week working hour per person mean week Sprint would working hour per person
If feature take hour complete Product Owner also know get feature
I still understand mean part Hours completed tell Product Owner nothing many feature ship ship If week working hour per person mean week Sprint would working hour per person
If feature take hour complete Product Owner also know get feature
I still understand mean part Hours completed tell Product Owner nothing many feature ship ship If week working hour per person mean week Sprint would working hour per person
If feature take hour complete Product Owner also know get feature
The Product Owner owner know complete point hour unless know velocity team
The point get Product Owner velocity
Velocity measure unit feature delivered
Over people Scrum know velocity give reliable release date
This huge impediment cripple continuous improvement make impossible go hyperproductive
It also lead serious negative side effect observe company assessment Scrum implementation
In particular facilitates manager micromanaging employee derails
Hello Jeff Your post great
I translated french Regards Fabrice Grant PG Rule Sorry argument FPs always keep coming back anyone talk SPs
I developed thought around
All confusing SPs time Mike Cohn explained eloquently several time
SPs measure effort time
I run Usain Bolt le second
SPs like
Jeff Thanks valuing SPs
There even interesting way using SPs especially connecting financial estimate thereof
See chapter Agility Across Time Space Implementing Agile Methods Global Software Projects Springer
It would interesting hear opinion
I totally get difference story point hour big psychological difference estimating using one rather
However measure sprint efficiency every sprint track moving average
In sprint finished Friday previous sprint although month moving average remains
We asked cost change request course hourly rate card
We estimated story point used allowance budgetary purpose
I believe I anything wrong using sprint efficiency convert story point estimate man hour estimate costing purpose
Did I
At point time divide sprint velocity hour sprint get current hour per point
However change time based team performance
In paper published distributed Scrum hour per point went half team moved back India Indian half team started assigning task stopped
When fixed hour per point went back
Later team started working overtime always cause defect fixing drive hour per point
Ideally hour per point going sprint sprint implementing pattern Scrumming See
I love discussion
It highlight I believe primary culprit estimation discussion
IMHO long continue use work estimate people bring traditional mindset attempt use hour day week etc
story point discussion
As Jeff point schedule functionality I term scope
This I strongly advocate dropping work completely Agile lexicon go term size
Why
Size refers functionality scope estimate typically aligned schedule
So effect measuring two different thing
You read blog article Cheers
For problem hour happens I finish early happens rarely happens
If I estimated hour took I think I got hour spare time break estimate point I finished early I likely pick next work item giving team productivity boost
As side effect I suffer student syndrome wherein I wait last minute start working next story
In experience fundamental flaw using either point ideal hour work best project tends contextual team
A big problem point team reference story quickly loses value
If story encapsulating entire piece business functionality requires input IA designer developer set people trying compare reference may varying degree input required per person

If reference story build sitemap website may trivial designer quite complex IA whereas website footer may require almost effort developer IA several day work designer
You end distinct point reference story point mean total point story meaningless
Another problem point useful project planning practically impossible completed least one sprint know velocity anything else pure guess work
And thing planning people tend want plan ahead time want relate time money
That called plan
Estimating hour also problem Jeff said team pick momentum tend get productive
Some gain hidden estimating hour people naturally adjust expectation effort know tend go rate efficiency go leading levelling recorded velocity
This affect story point done properly key
Based experience lesser two evil use hour least map point hour
The vast majority business need plan need advance need metric plan
Hour estimate flaw workable easily explained people practice business sponsor tend care much velocity see work completed reasonable pace
Points may work well continuous ongoing work fairly homogeneous support desk instance project involving multiple discipline especially project covering new ground much harder use effectively
And lastly saying Maybe look company competent management effectively admitting approach useless many business arrogant extreme
If response Please help plan project say I support way planning also admission failure
You may able pick choose company work based management style people luxury
Asserting agile doctrine important established business planning essentially saying definition tail wagging dog
Whatever happened Individuals interaction process tool
What wrong function point
Why need new metric sizing project
IMHO story point technique digest FP limited use restriced team
Using FP easy using SP learn use good ROI
My simple rule estimating
Avoid wasting time decomposing work increase accuracy
Take whatever unit measurement prefer ie
story point hour
Be consistent estimate Next execute next project compare baseline estimate actuals
Finally use great equalizer convert estimate whatever unit measurement actual In Waterfall Cost Performance Index CPI Schedule Performance Index SPI part Earned Value Management EVM In Agile wheel called Velocity
Hi Jeff measure budget based story point since work based hour
Hi Jeff estimate budget using story point since resource cost based
Budgeting point faster easier accurate hour
Once number point per sprint team know cost team sprint
A product release take specific number team sprint based product backlog
Systematic CMMI Level company almost fixed price project Scrum
They estimate front cost submitting waterfall proposal consistently deliver half waterfall price fewer defect
Go link right side blog Jeff Sutherland Papers download Scrum CMMI paper get idea
While I believer story point estimation I wanted point reference provide evidence point better hour The team used Planning Poker estimate person hour required complete functionality within The article posit estimating small story using planning poker effective process explicit fact team used hour point
I see article referenced lot respect point estimation lot good evidence SCRUM effective support argument using story point hour
You reference literature describes effectiveness point hour
Can share
Hi Jeff I would like ask two thing said
In article one response I recently started thread Scrum Practitioners LinkedIn group see I asked following I suggested size increase team velocity would reflect fact technology increased
Then I thought velocity figure
Is measure team performance case increase time
Or something like remain stable PO stakeholder use forecast release date amongst thing Until coming across article mind settled latter
In fact even reading article mind changed although I beginning doubt conclusion
Are able expand said I better understand
Thanks
The whole point velocity see increase team story faster
Reference story must stable achieve
If stable reference velocity meaningless
All historical data becomes worthless
You tell team getting better tell process improvement increased decreased velocity
I tend agree Daniel post
I also think directly associate fact project worldwide fail use measurement unit hour
I would say primary reason staggering failure rate due communication problem introducing confusion unit measure whether story point hour contributes communication problem
Love Scrum using successfully year see failure rate expect based upon content blog posting

Good point
Actually waterfall project worldwide fail hour although hour give much worse estimate contribute high failure rate
Let reiterate error rate hourly estimate much higher point take hour estimate something using hour estimated minute point
So better estimate time le effort required point continue insist hour hope convincing anything
Hi Jeff one small best practice used initiation point project
example company starting new project management entitled get initial estimate whole project first determined SCRUM Team start
Hello Jeff Would say important estimate team set reference story made time
Why
Apologies answer obvious well known
Thanks
Comments couple good question

Estimating fix price project estimate front commonly required
You create proper product backlog estimate
Stories close small story large chunk
Systematic CMMI company almost fixed price project data show strategy eliminates total project management cost project giving good better estimate

Estimates estimate team get story done individual reference story need stable time
We review reference story every quarter make sure stable
A liter water liter today liter tomorrow matter fast drink
To plan need velocity based stable reference
Hey Jeff
I completely agree value added estimating Story Points
With historical data past give high degree confidence amount SP team produce Sprint
I started estimate SP using th Fibonaccy Series team felt confortable estimating hour task drilled deep I question
We use smallest story ruler Story Points
So far good
But start facing big value like human struggle properly compare
Do believe OK double check estimation another story size moment ago
Imagine team estimate Story SP Story SP Story As sanity check valid question Story SP size accually little bit le work Story
Is question changing Story Points referential instead compare piece work
I glad I found post
It made think maybe I hate Scrum I hate way company implement
However still uphill battle convincing management use point instead hour
Any suggestion finding another job
I even teach hour Scrum So extremely bad practice abandoned used teach
Why
Also I see anything Scrum guide saying hour could used
How I tell management wrong
I one company fighting point hour ammunition I opinion blog post
Really
A three point story today three point next year measurable part product release Product Owner I say hour A three hour story today three hour next year measurable part product release Product Owner And accurate statement story point relative hour
hour year minute hour next year minute
Task A year point Task A next year N point
Not valid argument
However nice post
You misunderstood comment
Let clarify
A point story always three point agree reference like pint beer one pint beer today tomorrow
How fast drink beer depends person whether practising pub
How long drink pint depends persona change every time ask question
A back fun measuring velocity Hoffbrauhaus using point pint
Hours unstable Rand Corporation scientist recommended strongly high error rate high variance decade ago
Points far accurate timss faster estimate based benchmark large telecom company
You read IEEE award winning Microsoft paper blog post essentially repeated Rand Corporation research
Learned lot science Xebia Scrum Master course
I remember saying prefer average vote
Is correct
I base point estimate science popular opinion I doctoral degree statistic
The maximum likelihood estimate expert opinion distribution average
For Fibonnaci quite average close
Taking Fibonacci number estimate mathematically provably wrong I use technique
It matter preference
From mathematical point view provably best estimate maximum likelihood set expert opinion number average probability distribution
So statistic book say I think

Stories statistic
We following continuing conversation among journalist programmer educator education United States whether everyone code
It question come often circle pleased read thoughtful nuanced conversation last week Tasneem Raja interactive editor In one statistic particular caught eye The United States graduated proportionally fewer major
Could really
We live age techology company growing exponential rate case order retain best people
So looked
It true percentage bachelor degree awarded computer science percent total significantly higher percentage percent
But focusing single difference miss far interesting story
Take look chart showing proportion bachelor master degree
Aside looking remarkably like Cisco representation San Francisco iconic Golden Gate Bridge chart clearly show fluctuation interest among undergraduate graduate computer science
The reason fluctuation clear graph couple theory In many elementary middle high school taught computer programming student according Joanna Goode
As associate professor education study University Oregon Goode researched access woman student color computer science
But PC revolution took place introduction prepackaged software Internet changed typical school curriculum programming approach computer literacy course use computer Goode wrote email
That could explain rise degree early would grade school drop student elementary school learned use computer program one
Fluctuations attainment often connected fluctuation job market certain industry
The peak degree came four year introduction IBM heyday Apple II likely led increased interest getting degree
Similarly second wave early came four year development bubble Silicon Valley job IPOs seemed almost ubiquitous
The subsequent decline major followed bursting bubble
In either case data seem indicate midst another rise interest computer science college level
Whether result better education lower grade level increased interest related ubiquity smartphones boom say unclear
Furthermore focus major miss larger point
As Raja argues essay simply teaching kid code goal
Just perhaps teaching kid think like computer called computational She highlight current effort teach computational thinking elementary secondary school particularly girl member minority group remain woefully underrepresented among professional computer programmer
And teaching computational thinking may result degree important contribution make giving people across field ability solve problem like computer scientist speak language computer programming
As Raja note skill everyone access regardless major

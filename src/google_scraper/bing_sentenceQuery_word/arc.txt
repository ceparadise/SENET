A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

Precisely speaking difference graph term vertex node edge arc
I read node arc used graph strictly tree
If precise rule protocol please cite reference
The distinction vertex node seems mostly discipline
whether come combinatorics computer science irrelevant
The distinction edge arc sometimes relevant depending using combinatorialists sometimes use edge mean undirected edge arc mean directed edge although usage universal
You take look Introduction Graph Theory Douglas B
West
At page Second Edition The term vertex edge arise solid geometry
A cube vertex edge form vertex set edge set graph
At page Second Edition We often use name corresponding concept graph digraph model
Many author replace vertex edge node arc discus digraph obscures analogy
Some result statement proof would wasteful repeat change terminology especially Chapter
Also graph G modeled using digraph D edge uv E E G replaced UV vu E E D
In way result digraph applied graph
Since notion edge digraph extends notion edge graph using name make sense
So according book vertex edge undirected graph due analogy solid geometry node arc directed graph
In computer science node edge used case
I think mistake could make use term arc undirected graph
My reading suggests arc edge conceptually
Yet LEMON separate arc edge
I played enough understand difference usage
As I wondering I stumbled upon extra information
I reading book Computational Geometry
In book graph drawn within polygon avoid ambiguity used talk part shape talk graph
The book say following let G graph associated traingulation whose arc edge polygon By posting answer agree

In study mathematical structure used model pairwise relation object
A graph context made connected
A graph may meaning distinction two vertex associated edge edge may one vertex another see detailed definition variation type graph commonly considered
Graphs one prime object study
Refer basic definition graph theory
Definitions graph theory vary
The following basic way defining graph related mathematical structure
In common sense term comprising together set subset
edge associated two vertex association take form comprising two vertex
To avoid ambiguity type graph may described precisely
Other sens stem different conception edge set
In one generalized notion set together relation associate edge two vertex
In another generalized notion unordered pair necessarily distinct vertex
Many author call type object pseudograph
All variant others described fully
The vertex belonging edge called edge
A vertex may exist graph belong edge
usually taken finite many result true rather different infinite graph many argument fail
The graph number vertex
The graph number edge
The vertex number edge connect edge connects vertex counted twice
For edge graph theorist usually use somewhat shorter notation
Graphs used model many type relation process physical biological social information system

Theoretically one distinguish list matrix structure concrete application best structure often combination
List structure often preferred smaller memory requirement
structure hand provide faster access application consume huge amount memory
List structure include array pair vertex separately list neighbor vertex Much like incidence list vertex list vertex adjacent
Matrix structure include matrix whose row represent vertex whose column represent edge row column indexed vertex
In case indicates two adjacent object indicates two object
The modified form adjacency matrix incorporates information vertex useful calculation number graph
The like adjacency matrix row column indexed vertex rather containing cell contains length two vertex

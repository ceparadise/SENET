Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is difference two
As per compiler convert one language another usually low level language assembler
How two different
An assembler translates assembly code machine code
The translation mechanical done one way
In contrast compiler freedom compiles relevant programming language optimize example even compiler produce different code
Also compiler written way separate corresponding programming language corresponding computer architecture whereas assembler two always
The bottom line write compiler assembler
Assembly language usually designed nearly trivial parse type check tend involve lot generator opcode add load instruction destination operand register specified bit
Usually interesting part assembler part resolve symbolic label number
assembler small amount arithmetic adding together symbolic label small constant example assembler either integrated macro processing facility
On Unix system macro feature actually provided running C assembly passing assembler proper
The MIPS assembler go step beyond made interesting code generation decision small amount optimization

Further MIPS machine code notion responsibility assembler abstract away present normal abstract assembly language compiler
So MIPS assembler need local instruction scheduling
The distinction blurred work particular portable assembly language
The relevant paper
And finally also David Walker Greg Morrisett assembler guarantee memory safety
By posting answer agree

In study class ah ha moment finally really understood pointer
Do explanation use beginner programmer seems particularly effective
For example beginner first encounter pointer C might add compiles I
Maybe picture really well motivated example made pointer click student
What try seem work
Were topic prerequisite
structs array
In word necessary understand meaning could use confidence
Learning syntax terminology use case enough point idea need internalized
I really like answer far please keep coming
There lot great perspective I think many good internalized concept
I looking detailed context circumstance dawned
I somewhat understood pointer syntactically I heard two friend explaining pointer another friend asked passed pointer
The first friend talked needed referenced modified short comment friend hit It also efficient
Passing byte instead byte final conceptual shift I needed
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Usually I represent memory grid I make address highlight different memory space write cell value even binary representation link pointer memory value point
And still mention simplification
Usually ohhhh moment student
Then come stop forgetting use simple present way math physic calculation
If divide distance km time hour get speed
What need
Simple
Doing basic example visually represent explained comfort think understood give opportunity say ah I get one
Cover pointer simple type make sure understand difference addressing size data type structs array multiple level
Then start pointer arithmetic
I usually explain recursion similarly using visual representation
Have print alphabet using function writes single char ask print reverse order changing two line
Usually
moment add another parameter printf print numeric value indent step becomes sigh relief
I actually university showed student video explaining pointer memory access using paste
It incredibly clever well done though I never really used technique except young learner interested grasping programming usually I would lead towards language using pointer early
Basically using tiny ball attach bigger ball representing memory space combine together either link like linked data structure merge together contiguous memory space
Using different color memory space pointed pointer help well
But I still think thing work better clearly show pointing really matter addressing
Whereas mode still confuses thinking thing really touch memory
The Water Cup thing used directly colleague well I know came
It interesting approach I noticed many student left puzzled explanation
Something alike
But I think actually misleading one make student confuse container data structure pointer array
It might interesting approach explain array beginning I assume I would stick long
Someone much wiser I said The nun Wu Jincang asked Sixth Patriach Huineng I studied Mahaparinirvana sutra many year yet many area quite understand
Please enlighten
The patriach responded I illiterate
Please read character perhaps I able explain meaning
Said nun You even recognize character
How able understand meaning
Truth nothing word
Truth likened bright moon sky
Words case likened finger
The finger point location
However finger moon
To look moon necessary gaze beyond finger right
I found diagram helpful
Example This sort diagram helped see pointer variable contained value location another object
array string
Also done pencil I could use trace program paper
When I first learned pointer I sort thrust
My university made decision long time I enrolled center curriculum around Java Data Structures professor gave one lecture C asked u implement pointer I felt like I getting something head
I understood definition A pointer variable contains address variable But I still understand large part concept
Looking back I think centered three thing What exactly memory location
At time I take Computer Organization class The awkward syntax So um exactly defined like int subsequently I refer variable ip
How exactly beneficial store address variable rather use variable
It I purchased K R book completed every problem I really got grasp pointer
Besides fact I long completed Computer Organization class I think required learning C part fact I realized pointer used function array structs useful thing merely storage address ordinary variable
But aha moment far way K R explained awkward syntax defining simple pointer
I took note throughout book I rephrase point made book word order understanding one relating A pointer variable contains address variable
A pointer defined dereferenced yielding value stored memory location point operator expression mnemonic
I always felt I could fully grasp advanced concept pointer I something elementary ingrained head
It bothered endlessly assignment I well way exist right I thought I defined
Mastering essential advanced concept involving pointer like function pointer complicated definition like All I think concept pointer requires A basic understanding memory laid computer memory
Knowledge powerful pointer real world usage another abstract concept learn sake learning
Deciphering hieroglyphic colloquially known definition pointer So I think least aha moment learning pointer
I still student I thought appreciate viewpoint someone still relatively fresh learning concept
Pointer bit like application shortcut desktop
Delete shortcut target still exists
Start shortcut target get started
I always explain working simple creating txt file desktop two shortcut file
After copying deleting shortcut see people understand idea behind
Once group understands basic behind shortcut start explaining pointer anyway want
They probably understand pretty easily
year ago I taught intro C course community college
This always fun topic explore
What seemed work best discussing time use coffee cup hand
I used analogy coffee cup row array variable hold something
I used hand could also hold something extending index finger point coffee cup
A close hand null finger pointing head like mock gun dangling pointer
Then demonstration trip debugger clicked
I really get quite worried I hear get grasp pointer question
I always thought concept incredibly simple logical evolution language providing great power programmer
The thing worry I never found difficult understand concept pointer
So finally get start thinking Do I actually get
Maybe I never
Maybe reason concept seems tricky one keep telling everyone yet encounter pointer difficult hundred way learn
Just throwing idea course personally I love good diagram
I never much problem pointer C may I learn assembler first
It actually relief manage address
So maybe answer assuming something teaching give student emulated assembly language work
They figure process writing anything sophisticated Hello world
How I really learned pointer
By writing simple compiler freshman year college
How explain pointer layman term
I like dated
analogy library catalog stored index card
Each card pointer contains information book data located actually contain book
If modify card pointer arithmetic change book point impact book careful screw address might point book even wrong library
However follow address card go proper part library dereference pointer book
A pointer variable whose value memory address another variable
I shall assume someone going learn pointer know normal variable work Now let try define pointer They also variable different nature
Assume two layer variable space
The normal variable different type resides upper layer pointer lower layer
Like As name suggests pointer POINT something
Like finger point object
What thing point
These normal variable
In short Pointers point normal variable
So pointer declared
Almost like normal variable
You precede name asterisk
Then pointer associated variable
Using operator variable like How pointer used pointing variable
This also done preceding name asterisk
Then used place variable pointing instead Now play pointer code
Just get used characteristic pointer
Upto point talking pointer
Once ok start studying pointer pointing variable react normal arithmetic operation applied
Then go relation pointer array pointer pointer
That I shall suggest learning pointer
My path understanding I recall correctly went like
I simple experience assembly programming I still I concept memory bunch box see
This reinforced use array
However I going world C deal string meant pointer
In BASIC trivial assembler I never work classic C pointer stuff
Ah I scuttle back array null terminated string like All well good array char bit per character little world zero character end show end
The printf take array run printing
But I want pas string function
Is manual say
Hmm mean pointer char
OK lost
Then dawned make p equivalent
OK I use I still twigged pointer
I mean I set data one thing
Off manual As I write I saying declare pointer char set equal array character
Somehow pointer away need array
Guess compiler stuff change
So I change array pointer
I know I could use array version equivalent pointer speak
Off manual
I suppose simply mean content memory address
Which meant pointer p address bong
That sound enlightenment
I suddenly twigged pointer long time ago old timer grok later
It indirection
Original OK worth Imagine memory bunch box
Each box number side address
Each box contains number content
You work box way variable I want content box N pointer I want content box
Pointers simply indirection
And big answer cover everything ever need know
Get little block wood
add metal hook one end metal eye
linked list stuff play
Try explaining physical prop
I often wished I teaching pointer first year freshman student
The little metal hook pointer block wood thing pointed
I DEFY anyone get playing block
I made life easier I removed fluff started treating pointer variable rather magical entity long long ago grade know thing The rest syntactic sugar common Just write simple C program like implementing linked list library using pointer get hang
I cant quite remember circumstance around I retroactively refitted memory around understanding array

For reason I find immensely helpful view pointer array whenever I happen upon
Basically Gary Rowe introduced right model
Memory set box address number
Each box store value number
The idea pointer interpret value one box address another box
This value used specific box called
Thus process opening box refered
variable box statement I think server purpose introducing pointer something completely different
It concept hard grasp I kid
It always seemed like dark magic I never truly understood needed lot special character
The first time I understand I wrote small game using double indirection language pointer arithmetic
That enlightened
Pointers matter interpretation
I think explaining make thing lot easier
And pointer arithmetic extremely simple intuitive operation shown simple example memory variable
The explanation really grocked Consider city grid different house built piece land
In hand hold piece paper
On paper written David house So street
The piece paper pointer variable contains address David house
When want tell friend look David cool house much easier use pice paper reference house send actual two story building mail
As real pointer get trouble follow address piece paper
David could moved get find big hole ground
In case would better erase address paper David moved least change new one
You could also find go address enter think friend David living room time end complete stranger swimming pool
Someone else used space address something completely different
If want explain pointer explain memory first
I usually using graph paper row column
If student understands memory understand address
If got address got pointer
You play abstraction

write address number one square another square
Now draw arrow pointer square destination square
Now overwrite pointer
increment adjust arrow
Write address another square let student draw arrow Next step Give certain square like pointer name
Now explain dereferencing
That
Perhaps I work well analogy
So let say friend Foo want someone else different Bar contact reason
Foo could take go see Bar convenient moving being instance around
However Foo could send Bar phone number pointer
That way matter Foo know contact without find
And let say Bar acquaintance Baz also want get touch
But protective phone number want everyone Baz call Bar phone pointer forward call another pointer
And chain Baz friend friend friend
Pointers make sense studied assembly language computer architecture
I think I teach C class I would start couple week architecture explain memory model kind instruction processor actually executes
My aha
moment came tutorial To exact came chapter To even precise came sentence The parameter passed put pointer value pointer since parameter C passed value value pointer address point simply address
When I read cloud parted angel blew trumpet fanfare
For see every C tutorial book I read prior asserted C could pas value reference nefarious lie
The truth C always pass value sometimes value passed happens address
Within method copy made address like copy would made int passed
A copy made value pointer point
Thus using pointer within method access original value change
I never became C programmer I became programmer object object reference work way reference object passed value thus copied object copied
I worked around many programmer understand never learned pointer
The trick explain location thing thing like picture pipe
When move thing location change
The location remains thing put
A pointer sticky note tell something useful
It contains location thing tell big thing C anyway
So double pointer like sticky note say There six pack fridge
You actually go get six pack figure Coke Budweiser
declaring initializing simple variable creating point p variable v int pointer p declare pointer variable type int pointed p data p point address variable v represents literal value p This site great tutorial learning pointer memory management
I would suggest walk pointer basic pointer memory given site
You also look linked list problem given link strengthen pointer concept
The key explaining pointer making sure people explaining already understanding concept memory
Whilst would nice really understood low level believing memory exists massive array understanding access position array index location enough
The next step concept passing index location rather copying entire memory make sense people
And enough allow people understand pointer useful
final step understand pointer explain pas parameter memory index location method store index location data stored
I found step far people cope
Once someone grasped basic step straight forward grasp chain pointer indefinitely long keep track many time need look address find actual data object
Once someone grasped pointer next thing must grasp quickly difference heap memory stack memory pointer stack memory dangerous passed outside method
I remember book C puzzle similar I read purely one related book available library understanding C rudimentary
It threw C expresison asked explion getting complicated
When I university professor really neat powerpoint slide depicting point separate variable arrow memory location represented like array Linked Lists would showing arrow change pointer dereferenced etc way one could understand within couple minute
The concept really easy right applying practical program requires practice
Before I I explain programming everything us memory static variable allocation memory
I also explain memory address relation memory space memory address variable
Finally I explain integer data type variable string data type variable explaining special data type store memory address empty value like called
And finally dynamically allocated variable thru usage pointer

An often abbreviated programmable device strong often correspondence language
Each assembly language specific particular computer architecture
In contrast generally across multiple architecture require
Assembly language may also called
Assembly language converted executable machine code referred
The conversion process referred
computational step assembler run
Assembly language us represent typically also etc
Many operation require one order form complete instruction assembler take number named constant well register operand freeing programmer tedious repetitive calculation
Depending architecture element may also combined specific instruction using data well fixed address
Many assembler offer additional mechanism facilitate program development control assembly process aid
An program creates translating combination mnemonic operation addressing mode numerical equivalent
This representation typically includes well control data
The assembler also calculates constant expression resolve memory location entity
The use symbolic reference key feature assembler saving tedious calculation manual address update program modification
Most assembler also include facility performing textual substitution generate common short sequence instruction instead
Some assembler may also able perform simple type
One concrete example may ubiquitous assembler various vendor
Most able perform replacement long jump replaced short relative jump number pass request
Others may even simple rearrangement insertion instruction assembler help optimize sensible exploit efficiently possible
Like early programming language assembler available since first generation text based
However assembler came first far simpler write
This mnemonic along addressing mode operand instruction translates rather directly numeric representation particular instruction without much context analysis
There also several class translator semi automatic property similar assembly perhaps one better known example
There may several assembler different particular
For instance instruction add memory data register processor might original whereas would written used
Despite different appearance different syntactic form generally generate numeric see
A single assembler may also different mode order support variation syntactic form well exact semantic interpretation ideal mode special case programming
There two type assembler based many pass source needed many time assembler read source produce object file
In case assembler must able determine size instruction initial pass order calculate address subsequent symbol
This mean size operation referring operand defined later depends type distance operand assembler make pessimistic estimate first encountering operation necessary pad one instruction later pas erratum
In assembler address may recalculated pass allow replacing pessimistic code code tailored exact distance target
The original reason use assembler speed assembly often second pas would require rewinding rereading program source rereading deck
Later computer much larger memory especially disc storage space perform necessary processing without
The advantage assembler absence erratum make assembler directly produce executable code faster
following code snippet assembler would able determine address backward reference assembling statement would able determine address forward reference assembling branch statement indeed may undefined
A assembler would determine address pas would known generating code pas More sophisticated provide language abstraction See detail
A program written assembly language consists series processor instruction known variously directive comment data
Assembly language instruction usually consist mnemonic followed list data argument parameter
These translated instruction loaded memory executed
For example instruction tell processor move
The binary code instruction followed identifier register use
The identifier register following load register data
This binary computer code made expressing follows
Here mean copy following value hexadecimal representation value
Assembly language family provides abbreviation instruction machine code written follows assembly language complete explanatory comment required semicolon
This much easier read remember
In assembly language mnemonic MOV may used family related instruction loading copying moving data whether immediate value value register memory location pointed value register
Other assembler may use separate opcode mnemonic L move memory register ST move register memory LR move register register MVI move immediate operand memory etc
The opcode copy value register move
Assembly language example follow
The syntax MOV also complex following example show
In case MOV mnemonic translated directly opcode range assembler programmer know remember
Transforming assembly language machine code job assembler reverse least partially achieved
Unlike many simple assembly statement machine language instruction
However case assembler may provide essentially macro expand several machine language instruction provide commonly needed functionality
For example machine lack branch greater equal instruction assembler may provide pseudoinstruction expands machine set le branch zero result set instruction
Most assembler also provide rich language discussed used vendor programmer generate complex code data sequence
Each machine language
Computers differ number type operation support different size number register representation data storage
While computer able carry essentially functionality way differ corresponding assembly language reflect difference
Multiple set syntax may exist single instruction set typically instantiated different assembler program
In case popular one usually supplied manufacturer used documentation
There large degree diversity way author assembler categorize statement nomenclature use
In particular describe anything machine mnemonic extended mnemonic
A typical assembly language consists type instruction statement used define program operation Instructions statement assembly language generally simple unlike
Generally mnemonic symbolic name single executable machine language instruction least one opcode mnemonic defined machine language instruction
Each instruction typically consists plus zero
Most instruction refer single value pair value
Operands immediate value coded instruction register specified instruction implied address data located elsewhere storage
This determined underlying processor architecture assembler merely reflects architecture work
often used specify combination opcode specific operand assembler use extended mnemonic mask NO OPeration nothing one step mask often used support specialized us instruction often purpose obvious instruction name
For example many CPU explicit NOP instruction instruction used purpose
In CPUs instruction used encode instruction
Some disassemblers recognize decode instruction
Similarly IBM assembler use extended mnemonic zero mask
For SPARC architecture known
Some assembler also support simple generate two machine instruction
For instance assembler instruction recognized generate followed
These sometimes known
Mnemonics arbitrary symbol published Standard uniform set mnemonic used assembler
The standard since withdrawn
There instruction used define data element hold data variable
They define type data length data
These instruction also define whether data available outside program program assembled separately program data section defined
Some assembler classify
Assembly directive also called command given assembler directing perform operation assembling instruction
Directives affect assembler operates may affect object code symbol table listing file value internal assembler parameter
Sometimes term reserved directive generate object code generate data
The name often start dot distinguish machine instruction
make assembly program dependent parameter input programmer one program assembled different way perhaps different application
Or used manipulate presentation program make easier read maintain
Another common use reserve storage area data optionally initialize content known value
Symbolic assembler let programmer associate arbitrary name memory location various constant
Usually every constant variable given name instruction reference location name thus promoting
In executable code name subroutine associated entry point call subroutine use name
Inside subroutine destination given label
Some assembler support lexically distinct normal symbol use GOTO destination
Some assembler NASM provide flexible symbol management letting programmer manage different automatically calculate offset within assign label refer literal value result simple computation performed assembler
Labels also used initialize constant variable relocatable address
Assembly language like computer language allow comment added program ignored assembly
Judicious commenting essential assembly language program meaning purpose sequence binary machine instruction difficult determine
The raw uncommented assembly language generated compiler disassemblers quite difficult read change must made
Many assembler support others support repeatedly macro involving sequence text line variable constant embedded
This sequence text line may include opcodes directive
Once macro defined name may used place mnemonic
When assembler process statement replaces statement text line associated macro process existed source code file including assembler expansion macro existing replacement text
Macros sense date IBM
In assembly language term macro represents comprehensive concept context define directive typically used create short single line macro
Assembler macro instruction like macro language lengthy program executed interpretation assembler assembly
Since macro name expand several indeed many line code used make assembly language program appear far shorter requiring fewer line source code higher level language
They also used add higher level structure assembly program optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameter similar feature
Macro assembler often allow macro take
Some assembler include quite sophisticated macro language incorporating language element optional parameter symbolic variable conditionals string manipulation arithmetic operation usable execution given macro allowing macro save context exchange information
Thus macro might generate numerous assembly language instruction data definition based macro argument
This could used generate data structure unrolled loop example could generate entire algorithm based complex parameter
For instance sort macro could accept specification complex sort key generate code crafted specific key needing test would required general procedure interpreting specification
An organization using assembly language heavily extended using macro suite considered working language since programmer working computer conceptual element
Underlining point macro used implement early written SNOBOL Implementation Language SIL assembly language virtual machine targeted physical machine transpiled native assembler via
This allowed high degree portability time
Macros used customize large scale software system specific customer mainframe era also used customer personnel satisfy employer need making specific version manufacturer operating system
This done example system programmer working Conversational Monitor System Virtual Machine IBM real time transaction processing Customer Information Control System system began still run many large CRS credit card system today
It also possible use solely macro processing ability assembler generate code written completely different language example generate version program using pure macro assembler program containing line COBOL code inside assembly time operator instructing assembler generate arbitrary code
IBM us macro perform
The user specifies option coding series assembler macro
Assembling macro generates build system including control statement
This realized concept macro processing independent concept assembly former modern term word processing text processing generating object code
The concept macro processing appeared appears C programming language support preprocessor instruction set variable make conditional test value
Note unlike certain previous macro processor inside assembler C preprocessor lack ability either loop go latter allowing program loop
Despite power macro processing fell disuse many high level language major exception remaining perennial assembler
Macro parameter substitution strictly name macro processing time value parameter textually substituted name
The famous class bug resulting use parameter expression simple name macro writer expected name
In macro intention caller would provide name variable global variable constant b would used multiply
If foo called parameter macro expansion occurs
To avoid possible ambiguity user macro processor parenthesize formal parameter inside macro definition caller parenthesize input parameter
Some assembler incorporated element encode execution flow
The earliest example approach originally proposed March implemented Marvin Kessler IBM Federal Systems Division extended macro assembler similar control flow block
This way reduce eliminate use operation assembly code one main factor causing assembly language
This approach widely accepted early latter day assembly language use
A curious design assembler processor developer operating system reported first commercial
The language classified assembler worked raw machine element memory reference incorporated expression syntax indicate execution order
Parentheses special symbol along structured programming construct controlled sequence generated instruction
built object language C compiler rather logical syntax fan
There little apparent demand sophisticated assembler since decline assembly language development
In spite still developed applied case resource constraint peculiarity target system architecture prevent effective use language
Assemblers strong macro engine allow structured programming via macro switch macro provided package note code complete program Assembly language use word date introduction
The first assembly language developed following work
The EDSAC assembler called featuring mnemonic
SOAP Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program assembly language computer written Stan Poley
Assembly language eliminate much tedious programming needed earliest computer freeing programmer tedium remembering numeric code calculating address
They widely used sort programming
However use largely supplanted language search improved
Today assembly language still used direct hardware manipulation access specialized processor instruction address critical performance issue
Typical us system
Historically numerous program written entirely assembly language
The first computer operating system developed entirely assembly language written ESPOL Algol dialect
Many commercial application written assembly language well including large amount software written large corporation
eventually displaced much work although number large organization retained application infrastructure well
Most early microcomputer relied assembly language including operating system large application
This system severe resource constraint imposed idiosyncratic memory display architecture provided limited buggy system service
Perhaps important lack language compiler suitable microcomputer use
A psychological factor may also played role first generation microcomputer programmer retained hobbyist wire plier attitude
In commercial context biggest reason using assembly language minimal bloat size minimal overhead greater speed reliability
Typical example large assembly language program time IBM PC operating system compiler early application program
According industry insider assembly language best computer language use get best performance console notoriously challenging develop program game
The arcade game another example
Assembly language long primary development language many popular home computer
This large part BASIC dialect system offered insufficient execution speed well insufficient facility take full advantage available hardware system
Some system even IDE highly advanced debugging macro facility
Some compiler available successor capability combine inline assembly source program statement
Upon compilation assembler produced inline machine code
There always debate usefulness performance assembly language relative language
Assembly language specific niche us important see
As July programming language popularity rank assembly language ahead example
Assembler used optimize speed optimize size
In case speed optimization modern claimed render language code run fast assembly despite found
The complexity modern processor memory make effective optimization increasingly difficult compiler well assembly programmer
Moreover increasing processor performance meant CPUs sit idle time delay caused predictable bottleneck cache miss operation
This made raw code execution speed many programmer
There situation developer might choose use assembly language Assembly language still taught program
Although programmer today regularly work assembly language tool underlying concept remain important
Such fundamental topic encoding processing design would hard study detail without grasp computer operates hardware level
Since computer behavior fundamentally defined instruction set logical way learn concept study assembly language
Most modern computer similar instruction set
Therefore studying single assembly language sufficient learn I basic concept II recognize situation use assembly language might appropriate III see efficient executable code created language
This analogous child needing learn basic arithmetic operation long division although widely used except trivial calculation

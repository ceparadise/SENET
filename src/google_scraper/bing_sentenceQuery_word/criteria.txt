This question already answer Specifically I seen used context text filtering
As predicate filter criterion
Is accurate
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
It term commonly used field Mathematical Logic
From In mathematics predicate either amount characteristic function indicator function relation
A function P true false called predicate X
When P predicate X sometimes say P property
predicate filter criterion A predicate part sentence contains verb tell something subject
For instance sentence Mike eating subject predicate eating
In context computer science interested stating fact rather testing condition purpose deciding whether something
The member instance predicate
It return assertion case eating
The predicate used decide whether feed person
Predicates often found form callback general use term function return bool based evaluation truth assertion
For sorting might want member function predicate
If come u sorting algorithm swap two fruit
There also term predicate
In English use like Graduation predicated upon attainment passing grade
It mean one thing depends another
In computer science use form word describe conditional execution
For instance CUDA programming assembly instruction whose execution predicate KATE prior result
That set predicate CAT flag true cause instruction executed false cause instruction treated NOP
Thus execution instruction predicated upon indicated predicate flag
The us similar
Hope help
The word come logic
A predicate boolean question input
IsNull predicate question
Also wikipedia link
A predicate statement something either true false
Proposition Predicate Use quantifier transform predicate proposition Just simplify thing
predicate function return true false value
used filter criterion meaning let consider array number predicate return true number false wise
filter function return new array based predicate filter criterion
filtered array based value predicate Predicate function take one element input parameter return either true false
Predicates used higher order function applied given function transformer list element return list result
Transformer function applies element produce one new element

Examples user guide white paper help guide
It becoming le common see paper documentation
Documentation distributed via website software product application
Professionals educated field termed documentalists
This field changed name us term documentation still exists effort reintroduce term documentation field study
While associated standard easily available publicly guide source topic may serve purpose

David Berger provided several principle document writing regarding term used procedure numbering even length sentence etc
The following list guide dealing specific field type The procedure documentation vary one sector one type another
In general may involve document drafting formatting submitting reviewing approving distributing reposting tracking convened associated regulatory industry
It could also involve creating content scratch
Documentation easy read understand
If long wordy may misunderstood ignored
Clear Short Familiar word used maximum word sentence
Only gender hyper neutral word used cultural bias avoided
Procedures numbered performed

Technical writer corporate communicator professional whose field work documentation
Ideally technical writer background subject matter also writing managing content information architecture
Technical writer commonly collaborate subject matter expert SMEs engineer technical expert medical professional type client define create content documentation meet user need
Corporate communication includes type written documentation required company
The following typical software documentation type The following typical hardware service documentation type Documentation include feasibility report technical documentation operational documentation log book etc
There many type software application used create documentation
SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER SDF A common type software document written software engineer simulation industry SDF
When developing software simulator range embedded avionics device terrain database way full motion control system engineer keep notebook detailing development build project module
The document wiki page MS word document environment
They contain section section detail communication interface software
Often section used detail proof concept track error enhancement
Finally section document software tested
This document conformance client requirement
The result detailed description software designed build install software target device known defect
This build document enables future developer maintainer come speed software timely manner also provides roadmap modifying code searching bug
SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK INVENTORY AND CONFIGURATION These software tool automatically collect data network equipment
The data could inventory configuration information
The request create database basis information IT responsible
It also basis IT documentation
Examples include XIA Configuration
Documentation preferred term process populating criminal database
Examples include TIDE gang database

Technical documentation refers documentation describes product service operates
For example software code documentation technical specification API documentation
User documentation refers documentation product service provided end user
The user documentation designed assist end user use product service
This often referred user assistance
The user documentation part overall product delivered customer
Traditionally user documentation provided user guide instruction manual online help
However user documentation increasingly delivered online today
This enabled technical writer imaginative assist user
Now user expect user documentation include The used gratitude Dartford computer science department
The quality user documentation affect rate implementation new system
Examples include method help file online support printed manual
I heard rumor Steve Jobs
According rumor said need write manual software done something wrong
I think point rumor software clear easy possible use
However good user documentation make break success product
The presentation evaluation user documentation really important part developing software
Sadly also area software developer might think boring
A small business computer kiosk inside store allows customer sign email newsletter
If customer sign newsletter inside store get discount first purchase store
The owner hope discount incentive customer sign email newsletter
The business regularly email customer special offer saving
The business owner expects benefit system increased sale
The customer expect benefit system access special offer save money see new trendy store
Question importance user documentation owner customer
Question different method providing user documentation case
A school student secure application manages attendance data
The school administrator carefully track attendance student student absent customizable threshold
For example school might set threshold absence within day automatically notifies student parent teacher problem attendance
The threshold might time within day something like
The system keep track attendance tardies
The system customizable attendance code
For example absence school trip excused absence medical absence allowed absence code
School administrator expect benefit data attendance support student parent school
School administrator also expect benefit giving parent student information attendance parent support child school
Finally school administrator expect benefit using attendance data government funding prove many student class specific day
Parents expect benefit knowing child school miss school
This way parent support child school
Being school school parent
Students expect benefit understanding many day school missed
The school expects student strong ownership learning manage attendance
Question importance user documentation owner customer
Question different method providing user documentation case

When designing program must spend time thinking structure program module needed algorithm process use module
You must think sort data structure object array file linked list needed
This thinking must done start coding find wasting time writing useless code full error
It important record creative process programmer follow duplicate work already done
Before writing code write documentation describe design component program
Writing documentation module writing code help define exactly module interact module
Focusing design step needed solve problem help prevent error completed program
For individual module important record written module module written modified module written modified module interacts module special algorithm used acknowledge outside source idea algorithm
For data structure important record data structure used particular structure used data contained structure data structure implemented
The following section contain guideline documentation appear program file containing main program function
Documentation comment line begin double slash text end line considered comment
Documentation appear main program program header function function header next line code within function line comment To help get started framework file found bgunix
Here example typical programming assignment CS
CS Lab Assignment Due pm October A small university need help keeping track enrollment ten course
They asked write program help task
The first thing want list enrollment data order id number
Write program read data sort id number print sorted list
They would also like see total enrollment course
Input The user prompted id number enrollment course
Method Your program contain parallel array contain data
Use separate function read sort print data array
You use bubble sort sort data
Output Should neatly labeled easy read
It include id number course enrollment course
Print output table form
A sample solution presented
The comment solution representative type documentation put programming assignment
The code also entered style effective student learning language
As reading example please note following point referred using number
Functions line counting comment recommended
In practice mean ca see entire block terminal screen one time probably need broken component fit screen
main function often tend long
It recommended exceed line total program length whichever le
Whitespace The format source code important readability program
The term format refers horizontal vertical white space
In higher level language blank line used vertical spacing horizontal spacing block code indented
identifier The identifier function variable constant name used also affect readability program
Make identifier carefully creatively choosing name close English long enough meaningful term task performed
For example testScores much better name array intArray computeAverage better name function doCalculations
All include file used program file put beginning file
Put include file include file following short example Correct spelling good grammar used throughout comment
Be prepared evaluated programmer technical writer
The following table show format indent various feature
When using object oriented programming language programmer often create class declare object class type
These program frequently composed several file one header file containing class definition implementation file containing class function file containing main program
The following describes documentation appear file
Documentation header file must clearly describe class interface
That task performed member function described client program declared object class type know exactly class
This documentation written even understand
Header file documentation appear class declaration statement contain following
Here example This file begin class name function belong programmer name class time project
For example Each function file documented shown function header CS example

By Let honest
No one want write read actually
I talking documentation usually defined step Project Life Cycle
Although documentation occur point I focusing tip documentation phase
Please note two subset documentation I discussing
While research article I pulled editor Anthony Ralston Chester Meek
It definitely first edition classic thing timeless
It state Documentation listing Your opinion documentation phase Project Life Cycle likely depends role IT organization
If manager project lead documentation critical success project
If position documentation annoying nuisance get way work
While tip mainly targeted toward latter category manager supervisor also benefit
The old adage picture worth thousand word mean using picture augment text minimize length complexity documentation
System user like picture diagram table bulleted list quick reference
Examples excellent way end user quickly grasp concept may fully understand
It also good way end user learning new software sit tackle new challenge easily
Here example documentation picture term Microsoft us saving shadow copy file
If working document project labor intensive accidentally lost part work go back previous version
Think automated way make snapshot file looked previous point time
But first configure Vista Previous Versions Figures B E turned scroll bar scroll logical find one want enable Previous Versions
That logical drive name Documents example
check box next logical drive name
Apply OK close System Properties window
File Close red X box part Control Panel System window close
To restore previous version file filename Explorer Restore previous version
Even know targeted user base documentation need written anyone basic computer skill read learn properly use system
instruction provided possible consider placing appendix separate chapter making available via hyperlink avoid clutter
If documentation change mindset place shoe new system user
That difficult first pay attention detail fully document feature function create documentation assume user figure information procedure failed include
Do assume end user understands acronym litter IT landscape
The first time present new acronym detail acronym stand
When testing system tried best break software way could
If software known issue developer like call issue end user call bug document workaround provide user help desk
You save lot frustration end user also lot extra call help desk
Document event inevitable lifetime system Your documentation anticipate problem provide detailed plan instruction system recovery
Will person replaces know find documentation purchased vendor application documentation
All document neatly organized stored together safe known place
Another good example anticipating problem Millennium Bug problem solution
The medium began reporting late system software likely fail due storage two digit year legacy system
This problem anticipated advance lot effort went fixing problem occurred
Software development built certified compliant year advance January
The result remarkably successful
Except minor reported problem New Year Day festive occasion disaster IT community though lot u
The mindset used anticipate problem might arise documentation
The problem also illustrates need continual document updating
Documentation changed note compliance noncompliance software system
For older legacy system workarounds found documented
Sit follow instruction
If documenting building server network IT system start clean partition build everything scratch
You undoubtedly discover left something instruction unclear
Work uninformed committed get feedback publish
Let test documentation
You amazed learn sit person work software documentation first time
A lot feature software obvious obvious someone honest willing work
Watch closely navigating software
Ask feedback take note
I remember feedback I got testing one project
The feedback written I could review point point
The first thought came mind long take
You may also take comment critical personal
Do make mistake
Looking back I implemented missing feature helpful critic provided
Use opportunity make final tweak project
Feedback documentation process help make overall project successful
I writing review Foxconn motherboard I ran across two error manual
I first person review board
Foxconn missed error reviewer missed error well
One mistake manual far trivial
The diagram manual showing normal position clear CMOS jumper setting incorrect
I know turning motherboard verify proper seating heatsink jumper fell
I put jumper back according instruction manual
The computer failed POST
After careful look tiny diagram motherboard I discovered error corrected misplaced jumper
I working tech Foxconn time kind enough answer question I informed error
Documentation error like easy miss lead potentially large cost manufacturer
I would missed error fact jumper loose enough fall turning motherboard
How many time read user manual wondered really human end creation manual computer made manual
Although want create colorful novel humanize document enough personality reader feel little comfortable reading
Documentation costly even done correctly
New technology continue created help create effective documentation le costly develop
Look new tool opportunity reduce time cost documentation process
Documenting part project team especially difficult
Your documentation need shared added documentation team member
Changes made often daily basis
Software exists allow help ensure standardized end product also help foster sharing idea knowledge among team member
While working CSC Computer Sciences Corporation I experimented Microsoft Agent technology mixed result
I always thought offered wonderful way guide new user feature system
Some may remember offensive little paper clip character blinking eye Word
It slightly annoying
With Agent character move across screen point box programmatically open box allow character speak option presented
I created guided tour software let Peedy parrot point box fill text box change screen generally walk end user entire process creating new record database
I found using Agent saved write many tedious page documentation detailed step necessary create save modify new record
It also fun develop
It allowed creative side participate positive beneficial way
Creativity developer key component make successful
Creativity considered developing documentation depending standard expectation company
The feedback I received MS Agent experiment never taken seriously least part comical looking character
It lot extra work build require learn new coding technique
It pleasure person department trained
I told take guided tour
Perhaps Microsoft ahead time respectable character type technology could still become mainstream one day
I recently built computer dad wedding anniversary gift
I documented note marked left shortcut desktop
I also created audio file documented feature use computer
I ask looked note offered tell took case computer audio tour
These example alternative way document
It humble writer opinion new way document underutilized underestimated simplicity potential impact today corporate environment
The elusive end documentation software package yet developed designed specific documentation task
The best person document builder
After know system better system builder
If system builder likely crack programmer
But mention word programmer given got kidding look
If forced programmer document work least make attempt create something pas documentation
I know
I seen often even guilty
And real shame programmer good documentation skill valuable asset company
What manager remember performance review time another person documentation project
My guess wo deserve promotion raise bonus
While exactly fun documentation rewarding done correctly
Not better overall project present customer also greatly reduce future support time provide
You also reduce amount support maintenance time help desk
When working CSC I given opportunity project lead design creation global reporting system infrastructure
I got see first hand side documentation
We good programmer group Crystal Reports API work custom function building
It obvious knowledge unique needed shared rest team better way properly document work
I entirely successful getting explain work point another person could step pick
He list explain function name use worked accomplished helpful member team
There seems unwritten rule Realm Code programming skill inversely proportional amount documentation programmer
The second greatest compliment ever paid career I give presentation global technical support team
I create present documentation build reporting server
One database administrator chap England sit presentation
He looked document paraphrase commented good documentation able build reporting server using documentation
Statements like make hard work worth
And compliment main project work documentation
You cut documentation time build User Documentation time write System Documentation
You share information two reduce missing information
Even want inappropriate share information document benefit topic one document prompt include additional documentation
Create follow standard format guideline
This help ensure important information excluded allow easier reading system user
The one time I dedicated documentation expert work document system Hughes Aircraft Company
The result excellent
The format department standard result better I would done
It required lot time effort get result
The documentation expert needed access beta system access I could answer question
This expensive company resource allocate professional documentation result excellent system builder verify important information misinterpreted left end product
I fortunate I former engineer also excellent writing documentation
He understood system designed built filled blank actually using system discovering worked
You may fortunate
In day age global marketing sale support documentation also follow country regional standard
I often irritated reading manual piece electronic gear made China often difficult translate
It written Chinglish sentence I pause try comprehend
I usually make mental Scooby Doo sound move rest manual
Were documentation pro learn never write Chinese I imagine Englese would sound people
Find use professional translator make documentation understandable important information lost translation
I also state obvious
Your documentation free misspelling grammatical error
Always use find error
I never cease amazed many obvious spelling error I made simply missed reread
If I already convinced creating good documentation good employer take comfort fact creating good documentation menial task
When document work also documentation
Hopefully tip help avoid disruptive question bound come way friendly help desk tech
This first officially published document
I want personally thank Sonja Thompson Mark Kaelin giving opportunity share thought
I sure Mark decided offer opportunity discus daunting subject documentation first article
Perhaps figured I could write interesting article documentation I could write almost anything
I glad though thanks TechRepublic I convey tool trade

I want find order subgroup According note order subgroup
But like
I thought would ab ab ab ab ba Is like
The diagram subgroup note But right one maybe like
As discussed comment subgroup order two correctly demonstrated index three
Furthermore second diagram correct subgroup lattice red number indicate order subgroup corresponding row

Computer Science CS Information Technology IT branch appear twin synonymous many reality different objective
Also misconception among parent student community large CS wider scope IT thus leading demand former
In fact equal scope student branch equally employable IT software industry
Computer Science computer astronomy telescope
Renowned Computer Scientist Edsger Dijkstra made observation
Computer Science engineer involved many aspect computing design individual microprocessor personal computer supercomputer circuit design writing software power
They also suited robotics research relies heavily using digital system like motor sensor different machine
Information Technology IT deal use electronic computer computer software store protect process transit securely retrieve information
IT general term describes technology help produce manipulate store communicate information
IT professional perform variety duty range installing application designing complex computer network information database
They suited data management networking engineering computer hardware database software design well efficient management administration entire system
Computer Science study principle computing computer solve problem
You study different type problem computer solve one would present problem computer
Abstract idea rely fundamental mathematical theory basis Computer Science
Information Systems study best meet Information management need particular organization
These tool human technological
Familiarity tool essential successful IT professional
The relationship two field lie fact come specific technology tool needed solve problem Computer Scientists design tool Information Systems professional apply tool maximum benefit particular organization task
Computer Science application research often combine pillar information management computation system design domain specific area linking aspect engineering science art mathematics
Such domain specific research includes Robotics Control Machine Vision Interaction Geographic Information Systems Music Technology Finance Media Studies
The combination degree domain knowledge expertise discipline Computer Science open wealth employment opportunity
Information Technology hardware software product system result work Computer Science discipline associated generation manipulation storage retrieval analysis sharing digital information kind
A computer iPod mobile phone camcorder Microsoft Word Mozilla Firefox Linux Windows Operating Systems Wireless Network Tata Sky TV box GPS unit social networking site information portal payment transaction service example information technology
Exposure experience understanding many technology acquired practical work associated course
Ultimately would really matter student far course curriculum different
Most institute including IITs IIITs NITs either CSE IT
This clearly signal difference two branch significant enough warrant simultaneous presence campus least eye top engineering college country
Further college offer IT CSE difference course structure minimal
It might help imagine like CS engineer architect construction worker
They design build house also play role electrician plumber installation specialist put light running water appliance house
IT professional live house use appliance effectively efficiently desired effect
There overlap within two field
Essentially exist subsection discipline performing complementary different task fit together like gear
Hopefully distinction three professional area clear
If IT want King University Online get
Earning bachelor degree information technology online first step toward career
If choose IT CSE option hand would wise decide basis reputation standing college rather branch
If choose IT CSE college see excites design computer computing system using computer solve information management requirement organization

With next group Is function list subgroup G
Thanks sorry question look easy newbie GAP
One think term conjugacy class subgroup For example mean conjugacy class subgroup
The element returned list example conjugacy class trivial subgroup general order class listed depends method chosen GAP rely always
Now take example conjugacy class list
It contains subgroup We use get representative class get subgroup class GAP also function since GAP
Instead using one think algorithmically
Do need subgroup conjugacy
Do want normal subgroup maximal maybe particular order isomorphism type
In case look If p needed often faster compute subgroup lattice Sylow p see use conjugation find normal
Furthermore accept optional argument allow put restriction computed subgroup
In latter case function may used
For advanced technique see also Chapter particular Section work group whose table contained table mark library

How I make subgroup reference optional
For example I would like replaced nothing optional subgroup matched raise exception
I know I use check group present seems like lot work would need bunch replacement pattern since example go
It also fast since need
For example JavaScript I use matched ignored I understand correctly instead Another option provide explicit empty alternative Also use instead
I would like
Just put pattern inside group make optional
Now include optional group inside capturing group

hey frnds plzz help finding application group theory used real life help
In mathematics application group theory endless
In physic relation group symmetry mean group theory play huge role formulation physic
Fundamental modern physic representation theory Lie group
Lie group like Poincare group SU n O n etc play fundamental role physic
In chemistry group theory used describe symmetry crystal molecular structure
This important understanding physical spectroscopic property material example
Probably group theory powerful branch mathematics come quantum chemistry spectroscopy condensed matter physic
thank u much bt want sumthing like group theory used daily life daily routine Integers standard addition form abelian group
Real number form abelian group addition real number form abelian group standard multiplication
We commutative ring fact field
These thing spring mind everyday life
For example fact real number form abelian group addition used working change buy something
That said maybe bit overkill
Group action performed deck hand card could considered application group theory even though would really think like
I know application group theory music theory
The chromatic scale Western music consists note C C D D E F F G
A A B
An interval distance one note another
interval semitone interval interval minor third etc
Note starting note note also semitone interval
The unison interval interval one

All interval whole octave identified unison interval
Intervals added result number semitone modulo first note last
sum interval
It follows set interval addition operation form group cyclic group order
The identity element unision interval group generated four interval semitone perfect fourth perfect fifth major seventh
This cyclic group order basis theory
It also explains two namely subgroup generated interval subgroup order index consider Election Methods applied Group give back Integer Set output Elected member Integer Set S Sn Si n represent election choice n member Group Frequency Test one way Election Elected Member Max Frequency S given example group member made election S Elected Election one important example Mathematics Statistics Not quite sure real life
But certainly real
In chemistry group theory used describe symmetry crystal molecular structure
This important understanding physical spectroscopic property material example
Probably group theory powerful branch mathematics come quantum chemistry spectroscopy condensed matter physic
Very true
I use symmetry operation daily basis analyzing UV spectroscopy looking specific electronic transition
The concept difficult get handle first well worth
Maybe one day DFT advance level I consciously remember symmetry operation point group
That would nice
I hope computer scientist engineer job though

hey frnds plzz help finding application group theory used real life help All true
But everyday mundane application balancing ckeckbook us abelian group operation integer
plzzz help finding application group theory field computer science Just quick thought importance group theory spectroscopy
The group concerned symmetry molecule predict transition energy state permitted
According math hydrated copper sulphate blue Cobalt chloride white certainly change colour blue pink response humidity change ruby colourless
It fair say group theory

Definitely

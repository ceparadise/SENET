As technology change rapidly academy respond challenge educating unwritten future
John Gilbey went Silicon Valley find It commencement weekend sidewalk campus sizzling full heat beautiful June afternoon
The lawn mown precision would shame many golf course playing host huge white marquee day ceremony ending
The campus changed since last visit newly sprouted building confuse memory route computer science department
But using concrete beacon Hoover Tower guide I manage find William Gates building second attempt
I Silicon Valley talk key local figure future teach computer science topic currently high agenda UK
The subject widely offered popular undergraduate course study
According latest figure Higher Education Statistics Agency computer science offered UK higher education institution undergraduate year studying computer science related topic academic year
The number student graduating year grown le nearly
This peak shortly bubble burst still account per cent UK graduate see Categorical variable computer science graduate number box
In US graduate roughly analogous subject consistently account lower proportion total graduate cohort per cent recent year figure available
But still amounted nearly student
Clearly number big want make sure introduce student material way thinking immediately useful employment good foundation future career development
But Higher Education Funding Council England concerned enough extent happening chart way forward
The review due report next month October chairman Sir Nigel Shadbolt note computer science consistently highest rate unemployed graduate subject UK
Shadbolt professor computer science principal Jesus College Oxford note concern industry skill agility computer science graduate
Other concern include proportion undergraduate computer science student progress level employment reliance computer science department international recruitment fill lab postgraduate course
It essential acknowledge sheer importance computer science profession hence way university prepare people enter
Stanford heart Silicon Valley culture top global destination seeking career computer industry
Huge development spun around world year since university became one founding site ARPANET technical precursor internet
From almost niche area technical scientific business interest computing escaped concrete citadel mainframe computer become almost universally networked
It form vital core connectivity human environment innately mobile population
Alex Aiken chair Stanford computer science department describes computing revolution social experiment worldwide scale
These kind change come along often
The printing press changed world going similar kind transformation clear
The implication entirely understood lot He right advance computing leading change way fundamental development society diffusion line work leisure time managed number unintended consequence
Computer science graduate centre world shaped
A lot decision affect many people made technical people designing system Aiken continues
Some decision essentially get baked become hard change
Some affect privacy people interact real consideration
There need computer scientist aware implication And computing graduate typically dealing prosaic matter decision still significant social impact winner loser
Aiken sure demand graduate employment market hold
You would hope one promise technology improved productivity essentially mean fewer people acknowledges
From I see working well sure activity automated demand people ability design build system insatiable
I know percentage world important software written Valley certainly significant fraction producing anywhere near many people industry would like even though Stanford major computer science grown factor four past five In light astonishing salary commanded Silicon Valley skilled software folk evident still huge demand market least California information system information technology worker
For long time wondered people major computer science Aiken reflects
Everyone field believed future represented important way thinking
Now world belief u overwhelming number Keen speak impressive local customer computer science expertise I take cab mile two westward along Sand Hill Road Kavli Institute Particle Astrophysics Cosmology overlook main Stanford campus much Silicon Valley
Its director Tom Abel explains team heavy user supercomputer innovative software
For u physic computer laboratory
We take neutron star throw another look go say
Even could want make bunch black hole Earth experiment
But supercomputer phenomenal
We try many thing
On data side type experiment moved involving team say five people team
Of course Large Hadron Collider Cern like people involved
There many project moving direction
It end lot equation need implemented way utilises ten thousand processor simultaneously lot skill way cobble together leverage Particle physic reasonably lay claim original home big data followed path many field may potentially become major employer computer science graduate
Data management mining big business mean big infrastructure need new type thinking deliver result
This embedding computer science within discipline suggests computer scientist going need highly developed interpersonal teamworking management skill university course going even provide
Not everyone Silicon Valley us supercomputing everyday work mean opinion future computer science teaching
In middle downtown Palo Alto Institute Future forecasting organisation occupies repurposed storefront
In edgy almost industrial space I meet Mike Liebhold institute principal technologist worked famous Silicon Valley name Apple Atari Intel Netscape
I ask apart computer science teaching
His perspective interesting reflects much le optimism Aiken extent demand human programmer hold
For key issue enable future computer science graduate keep Application Programming Interface API essence retain human role
In future automation able delegate lot task networked machine
But also lot human task going algorithmically directed Liebhold note citing example Uber taxi application
There algorithm route dispatch car people working personal dispatcher working algorithm
So In view speed technological change university must take call future perspective
I think foresight mandatory course Liebhold say
Everyone learn systematically think five year upstream get early
Then cognitive space shape desired This sage advice probably adopted widely computer science
Another key element future course design Liebhold critical importance human factor user experience
And third known field parallelism ability computer break problem multiple element solve simultaneously
I believe naturally solve problem factoring multiple concurrent parallel process human brain work way Liebhold say
And yet built wonderful global supercomputer It seems keep machine future graduate need increasingly adept thinking
Simon Quellen Field written commercial software Silicon Valley year also successful author
At Google eleventh worked ran team taught improved programming technique
For employability developer much technical skill
The best filter selecting developer job ask Is someone constantly going tell thing
Is someone want lunch every day learn
Can get along person interpersonal friction going make everything slow Sceptics might question whether ability engage people something teach
But certainly possible provide awareness issue highlight behaviour adopted
That would good start
As I leave Quellen Field give Arduino Nano computer tiny single circuit board fit neatly wallet
These cost dollar us drive art science teaching project simultaneously hark back origin personal computing offer accessible route anyone interested developing skill current software engineering
The Arduino cousin Raspberry Pi already used undergraduate course adopted widely
Such device give immediacy computer science seen since manufacturer stopped shipping PCs copy BASIC programming language installed
Hacking computer give liberty learning allowing play explore invent make stuff happen real world
A lot demanded next generation computer scientist
If wildly unscientific survey anything go opinion Silicon Valley reinforces view require wide range skill
They need good communicator team player continually refresh knowledge ass direction industry society
To succeed need home massively parallel hugely complex scalable system equally aware increasingly intimate relationship end user technology
How live challenge preparing
I guess ensuring academic great communicator team player keenly exploring great new stuff appears
I seen excellent example need keep developing teaching least fast industry changing
I ride back airport Bay Area Rapid Transit metro train using board flight Heathrow
As Boeing equipped digital flight deck rise bright light Silicon Valley I reflect many thousand computer science graduate contributed safety timeliness efficiency journey
Tomorrow graduate face repeated challenge technical social change career progress
The change seen past year may one day seem trivial compared coming decade
But thankfully tool technical infrastructure help relish changing world improving time
If educator also keep upgrading skill future look bright
Graduates science technology engineering mathematics critical UK economy
Alarm bell rang apparently high rate unemployment noted among graduate subject
Two review launched due report next month
One led Sir William Wakeham looking STEM degree provision graduate employability general
My review focusing computer science degree seen template future detailed review subject discipline
Both review charged exploring degree accreditation contributes positive employment outcome
The methodology Shadbolt review number element
First data Higher Education Statistics Agency establishes fact graduate employment
I pattern reveals
The best way balanced discussion publish much data possible enables wider conversation say interpreted good
Computer science IT degree unusual almost every institution offer course
In past six year student started computer science course physic chemistry math combined
Unemployment among computer science measured Destinations Leavers Higher Education survey running around per cent decline since peak
But survey also reveals variation according region type institution demographic background
A second element review methodology consultation stakeholder
This revealed number theme
One advantage conferred student employment experience fact often great deal informal work experience captured data nevertheless make difference
The employment landscape computer science graduate heterogeneous
IT computing underpins many aspect business across many sector scale
SMEs large corporation want different thing graduate
Some require hard technical skill others prioritise broader soft skill effective communication
The computer science landscape also
A significant challenge institution provide agile content securing core essential knowledge
There recognition among consulted accreditation need adapt
It well understood either student wider industry
A flexible lightweight approach likely needed
Our recommendation still formulated refined
Some likely focus opportunity offered improved data
Some focus graduate need enter marketplace best chance success
Others look understand demand different type employer might change
Finally looking accreditation might change
A degree computer science attractive Office National Statistics UK IT sector creates new job year High Fliers report note vacancy IT telecommunication graduate grown per cent since
The confirmed significant amount UK computer science research impact positively daily life
Computer science teaching university dry purely theoretical many course offer work placement learning opportunity entrepreneurship
A recent report Council Professors Heads Computing CPHC highlight breadth depth employability skill development happening university across UK including close partnership industry support course development research
Yet recent data show computer science graduate highest unemployment rate six month graduation see UK unemployment rate graph
Moreover report point industry dissatisfaction supply suitably skilled graduate computer science
So going
One view existing course often match industry demand
The rate change technology challenge university department employer
But job advert expertise specific programming language development tool necessarily signal problem given expertise one programming language easily transferred different language
Computer science fundamental provide deep undercoat latest coding language thin gloss repainted every year
Combining agility curriculum greater willingness part employer offer induction new staff could help achieve better balance underlying theory shiny new tool
The forthcoming Shadbolt Review exploring data context professional standard
Course accreditation present opportunity test refresh curriculum
One view appealing diverse range applicant computing victim success
There strong demand instance first family enter higher education
And found per cent computer science graduate black minority ethnic background compared per cent graduate overall unemployment rate BME graduate per cent compared per cent computer science graduate
This suggests current graduate recruitment practice present barrier graduate others
Another view looking wrong data
The figure often used graduate unemployment rate
If instead graduate employment rate highlighted computer science beat like physic biology hand
The difference lie number proceed study
Furthermore Higher Education Statistics Agency longitudinal data employment prospect three year instead Destinations Leavers Higher Education survey six month show computer science employment rate per cent compared overall STEM rate per cent
So problem solution far simple
Working towards solution embrace diversity offer attractive proposition including woman help employer university work together benefit everyone
The dialogue way
Student number computer science something roller coaster decade
In US longest run data available number student obtaining bachelor degree subject rose exponentially early dropping steeply rest decade
Numbers rose steeply dropped away rise
The UK record begin show similar trajectory figure total number computer science degree level examined
More recently however number fallen reflecting significant reduction student number level
The overall number undergraduate degree awarded annually climbing since risen peak
Doctorate number climbed steadily since rising falling
In US UK fluctuation closely matched trend number computer science degree proportion total number degree obtained indicating change artefact fluctuating student number overall
Directly comparable figure trend Australia available commencement degree information technology dipped early rising sharply since
One striking fact figure disparity male female participation
At doctoral level female participation US computer science study risen per cent three woman men per cent
But proportion woman earning bachelor degree subject US falling since peak per cent
In per cent
And UK proportion fallen per cent per cent
In blog launching graduate employment accreditation science technology engineering mathematics computer science consistently highest rate unemployed graduate gender difference
According Higher Education Statistics Agency per cent computer science graduate unemployed
Only one subject recorded figure higher per cent
The national average per cent
Shadbolt also note according DLHE survey per cent computer science graduate enter employment within six month leaving higher education earn le per cent electronic electrical engineering graduate per cent math graduate
When look sector industry graduate employed high proportion per cent work information communication industry
The rest dispersed across range industry unusual among many STEM discipline note
In Australia per cent IT graduate unemployed four month graduation according conducted Graduate Careers Australia
Only biology math visual performing art science recorded worse figure
But median salary recent computer science graduate A average graduate

In special used control behaviour
In fact generator
A generator similar function return array generator parameter called generates sequence value
However instead building array containing value returning generator yield value one time requires le memory allows caller get started processing first value immediately
In short generator function
Generators implemented term expressive construct
Generators also known semicoroutines special case weaker coroutines always yield control back caller passing value back rather specifying coroutine jump see
Generators usually inside loop
The first time generator invocation reached loop iterator created encapsulates state generator routine beginning argument bound corresponding
The generator body executed context iterator special action encountered time value provided action used value invocation expression
The next time generator invocation reached subsequent iteration execution generator body resumed action yet another action encountered
In addition action execution generator body also terminated action time innermost loop enclosing generator invocation terminated
In complicated situation generator may used manually outside loop create iterator used various way
Because generator compute yielded value demand useful representing sequence would expensive impossible compute
These include
infinite sequence live data stream
When eager evaluation desirable primarily sequence finite otherwise evaluation never terminate one either convert use parallel construction creates list instead generator
For example Python generator evaluated list via F evaluates lazily generator sequence evaluates eagerly list
In presence generator loop construct language reduced single loop end loop construct usual loop construct comfortably simulated using suitable generator right way
For example ranged loop like implemented iteration generator Python
Further implemented sending generator using loop
Generators first appeared prominent feature string manipulation language available later version ECMAScript language
In CLU C generator called Ruby
The final standard natively provide generator yet various library implementation exist documented
A yield statement used implement iterators data abstraction
Every expression including loop generator
The language many generator even implement logic semantics using generator mechanism OR done way
Printing square achieved using writing However time custom generator implemented suspend keyword function exactly like yield keyword CLU
As Icon every expression generator
The infinite generator prime serve example It possible introduce generator using macro
The resulting code might aspect different native
generator syntax uncluttered
A good example found
The set macro defined source allow generator defined syntax following example This iterated using Moreover allows applied class provides function
It possible write class defining iterable method iterator method class
For example possible write following program A basic range implementation would look like Perl natively provide generator support provided module us framework
Example usage In generator mechanism founded named
In model everything generator every datum created data constructor generated demand
For example list constructor operator used parenthesization
This us standard adaptor function value agreeable predicate stop requesting new value soon one encountered
The shared storage access used universal mediator Haskell
List comprehension freely used provides several related facility generator
First form work kind producer sequence also value Some sequence implemented imperatively private state variable implemented possibly infinite lazy list
Also new struct definition property specifies used sequence
But directly Racket come generator library traditional generator specification
For example Note Racket core implement powerful continuation feature providing general continuation composable also delimited continuation
Using generator library implemented Racket
The community PHP implemented generator PHP
Details found original
Ruby support generator starting version form Enumerator class
Java standard interface implementing iterators since early day since Java foreach construction make easy loop object provide interface
The collection framework typically provide iterators collection
However generator built language
This mean creating iterators often much trickier language generator especially generation logic complex
Because state must saved restored every time item yielded iterator possible store state local variable use looping routine generator available instead must manually simulated using object field hold local state loop counter
Even simple iterators built way tend significantly bulkier using generator lot
The original example could written An infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written int Iterator Also infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written using Stream interface Or get Iterator BaseStream Stream interface
An example C generator available since C version Both example utilise Generics required
It possible use multiple statement applied sequence iteration In iterators basis loop provides generator via since version
These define sequence lazily evaluated sequential access via list eagerly evaluated sequential access via array eagerly evaluated indexed access via contain code generates value
For example form sequence square number filtering number range number
Generators added version
An example generator In Python generator thought contains frozen
Whenever iterator method called Python resume frozen frame executes normally next statement reached
The generator frame frozen yielded value returned caller
PEP implemented Python add expression allowing generator delegate part operation another generator
Python syntax modeled called generator expression aid creation generator
The following extends example using generator expression compute square countfrom generator function
Harmony feature generator function
An infinite Fibonacci sequence written using function generator The iterators package used purpose

An amazing machine
We living computer age today day day activity accomplished without using computer
Sometimes knowingly sometimes unknowingly use computer
Computer become indispensable multipurpose tool
We breathing computer age gradually computer become desire necessity life difficult imagine life without

All instruction input data fed computer numeric form specifically binary form
Lots effort made last year obviate difficulty faced using machine language
The first language similar English developed known Assembly Language Symbolic Programming Languages
After High Level Languages developed bought common man computer
And main reason tremendous growth computer industry
The high level language also known Procedure Oriented Languages
The assembly language easier use compared machine la language relieved programmer burden remembering operation code address memory location
Even though assembly language proved great help programmer search continued still better language nearer conventional English language
The language developed nearer English language use writing programmer known High Level language
The different high level language used common user FORTRAN COBOL BASIC PASCAL many others
Each high level language developed fulfill basic requirement particular type problem
But development made language widen utility different purpose
The procedural nature HOW problem get coded procedure require knowledge problem solved
Contrary non procedural
That WHAT problem coded What required specified rest get done
Thus big program may get replaced single statement
The main aim cut developed maintenance time making easier user

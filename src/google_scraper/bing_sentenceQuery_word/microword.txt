In natural unit data used particular design
A word handled unit hardware processor
The number word important characteristic specific processor design
The size word reflected many aspect computer structure operation majority processor usually word sized largest piece data transferred single operation word many architecture
The largest possible size used designate location memory typically hardware word hardware word mean natural word processor opposed definition used
Modern processor including usually word size modern general purpose computer usually use bit
Special purpose digital processor instance may use size many size used historically including bit
The example system earlier word size
Several earliest computer modern well used rather plain typically word size decimal digit early fixed word length
The size word sometimes differ expected due earlier computer
If multiple compatible variation family processor share common architecture instruction set differ word size documentation software may become notationally complex accommodate difference see
Depending computer organized unit may used When computer architecture designed choice word size substantial importance
There design consideration encourage particular size particular us
address consideration point different size different us
However consideration economy design strongly push one size size related multiple fraction submultiples primary size
That preferred size becomes word size architecture
size past one influence unit address resolution choice word size
Before character often stored six bit allowed character alphabet limited upper case
Since efficient time space word size multiple character size word size period usually multiple bit binary machine
A common choice also good size numeric property floating point format
After introduction design used character supported letter standard size character accurately became eight bit
Word size thereafter naturally multiple eight bit bit commonly used
Early machine design included used often termed
In type organization numeric operand fixed length rather end detected character special marking often called encountered
Such machine often used number
This class machine included
Most machine work one unit memory time since instruction datum several unit long instruction take several cycle access memory
These machine often quite slow
For example instruction fetch take cycle read digit instruction reduced cycle cycle instruction need address field
Instruction execution took completely variable number cycle depending size operand
The memory model architecture strongly influenced word size
In particular resolution memory address smallest unit designated address often chosen word
In approach address value differ one designate adjacent memory word
This natural machine deal almost always word unit advantage allowing instruction use minimally sized field contain address permit smaller instruction size larger variety instruction
When byte processing significant part workload usually advantageous use rather word unit address resolution
This allows arbitrary character within character string addressed straightforwardly
A word still addressed address used requires bit alternative
The word size need integer multiple character size organization
This addressing approach used IBM common approach machine designed since
Individual byte accessed machine one two way
Bytes manipulated combination shift mask operation register
Moving single byte one arbitrary location another may require equivalent following Alternatively many machine implement byte operation instruction using special register memory
For example byte pointer contained size byte bit allowing byte accessed bit position byte within word word address data
Instructions could automatically adjust pointer next byte example load deposit store operation
Different amount memory used store data value different degree precision
The commonly used size usually multiple unit address resolution byte word
Converting index item array address item requires operation rather multiplication
In case relationship also avoid use division operation
As result modern computer design word size operand size power two time size byte
As computer design grown complex central importance single word size architecture decreased
Although capable hardware use wider variety size data market force exert pressure maintain extending processor capability
As result might central word size fresh design coexist alternative size original word size backward compatible design
The original word size remains available future design forming basis size family
In designed successor
They used quantity referred quantity
This contrast earlier machine natural unit addressing memory would called quantity one half word would called
In fitting scheme VAX bit
Another example family processor three different word length later released
As software routinely one next documentation define refer older thus shorter full word length CPU software may compiled
Also similar byte used small number many program shorter word bit may used context range wider word needed especially save considerable stack space cache memory space
For example Microsoft maintains definition bit despite fact API may used processor standard word size would bit respectively
Data structure containing different sized word refer byte byte byte respectively
A similar phenomenon developed support various size backward compatibility instruction set instruction mnemonic carry q identifier denoting term architecture original word size
In general new processor must use data word length virtual address width older processor older processor
Often carefully written source code written mind recompiled run variety processor even one different data word length different address width

A short macroinstruction rule specifies certain input sequence often sequence mapped replacement output sequence also often sequence character according defined procedure
The mapping process instantiates transforms macro use specific sequence known
A facility writing macro may provided part part
In former case macro used make task using application le repetitive
In latter case tool allows programmer enable even design
Macros used make sequence computing instruction available single program statement making programming task le tedious le
Thus called macro big block code expanded small sequence character
Macros often allow positional keyword parameter dictate program generates used create entire program suite according variable factor
The term derives expansion originally used generating code
allow short sequence keystroke mouse action transform usually sequence keystroke mouse action
In way frequently used repetitive sequence keystroke mouse movement
Separate program creating macro called
During macro program originally SuperKey KeyWorks Prokey popular first mean automatically format variety user input task
These program based TSR mode operation applied keyboard input matter context occurred
They extent fallen obsolescence following advent user interface availability keyboard mouse macro application making possible create keyboard macro
Keyboard macro recent time come life method exploiting economy MMORPGs
By tirelessly performing boring repetitive low risk action player running macro earn large amount game currency resource
This effect even larger player operates multiple account simultaneously operates account large amount time day
As money generated without human intervention dramatically upset economy game
For reason use macro violation MMORPGs administrator MMORPGs fight continual war identify punish macro user
Keyboard mouse macro created using application macro feature sometimes called
They created carrying sequence letting application record action
An underlying macro programming language commonly direct access feature application may also exist
The programmer text editor short editing macro follows idea conclusion
In effect editor made macro
Emacs originally devised set macro editing language later ported dialect
Another programmer text editor descendant also full implementation macro
It record register macro person type keyboard replayed edited like macro Microsoft Office
Vim also scripting language called create macro
VBA programming language included Office
However function evolved replaced macro language originally included application
access executes document opened
This make relatively easy write VBA commonly known
In became one common type computer virus
However late date patching updating program
In addition current program immediately counteract attack
Languages rudimentary macro system implemented compiler assembler
macro work simple textual token rather character level
A classic use macro computer typesetting system derivative functionality based macro
experimental system seek reconcile macro system
typed syntax macro one productive way think syntax macro
Other example Some language embedded text source code language
The mechanism code fragment recognised instance bracketed similar textual macro language much powerful fully featured language
Macros language written subset compiler executes statement compilation time output execution form part code compiled
The ability use familiar macro language give power much greater text substitution macro expense larger slower compiler
frame macro command syntax also contain text language
Each frame generic component hierarchy nested subassemblies procedure integrating subassembly frame recursive process resolve integration conflict favor higher level subassemblies
The output custom document typically compilable source module
Frame technology avoid proliferation similar subtly different component issue plagued software development since invention macro subroutine
Most assembly language le powerful procedural macro facility example allowing block code repeated N time completely different syntax actual assembly language
Macro C preprocessor described work level lexical token preserve lexical structure reliably
Syntactic macro system work instead level preserve lexical structure original program
The widely used implementation syntactic macro system found language
These language especially suited style macro due uniform parenthesized syntax known
In particular uniform syntax make easier determine invocation macro
Lisp macro transform program structure full language available express transformation
While syntactic macro often found language also available language
They also available extension

Before Lisp macro operator whose input value computed argument rather syntactic form argument whose output value used computation
In word FEXPRs implemented level EVAL provided window layer
This generally found difficult model reason effectively
In Timothy Hart proposed adding macro Lisp AI Memo MACRO Definitions LISP
In number paper introduced notion expansion system syntactic environment macro definition macro use distinct allowing macro definers user worry inadvertent variable capture cf

Hygienic macro standardized Scheme standard
The upcoming standard also include hygienic macro
A number competing implementation hygienic macro exist explicit renaming syntactic closure
Both standardized Scheme standard
Recently combined notion hygienic macro syntactic expansion time one macro system ordinary runtime another block code showed apply interleaved expansion parsing language
A number language Scheme either implement hygienic macro implement partially hygienic system
Examples include
conjecture three category make primary legitimate us macro system
Others proposed alternative us macro macro system unhygienic allow selective unhygienic transformation
The interaction macro language feature productive area research
For example useful programming interaction macro construct must defined use together
Module interact macro proposed Scheme language macro
For example language extends notion macro system syntactic tower macro written language including macro using hygiene ensure syntactic layer distinct allowing module export macro module
Macros normally used map short string macro invocation longer sequence instruction
Another le common use macro reverse map sequence instruction macro string
This approach taken Mobile Programming System used rudimentary macro compiler called SIMCMP map specific instruction set given computer counterpart macro
Applications notably compiler written macro run without change computer equipped rudimentary macro compiler
The first application run context sophisticated powerful macro compiler written macro language
This macro compiler applied fashion produce compiled much efficient version
The advantage approach complex application ported one computer different computer little effort target machine architecture writing rudimentary macro compiler
The advent modern programming language notably compiler available virtually computer rendered approach superfluous

To format drive floppy disk etc
mean prepare chosen drive used deleting data setting
The popular file system support Windows also sometimes used
In Windows formatting partition usually done tool
You also format drive using like
It might help know partition usually encompasses entire physical hard drive
That often say format drive reality formatting partition drive happens partition may whole size drive
Formatting ca usually done accident worry delete mistake
However cautious formatting anything sure know
Here common thing might related formatting Some device like camera let format storage device
It similar format hard drive using computer thing possible digital camera maybe even gaming console device might need hard drive formatted
Formatting C drive whatever letter happens identify partition Windows installed must done Windows ca erase file currently using
Doing outside OS mean file actively running therefore deleted
See instruction
If looking information formatting existing hard drive install Windows worry manually format hard drive
Formatting hard drive part clean install method installing Windows
See information
If want format device change file system say NTFS one way saving data first copy file drive empty
You might able recover file partition even formatted
Some able many free definitely worth try accidentally formatted partition held valuable data
There two different type formatting high level low level
High level formatting involves writing file system disk data organized understood software reading writing
Low level formatting track outlined disk
This done manufacturer drive even sold
The word format also used describe way thing arranged structured file system
For example format associated visible property object like text image
Word processing program like Microsoft Word example format text make centered page appear different font type
Format term used describe way file encoded organized well usually identified

Photo courtesy Philip Guo started programming I first Logo BASIC
The picture age horrible posture
By time photo taken I already written several BASIC game I distributed shareware local BBS
I fast growing bored parent software engineer gave original grad school day
That I started learning C writing simple interpreter compiler
My early interpreter BASIC time I entered high school I already created nontrivial subset Throughout high school I spent weekend coding assembly obsessed code newly released
When I started freshman year MIT computer science major I already year programming experience
So I felt right home
OK lie
With one exception That photo
When taken I even know
My parent like Quick pose front new computer Look closely
My finger even right position
My parent humanity major single programming book house
In sixth grade I tried teaching BASIC week quit hard
The real exposure I programming prior college taking AP computer science grade taught math teacher learned material
Despite shortcoming class inspired major computer science college
But I started freshman year MIT I felt bit anxious many classmate actually year childhood programming experience I le one
Even though I grow household could code way paper bag I one big thing going I I good programming
Here freshman year college Photo courtesy Philip Guo As Asian male student MIT I fit society image young programmer
Thus throughout college nobody ever said said CS student I knew Although I started complete novice like everyone I never faced impeded intellectual growth
Throughout college grad school I gradually learned via class research internship incrementally taking harder harder project getting better better programming falling deeper deeper love
Instead age I mine age
And nobody ever got way even I looked like sort person would good thing
The software engineer Tess Rinearson writes dynamic different perspective essay Instead facing implicit bias I privilege implicit endorsement
For instance whenever I attended technical meeting people would assume I knew I regardless whether I treat accordingly
If I stared someone silence nodded talking would assume I understood I clueless
Nobody ever talked I always got benefit doubt technical setting
As result I able fake till I made often landing job whose posting required skill I yet learned knew I could pick spot
Most interview research assistantships summer internship quite gave chance try
And enough round practice I actually start knowing I
As I gained experience I able land meaningful programming job led virtuous cycle improvement
For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender
This kind privilege I people looked like possessed silent manifested people said u rather say
We spend enormous amount time developing technical expertise without anyone interference implicit discouragement
Sure worked really hard effort directly translated skill improvement without much loss due interpersonal friction
Because looked part
In contrast ask computer science major majority demographic white Asian male I guarantee encountered discouraging comment You know everyone cut computer They probably still remember word action hurt even though often trying harm
For example one good friend took course freshman year enjoyed
She wanted get better Java GUI programming got summer research assistantship MIT Media Lab
However instead letting build GUI like job ad described supervisor assigned task audio clip summer long
He assigned new male student build GUI application
And like student programming also freshman amount limited experience
The student spent summer getting better GUI programming grinded away mindlessly transcribing audio
As result grew resentful shied away learning CS
Thinking story always anger
Here someone natural interest took initiative learn denied opportunity
I doubt friend could gotten good really enjoyed opportunity I
It help accepted MIT son saying Well got MIT Over decade later programming research job wish learned back college
However negative association everything hard motivate fear shot
One trite retort Well friend tougher given easily
If wanted badly enough tried even knowing might face These sort remark aggravate
Writing code living like Navy SEAL
Programming seriously demanding need superhero enter profession
Just look photo software engineering summer internship Photo courtesy Philip Guo Even though I hacking hardware simulator sound mildly I actually pretty squishy chillin cubicle often taking extended lunch break
All guy around yes programmer men exception one older woman hang u also fairly squishy
These guy made fine living good superheroes
The hardship one guy faced summer staying late playing rolling office next morning
Anyone enough practice motivation could done job programming job well
Seriously company looking hire next Steve want ship code work
It frustrates people majority demographic often need tough nail succeed field constantly bearing lasting effect thousand
according one researcher Mary Rowe In contrast people look like kinda programming work want switch later work quietly suck rock whatever
And nobody make remark appearance whether truly dedicated hacker behavior might reflect badly kind people
silent technical privilege
Ideally want spur interest young people underrepresented demographic might never otherwise think pursue CS STEM study
There great people organization working toward goal
Although I think increased broader participation critical immediate concern reducing attrition already field
For instance according That I plan start taking step encourage retain already want learn
So thought experiment For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender exact initial interest aptitude level
Would still willing devote hour deliberate practice achieve mastery face dozen hundred instance implicit discouragement would inevitably encounter year
Sure outlier would many would
Many u would quit even though potential interest thrive field
As older Black male life go extra mile reach others starting line I could prouder author empathy
I hope live future people already interest pursue CS programming field
I want people experience I privileged enough gotten college beyond unimpeded opportunity develop expertise something find beautiful practical fulfilling

The phased staged approach break manages work series distinct step completed often referred traditional
Although vary typically consists five process area four phase plus control Many industry use variation project stage uncommon stage renamed order better suit organization
For example working design construction project typically progress stage like conceptual design schematic design design development construction drawing contract document construction administration
While phased approach work well small project often result challenge failure larger project complex ambiguity risk
Lean project management us principle focus delivering value le waste reduced time
In critical study project management noted phased approach well suited project undefined ambiguous requirement high degree risk dependency technology
The explains planning made initial phase project suffers high degree uncertainty
This becomes especially true software development often realization new novel product
These complexity better handled exploratory iterative incremental approach

For project conceptual design operation final product may performed concurrent project planning activity may help inform planning team identifying deliverable planning activity

The phase ensures project management plan deliverable executed accordingly
This phase involves proper allocation management human resource resource material budget
The output phase project deliverable
Documenting everything within project key successful
In order maintain budget scope effectiveness pace project must physical document pertaining specific task
With correct documentation easy see whether project requirement met
To go along documentation provides information regarding already completed project
Documentation throughout project provides paper trail anyone need go back reference work past
In case documentation successful way monitor control specific phase project
With correct documentation project success tracked observed project go
If performed correctly documentation backbone project success
Monitoring controlling consists process performed observe project execution potential problem identified timely manner corrective action taken necessary control execution project
The key benefit project performance observed measured regularly identify variance project management
Monitoring controlling includes In project monitoring control process also provides feedback project phase order implement corrective preventive action bring project compliance project management plan
Project maintenance ongoing process includes In stage pay attention effectively quickly user problem resolved
Over course construction project work scope may change
Change normal expected part construction process
Changes result necessary design modification differing site condition material availability change value engineering impact third party name
Beyond executing change field change normally need documented show actually constructed
This referred change management
Hence owner usually requires final record show change specifically change modifies tangible portion finished work
The record made contract document usually necessarily limited design drawing
The end product effort industry term drawing simply built
The requirement providing norm construction contract
Construction document management highly important task undertaken aid online desktop software system maintained physical documentation
The increasing legality pertaining construction industry maintenance correct documentation caused increase need document management system
When change introduced project viability project

Project control begin early project planning end late project review thorough involvement step process
Projects may audited reviewed project progress
Formal audit generally risk management direct objective audit
An examination may include comparison approved project management process project actually managed
Each project assessed appropriate level control needed much control time consuming little control risky
If project control implemented correctly cost business clarified term error fix
Control system needed cost quality communication time change procurement human resource
In addition auditor consider important project reliant stakeholder control many control exist
Auditors review development process procedure implemented
The process development quality final product may also assessed needed requested
A business may want auditing firm involved throughout process catch problem earlier fixed easily
An auditor serve control consultant part development team independent auditor part audit
Businesses sometimes use formal system development process
These help assure system developed successfully

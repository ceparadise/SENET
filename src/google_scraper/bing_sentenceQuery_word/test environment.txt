code repository version control system old version maintained error backed system help group developer work project
These tool may include simple communication tool email provide thing like distributed pair programming
database system hold necessary data used program
Sometimes database also used store fragment program
The database might also contain required test data assure correct thing built
Likewise might contain information success failure test run documentation system used either program documentation use team user documentation give instruction effective use system way make interaction file system easy efficient directory listing let easily file way maintain various configuration file system tailored various us way keep tool updated easily automatic error checker style checker beyond provided compiler For kind software sophisticated emulation environment check interaction various component
Mobile apps often need server way test interaction example
An Integrated Development Environment say Eclipse NetBeans integrate single program may use one window provide visual representation tool
A good one tailorable language need without cluttering workspace
A le integrated system Emacs say provides thing possibly cryptic user command
An IDE requires learning process pay dividend flexible restricted single language architecture
But even simple text editor compiler testing development environment many year available
Way back card punch
Note file project necessarily text
Some project require example graphical file show design
I claim I complete list
There many possibility
Each person development environment personal
It good make productive le frustrated
Is subject update modification time learn new tool technique
Also note needed every project need proficient many get started
But issue arise work may help see need expand personal set
In industry DEV environment developer free play break anything provided fix follow
A typical enterprise shop DEV PROD environment developer access DEV nearly unlimited PROD limited end user support without significant layer management pope
DEV typically mirror prod closely enough practical purpose underpowered reflect lesser usage

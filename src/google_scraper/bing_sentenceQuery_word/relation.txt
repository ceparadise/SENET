Computer science within purview study theory design implementation performance computer computer software including study computability computation
In ACM IEEE say Computer science span wide range theoretical algorithmic foundation development robotics computer vision intelligent system bioinformatics exciting area
We think work computer scientist falling three category
They design implement software
Computer scientist take challenging programming job
They also supervise programmer keeping aware new approach
They devise new way use computer
Progress CS area networking database enabled development World Wide Web
Now CS researcher working scientist field make robot become practical intelligent aide use database create new knowledge use computer help decipher secret DNA
They develop effective way solve computing problem
For example computer scientist develop best possible way store information database send data network display complex image
Their theoretical background allows determine best performance possible study algorithm help develop new approach provide better performance
Computer science span range theory programming
Curricula reflect breadth sometimes criticized failing prepare graduate specific job

Information system specialist focus integrating information technology solution business process meet information need business enterprise enabling achieve objective effective efficient way
This discipline perspective information technology emphasizes information view technology instrument generating processing distributing information
Professionals discipline primarily concerned information computer system provide aid enterprise defining achieving goal process enterprise implement improve using information technology
A majority Information Systems IS program located business school
All IS degree combine business computing coursework
A variety IS program exist various label often reflect nature program
For example program Computer Information Systems usually strongest technology focus program Management Information Systems emphasize organizational behavioral aspect IS
Degree program name always consistent
A fourth area campus New Media computing discipline rather overlap computing user computer technology The New Media Program University Maine offer interdisciplinary course study system technology history design theory information
The curriculum enables student investigate creative applied process essential area study
It prepares student technologically capable articulate thinker creative medium professional
UMaine New Media Web site There confusion another area computing information technology
Note information technology IT differs meaning term used UMaine Strategic Plan author essentially mean The ACM IEEE differentiate IS IT follows
Whereas perspective IS emphasizes information technology viewed instrument generating processing distributing information Information Technology emphasize technology information conveys
IT new rapidly growing field started grassroots response practical everyday need business organization
Today organization every kind dependent information technology
They need appropriate system place
These system must work properly secure upgraded maintained replaced appropriate
Employees throughout organization require support IT staff understand computer system software committed solving whatever problem might
Graduates information technology program address need
Degree program information technology arose degree program computing discipline producing adequate supply graduate capable handling real need
IT program exist produce graduate posse right combination knowledge practical expertise take care organization information technology infrastructure people use
IT specialist assume responsibility selecting hardware software product appropriate organization integrating product organizational need infrastructure installing customizing maintaining application organization computer user
Examples responsibility include installation network network administration security design web page development multimedia resource installation communication component oversight email system planning management technology lifecycle organization technology maintained upgraded replaced
Information technology represented UMaine campus
There fact question suitability major university opposed technical college campus
There additional confusion term information This original sense refers specific field study property information per se example Shannon work information theory
The term sometimes used synonymously computing come mean academic study information representation storage use opposed addition computational manipulation information
The School Computing Information Science home information science UMaine
In addition computer science School strong emphasis information science research graduate education particular area geographical information science

If two set A B refer Cartesian Product A x B
This mean A B b c A x B
It set pair value first A second B
A relation A B subset A x B
A relation said connect value together way showing relationship
As example let take two set
A B
Because two set say relation A
Now consider relation described greater
We start looking A x B
Now relation R subset
One way work relation look value turn
So look first value
The first value second value relation greater
This true part relation
The true say greater say greater
But get see yes greater value relation
In end find relation subset A x B
We show digraph follows say b related R arrow going b
If related b relation R also say aRb
So case
There number different property relation
Let R subset A x R said reflexive true every possible value A true aRa
This mean everything map onto
On digraph shown fact every node loop attached point back
An example relation type could height Everything height still height thing
The key feature though aRa always true
R said transitive true every possible value b c A aRb true bRc true must case aRc true
An example kind relation smaller
If object smaller b object b smaller c obviously object must smaller object This hard spot digraph basically whenever arrow b arrow b c also arrow R said symmetric relation work backwards
For example two node relation b true aRb relation symmetric must also true bRa
height good example symmetric relation If height b obviously b height true object
On digraph shown fact wherever arrow two node another one going opposite direction
R said antisymmetric true b A aRb bRa must equal ie
relation work reverse two node
An equivalence relation relation reflexive symmetric transitive
To show look three feature show The idea equivalence relation aRb b sense
This usually divide set A seperate part
The idea part contains element equivalent b part aRb
So let assume A set natural number R relation state b equal mod
true true etc
true true etc
The digraph look like So see continued would partition odd number even number
The odd number equivalent relation even number equivalent relation
We say divided two class
We talk class set node equivalent
So case set set
This way see set natural number N consists element partition exactly
N
Similarly say conjunction always equal empty set value also appear
In fact equivalence relation following true A partition set subset make set
For example set partition make set There number operation possible relation set
Let relation A The union described set theory every pair thing either
For example family take union relation mother father get relation parent
The intersection described set theory every pair thing
For example intersection relation mother father empty nobody mother father child
The complement described R basically set pair A x A
For example inverse parent parent The inverse described R every pair backwards
For example relation true R
For example inverse parent child
If consider two relation parent mother define another relation grandmother combining finding value mother b b parent Then grandmother In general two relation A B B C relational composition described relation A C b B
For relation R property P say relation S P closure R S property P R another relation property P R subset R S subset R well
For example let assume P property transitivity
The P closure R transitive closure When P reflexivity known reflexive closure P symmetry known symmetric closure
The P closure constructed adding R minimum number pair b make new relation property For example let u consider relation consisting
The reflexive closure relation consisting
All added minimum pair required make reflexive
All rest left alone
The transitive closure harder find
But consider pair pair turn see way get straight
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
needed
needed already
And
The transitive closure relation
The symmetric closure much easier minimum pair ensure every pair work backwards
In case
We added
Another common type relation set relation share property le equal
Such relation called order relation
The simplest kind order relation called partial order follows A partial order relation R reflexive antisymmetric transitive
A partially ordered set poset additional property
Namely integer x either x le equal le equal x
We say two integer comparable relationship le equal
A partial order relation two element comparable called total order
Given ordering set define maximal minimal element
An element poset A partial order said least element element
An element poset A partial order said greatest element element
A minimal element partial order set A element b b
A maximal element partial order set A element b b
In basic term minimal element one another element smaller maximal element element another element bigger
That say minimal element smallest maximal element biggest two element may comparable partial order
A partial order lot minimal maximal element
In general poset A drawn partial order placing larger element top le large element
Draw minimum number line x le sequence line descending x
This called Hasse Diagram
And basically know relation
I recommend reading page note order relation minimal maximal element partial order stuff make tiny bit sense

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Not sure question relation physic computer science
A lot physicist also computer scientist vice versa
My professor PhD Physics Computer Science professor
Whats relation
Why common
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
First physic tends provide good background people move study problem area perhaps lot computer science
However also number area interface computer science physic attract people side Of perhaps last one TCS seems surprising
However recent year significant success applying idea thermodynamics statistical mechanic problem computational complexity
An example would algorithm work extremely well optimization problem well work done phase transition
From reasoning knowledge one CS professor PhD astronomy Above What mean computer scientist
Someone research computer science department
Or perhaps artificial intelligence algorithm development grid computing commercial company
Or mean people study thing pure computer scientist might different setting perhaps biology physic The last part ambiguous You probably mean Why physic doctorate computer science common
could also mean Why CS professor degree physic common
The computer science professor I mentioned described learning cost bug program They astronomy graduate student would write complex program Fortran simulation sun core print punched card
They would take card specific order
computer desk located bunker underneath main building university
Perhaps day later would come back receive output queued program
If anything wrong output perhaps halted error shame would go entire program figure went wrong
Thus learned meticulously debug program paper really way time I suppose since could use mainframe run program head
However professor technically lecturer teach Java web development class course building computer sigh I think used get keep build introductory database class
So talking professor loosely background probably determine kind class teach
I think main reason common many people tenured professor age graduate school college offered computer science
So back people interested theoretical computer science got doctorate Mathematics people interested applied computer science got degree field natural science
Since physic offer readily answerable question computationally particularly computational power available many applied computer scientist ended physic program
When school began offer full bachelor master doctoral program computer science people returned first love
I gathered talking CS professor I undergrad followed exactly path describe
I pretty sure lot physic computer science professorship vice versa even though I sure exception I get several comment pointing
I realize lot overlap two field want know real reason many CS physic
I
CS
Physics astro experience intersection usually originate least two area
First many field Physics experiment simulation produce large quantity data eg
SDSS dataset many TBs produce astrophysics large collider LHC particle physic
When dealing storage processing large datasets physicist get involved CS u enjoy
Second field called complex system spin glass stock market modeled effectively computer hence computer program becomes experiment
Complex system exciting field physicist fairly simple system eg
pendelum produce complex behaviour relatively cheap research PCs cheap software free found many field physic
A lot physical modeling done computer program
Physics based creating mathematical picture way universe work
Physics really build logic integral computer science
I think blog post sum nicely say Without algorithm would Physics
Physics built fundamental assumption model world using algorithm
Computer Science fundamental natural science
A lot thing common

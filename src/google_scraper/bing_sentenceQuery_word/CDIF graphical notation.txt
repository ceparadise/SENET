This first three post series
The second post talk
The third article talk
notation used really scary concept
I thought real programmer talked code
It scary academic description made little sense
This frustrating underlying concept actually hard
Simply put notation programmer talk algorithm
Algorithms another scary topic I cover another post purpose let say algorithm mean function program far
A function notation determined responds different input
How much slower give list thing work instead list thing
Consider code So call function like pretty quick
We loop thing list find first argument function return True
If get end find return False
The complexity function
I explain mean second let break mathematical syntax
read Order N function also known Order function
I think approximation deal order magnitude
Orders magnitude mathematical term basically tell difference class number
Think difference
If picture closest friend people really big difference
Similarly difference pretty big fact difference junker car lightly used one
It turn approximation long within order magnitude pretty close
If guess number gumballs machine within order magnitude said gumballs
gumballs would
A gumball machine whose number gumballs probably within order magnitude
Back dissecting say graph time take run function different sized input
array item item item etc see approximately corresponds number item array
This called linear graph
This mean line basically straight graph
Some may caught code sample item always first item list code would really fast
This true approximate performance something
The worst case code thing searching list
Note The math term upper bound mean talking mathematic limit awfulness
If wanted see graph function ignore function change variable
You type Wolfram Alpha plot x show diagonal line
The reason swap n x graphing program want variable name corresponds x axis
The getting bigger left right corresponds giving bigger bigger array function
The represents time higher line slower
Runtime characteristic O n function So example
Consider function This bit silly example bear
This function called called constant time
What mean matter big input always take amount time compute thing
If go back Wolfram see always stay matter far right go
If pas list million integer take time going pas list integer
Constant time considered best case scenario function
Runtime characteristic O function Consider function This match every item list every item list
If gave array get back
This part field mathematical field study combination thing
This function algorithm want sound fancy considered
This every item list aka input size operation
So
Below comparison graph reference
You see function get slow quickly something operates constant time much better
This particularly useful come data structure I post soon
Comparison O n v O n v O function This pretty high level overview notation hopefully get acquainted topic
There give depth view topic warned hop mathematic notation quickly
If anything make sense send
I also written
I thinking writing book topic
If something like see please express interest

mathematical notation describes argument tends towards particular value infinity
It member family notation invented others collectively called
In big O notation used according running time space requirement grow input size grows
In big O notation often used express bound difference better understood approximation famous example difference remainder term
Big O notation characterizes function according growth rate different function growth rate may represented using O notation
The letter O used growth rate function also referred
A description function term big O notation usually provides growth rate function
Associated big O notation several related notation using symbol describe kind bound asymptotic growth rate
Big O notation also used many field provide similar estimate
Let two function defined subset
One writes positive constant sufficiently large value absolute value multiplied absolute value
That exists positive real number real number In many context assumption interested growth rate variable go infinity left unstated one writes simply The notation also used describe behavior near real number often say exist positive number If value definition unified using In typical usage formal definition notation used directly rather notation function derived following simplification rule For example let suppose wish simplify function using notation describe growth rate approach infinity
This function sum three term
Of three term one highest growth rate one largest exponent function namely
Now one may apply second rule product first factor depend
Omitting factor result simplified form
Thus say
Mathematically write
One may confirm calculation using formal definition let
Applying statement equivalent expansion suitable choice
To prove let
Then Big O notation two main area application In application function appearing within typically chosen simple possible omitting constant factor lower order term
There two formally close noticeably different usage notation This distinction application principle formal definition big O case different limit function argument
Big O notation useful efficiency
For example time number step take complete problem size might found
As grows large come dominate term instance term time large term
Ignoring latter would negligible effect expression value purpose
Further become irrelevant compare expression expression containing term
Even latter always exceed former grows larger
Additionally number step depends detail machine model algorithm run different type machine typically vary constant factor number step needed execute algorithm
So big O notation capture remains write either say algorithm time complexity
Note meant express equal normal mathematical sense rather colloquial second expression sometimes considered accurate see discussion first considered
Big O also used describe approximation mathematical function
The significant term written explicitly term summarized single big O term
Consider example two expression valid small The second expression one mean error constant time close enough
If function written finite sum function fastest growing one determines order
For example In particular function may bounded polynomial tends one may disregard term polynomial
Another thing notice set different
If greater one latter grows much faster
A function grows faster called
One grows slowly exponential function form called
An algorithm require time superpolynomial subexponential example include fastest known algorithm function
We may ignore power inside logarithm
The set log exactly log
The logarithm differ constant factor since log log thus big O notation ignores
Similarly log different constant base equivalent
On hand exponential different base order
For example order
Changing unit may may affect order resulting algorithm
Changing unit equivalent multiplying appropriate variable constant wherever appears
For example algorithm run order replacing mean algorithm run order big O notation ignores constant
This written O
If however algorithm run order replacing give
This equivalent general
Changing variable may also affect order resulting algorithm
For example algorithm run time measured term number input number run time log measured function input number log
This implies mean
Big little Ω also used multiple variable
To define Big formally multiple variable suppose two function defined subset
We say Equivalently condition replaced condition denotes
For example statement asserts exist constant defined Note definition allows coordinate increase infinity
In particular statement quite different
Note definition subset function defined significant generalizing statement univariate setting multivariate setting
For example restrict defined
This generalization big O multivariate function practice inconsistency choice definition
The statement defined usually written
Some consider since use equal sign could misleading suggests symmetry statement
As say true
describes statement equality since side could reversed could deduce ridiculous thing like identity
For reason would precise use write thinking class function constant
However use equal sign customary
Knuth pointed mathematician customarily use sign use word English Aristotle man man necessarily Aristotle
Big O notation also used conjunction arithmetic operator complicated equation
For example denotes collection function growth plus part whose growth limited
Thus express Suppose developed operate set element
Its developer interested finding function express long algorithm take run arbitrary measurement time term number element input set
The algorithm work first calling subroutine sort element set perform operation
The sort known time complexity subroutine run algorithm must take additional step terminates
Thus overall time complexity algorithm expressed
Here term subsumed within
Again usage disregard formal meaning symbol allow one use big O notation kind convenient placeholder
In complicated usage appear different place equation even several time side
For example following true The meaning statement follows function satisfy left side function satisfying right side substituting function equation make two side equal
For example third equation mean For function function
In term set notation meaning class function represented left side subset class function represented right side
In use formal symbol unlike usual use
Thus example imply false statement Big O consists uppercase O
Unlike notation need special symbol
Yet commonly used calligraphic variant like available derived typesetting system
Here list class function commonly encountered analyzing running time algorithm
In case positive constant increase without bound
The function generally listed first
The statement sometimes weakened derive simpler formula asymptotic complexity
For subset may considered polynomial bigger order
Big commonly used asymptotic notation comparing function
Here define related notation term Big progressing family notation Big notation belongs
Intuitively assertion read mean grows much faster
This often written le frequently set notation
Formally mean every positive constant exists constant Note difference earlier notation present definition former true constant latter must hold positive constant however small
In way notation make corresponding notation every function also every function also
For example
If nonzero least becomes nonzero beyond certain point relation equivalent notation common mathematics rarer computer science
respect number arithmetic operation
For example It also satisfies transitivity relation There two widespread incompatible definition statement real number real function defined neighbourhood positive neighbourhood
The first one chronologically used one
When two subject meet situation bound generate confusion
In introduced new symbol defined follows Thus negation
In author introduced two new symbol thus defined Hence negation negation
Although wrote otherwise use three symbol meaning
These symbol prototype Landau never used exactly thus
These three symbol well meaning satisfied currently used
We precisely We precisely however In published paper justify use describe stronger property
Knuth wrote For application I seen far computer science stronger requirement much appropriate
He defined comment Although I changed Hardy Littlewood definition I feel justified definition mean wide use way say want say comparatively rare case definition applies
The limit definition assume sufficiently large
The table sorted smallest largest sense O Θ version Ω ω function correspond real line
Computer science us big Big Theta Θ little little omega ω Knuth big Omega Ω notation
Analytic number theory often us big small big Omega Ω notation
The small omega ω notation used often analysis
Informally especially computer science Big notation often permitted somewhat abused describe asymptotic tight bound using Big Theta Θ notation might factually appropriate given context
For example considering function following generally acceptable tighter bound number usually strongly preferred looser bound number
The equivalent English statement respectively So three statement true progressively information contained
In field however big O notation number list would used commonly Big Theta notation bullet number list
For example represents running time newly developed algorithm input size inventor user algorithm might inclined put upper asymptotic bound long take run without making explicit statement lower asymptotic bound
In book consider set function function belongs satisfies In correct notation set instance called The author state use equality operator denote set membership rather set membership operator abuse notation advantage
Inside equation inequality use asymptotic notation stand anonymous function set eliminates term help reduce inessential clutter equation example Another notation sometimes used computer science Õ read shorthand log
Essentially big O notation ignoring logarithmic factor effect function indicate explosion input parameter important predicting bad performance effect contributed factor
This notation often used obviate nitpicking within stated tightly bounded matter hand since log always constant ε
Also defined convenient function term
The generalization function taking value straightforward replacing absolute value norm need take value space
A generalization function taking value also possible
The limiting process also generalized introducing arbitrary
directed
The notation used define quite general space also asymptotical equivalence function restrictive notion relationship Θ
It reduces lim positive real valued function
For example Θ
The symbol O first introduced number theorist second volume book first volume yet containing big O notation published
The number theorist adopted thus inspired introduce notation hence called Landau symbol
These notation used applied mathematics asymptotic analysis
The symbol sense introduced Hardy Littlewood
Hardy Littlewood also introduced symbol right left precursor modern symbol smaller small larger small
Thus Omega symbol original meaning sometimes also referred Landau symbol
This notation became commonly used number theory least since
In big O popularized computer science introduced related Theta notation proposed different definition Omega notation
Landau never used Big Theta small omega symbol
Hardy symbol term modern notation Hardy however never defined used notation sometimes reported
It also noted Hardy introduces symbol well symbol tract Orders Infinity make use three paper
In nearly remaining paper book consistently us Landau symbol O Hardy notation used anymore
On hand Russian number theorist introduced notation increasingly used number theory instead notation
We frequently notation used paper
The originally stand order Ordnung Bachmann thus Latin letter
Neither Bachmann Landau ever call Omicron
The symbol much later viewed Knuth capital probably reference definition symbol
The digit used

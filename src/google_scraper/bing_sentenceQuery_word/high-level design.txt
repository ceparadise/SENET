HLD explains architecture would used developing software product
The architecture diagram provides overview entire system identifying main component would developed product interface
The HLD us possibly nontechnical mildly technical term understandable administrator system
In contrast expose logical detailed design element programmer
In case design complete view entire system breaking smaller part easily understood
To minimize maintenance overhead construction proceeds design done best design elaborated degree needed satisfy need
A design document HLDD add necessary detail current project description represent suitable model coding
This document includes architecture diagram depicting structure system database architecture application architecture layer application flow navigation security architecture technology architecture
A design provides overview system product service process
Such overview help supporting component compatible others
The design briefly describe platform system product service process depends include important change need made
In addition brief consideration significant commercial legal environmental security safety technical risk issue assumption
The idea mention every work area briefly clearly delegating ownership detailed design activity whilst also encouraging effective collaboration various project team
Today design require contribution number expert representing many distinct professional discipline
Finally every type identified design contributing design give due consideration customer experience

In strong detail
In comparison may use element easier use may automate even hide entirely significant area computing system
making process developing program simpler understandable relative language
The amount abstraction provided defines programming language
In programming language using commonly called
Examples autocodes
The first programming language designed computer created
However implemented time original contribution due largely isolated development although influenced language Superplan degree also Algol
The first really widespread language machine independent development IBM earlier system
defined committee European American computer scientist introduced well
It also first language clear distinction corresponding
Algol also introduced several concept construct first described formal method BNF
During roughly period introduced also called structs introduced fully general programming language first time
language refers higher level abstraction
Rather dealing register memory address call stack language deal variable array complex arithmetic boolean expression subroutine function loop lock abstract computer science concept focus optimal program efficiency
Unlike language language element translate directly machine native
Other feature string handling routine language feature file may also present
One thing note programming language language allows programmer detached separated machine
That unlike language like assembly machine language programming amplify programmer instruction trigger lot data movement background without knowledge
The responsibility power executing instruction handed machine programmer
language intend provide feature standardize common task permit rich debugging maintain architectural agnosticism language often produce efficient code optimization specific system architecture
border prevents programming technique applied situation computational limitation standard conformance physical constraint require access architectural resource fi response time hardware integration
programming exhibit feature like generic data interpretation intermediate code file often result execution far operation necessary higher memory consumption larger binary program size
For reason code need run particularly quickly efficiently may require use language even language would make coding easier
In many case critical portion program mostly language leading much faster efficient simply reliably functioning
However growing complexity modern architecture compiler language frequently produce code comparable efficiency programmer produce hand higher abstraction may allow powerful technique providing better overall result counterpart particular setting
language designed independent specific computing system architecture
This facilitates executing program written language computing system compatible support Interpreted program
language improved designer develop improvement
In case new language evolve one others goal aggregating popular construct new improved feature
An example maintains backward compatibility mean program library written Java continue usable even programming shop switch Scala make transition easier lifespan coding indefinite
In contrast program rarely survive beyond system architecture written without major revision
This engineering Penalty
Examples programming language active use today include many others
The term inherently relative
Some decade ago similar language often considered supported concept expression evaluation recursive function data type structure considered
Today many programmer might refer C lack large garbage collection etc
basically support scalar operation provides direct memory addressing
It therefore readily blend assembly language machine level
Assembly language may regarded higher level often still used without representation support concept constant limited expression sometimes even variable procedure
turn inherently slightly higher level used internally many processor
There three general mode execution modern language Note language strictly interpreted language compiled language
Rather implementation language behavior use interpretation compilation
For example interpreted even though typically compiled
Similarly Java show difficulty trying apply label language rather implementation Java compiled bytecode bytecode subsequently executed either interpretation compilation typically compiler JVM
Moreover compilation interpretation strictly limited description compiler artifact binary executable IL assembly
Alternatively possible language directly implemented computer computer directly executes HLL code
This known designed targeted specific language

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

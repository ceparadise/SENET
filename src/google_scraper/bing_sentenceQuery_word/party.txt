Go UCI
Maybe bit biased CS undergrad factor
This may affect decision made big CS curriculum change Java Python starting language lot people like decision
As noted UC Davis seems ranked higher UC Irvine one ranking yet UC Irvine ranked slightly higher another ranking
The conclusion
Badreddin make good point UC Davis closer Silicon Valley
At time close big tech company office Socal growing small startup scene Los Angeles area
The big tech company really discriminate Norcal Socal probably fewer startup internship opportunity SoCal also probably le competition startup internship opportunity Socal
With mind I believe tech big SV clear difference decision
Ultimately key thing realize slight difference academic career opportunity going determine satisfaction college
Focus quality life overall vibe school social vibe thing like surrounding area culture student body
Long forgotten everything learned school long dropped college internship resume still friend memory social skill gained college
I like add taken advising go super fun party school
That kind scene right fit lot people
Still question

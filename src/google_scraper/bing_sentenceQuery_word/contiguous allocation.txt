Contiguous memory allocation classical memory allocation model assigns process consecutive memory block memory block consecutive address
Contiguous memory allocation one oldest memory allocation scheme
When process need execute memory requested process
The size process compared amount contiguous main memory available execute process
If sufficient contiguous memory found process allocated memory start execution
Otherwise added queue waiting process sufficient free contiguous memory available
The contiguous memory allocation scheme implemented operating system help two register known base limit register
When process executing main memory base register contains starting address memory location process executing amount byte consumed process stored limit register
A process directly refer actual address corresponding memory location
Instead us relative address respect base register
All address referred program considered virtual address
The CPU generates logical virtual address converted actual address help memory management unit MMU
The base address register used address translation MMU
Thus physical address calculated follows The address memory location referenced process checked ensure refer address neighboring process
This processing security handled underlying operating system
One disadvantage contiguous memory allocation degree multiprogramming reduced due process waiting free memory

Just like title contiguous memory block
One without gap address occupies
You probably think block think something gap middle two block
The term come definition array contiguous
That mean element laid discontinuity padding may padding inside element element
So array element look like underscore character per byte symbol represent memory It look like And neither look like In case look like mean far address visible C concerned
Something could contiguous virtual address space contiguous physical RAM
For matter something could contiguous physical RAM address space actually adjacent physical RAM
Half could one RAM chip half another RAM chip
But C memory model ca see
This contiguous memory block five byte spanning location location It represents byte light blue together memory gap byte white
This set five byte interest It fragmented three group byte yellow starting location gap byte present group
The gap byte location
A block memory interrupted memory
Or precise requires uninterrupted block virtual
The real RAM backing address space need contiguous
This important allocate large memory block
The OS give contiguous block memory fragmented smaller piece free memory allocation satisfied even total free memory larger requested space
This big problem bit apps since address space large
But bit process happen heap get fragmented freed block still unfreed block larger allocation fail
Answering context allocating memory invoke memory allocator request byte memory must able locate single block least byte unallocated memory
If byte memory starting one address another byte starting address would create gap allocator satisfy request byte even though total byte free

All file system I know make significant effort try allocate file contiguous bloc disk
But disk SSD using flash technology underneath benefit contiguous allocation
The benefit I see file system like use extent case contiguous allocation beneficial simply let u describe file layout succinctly seems like fairly minor advantage
I guess another way write question SSDs still perform better sequential read writes scattered read writes

Contiguous mean immediately adjacent
For example contiguous sector come one
Frequently stored disk become fragmented mean stored sector

I want better understand OS provides heap memory process
Here heap memory I mean memory allocated dynamically say call
Heap allocator typically call system call reserve region page dole chunk call
The system call Unix used implementation sometimes use well
I think window us totally clear
A good resource
Short answer summarizing answer It done operating system
Simple early operating system assigned fixed size area code data stack heap idea stack heap grew towards
Early Unix system space stack area data used also heap could extended specialized system call
More modern system use virtual memory bound limited contiguous address space anymore
So program ask extra address usually via similar library handling heap dole part asked
How exactly work depends programming language different language pose different requirement facility underlying kernel offer
To answer question short answer yes
The long answer executable linked also field executable header For Unix operating system
Windows us
determine initial size static data area stack heap
For question short answer depends
Since modern operating system today use virtual memory common use Virtual Memory Addressing program given separate memory space
The size memory space either system system
A good discussion layout running program Linux
A request operating system map page extend range valid address program use
These new range backed physical RAM swapped disk
With said program type fixed size
For example old era something known COre iMage file executable allocated fixed
Although nature machine back day COM file could access entire memory map machine without consequence
Other machine type different version
Current Unix implementation however support ELF executable type possibly others
Executable script file equivalent file Windows use interpreter ELF binary

What meaning contiguous memory
It mean memory allocated single chunk
This often used talking container
For instance class use contiguous chunk memory
This mean vector contains element assured get pointer first element vector incrementing pointer access second element incrementing access last element
The deque class hand guarantee contiguous storage
This mean deque contains element get pointer first element certain access second element incrementing pointer third incrementing
Another example data structure would linked list
With linked list almost unthinkable incrementing head pointer could return second element
It rarely relevant assuming use good practice using iterators instead pointer much let collection manage store item without worry
Usually need memory contiguous call C code code C function designed work contiguous memory simplest way
If write following statement reserving contiguous memory cell type integer
So say integer reserve byte memory address first memory cell The address arr memory The address arr memory The address arr memory They contiguous one another
But write reserving memory cell
So address may far away b For example The address memory The address b memory The address c memory They contiguous
That First contiguous memory mean chunk memory allocated without gap address occupies
It one single block memory
Contiguous memory would mean various way allocating contiguous memory
One simple way array C STL container like would also allocate contiguous memory

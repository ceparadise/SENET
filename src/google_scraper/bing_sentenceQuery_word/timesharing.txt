In sharing computing resource among many user mean time
Its introduction emergence prominent model computing represented major technological shift history computing
By allowing large number user interact single computer dramatically lowered cost providing computing capability made possible individual organization use computer without owning one promoted interactive use computer development new interactive
The earliest computer extremely expensive device slow comparison later model
Machines typically dedicated particular set task operated control panel operator manually entering small program via switch order load run series program
These program might take hour even week run
As computer grew speed run time dropped soon time taken start next program became concern
methodology evolved decrease dead period queuing program soon one program completed next would start
To support batch processing operation number comparatively inexpensive writer used programmer write program offline
When typing punching complete program submitted operation team scheduled run
Important program started quickly long le important program started unpredictable
When program run finally completed output generally printed returned programmer
The complete process might take day time programmer might never see computer
The alternative allowing user operate computer directly generally far expensive consider
This user might long period entering code computer remained idle
This situation limited interactive development organization could afford waste computing cycle large university part
Programmers university decried behavior batch processing imposed point Stanford student made short film humorously critiquing
They experimented new way interact directly computer field today known
developed realization single user would make inefficient use computer large group user together would
This due pattern interaction Typically individual user entered burst information followed long pause group user working would mean pause one user would filled activity others
Given optimal group size overall process could efficient
Similarly small slice time spent waiting disk tape network input could granted user
The concept claimed first described summer session MIT later article How consider computer
In paper published December Bauer wrote The computer would handle number problem concurrently
Organizations would equipment installed premise would buy time computer much way average household buy power water utility company
Implementing system able take advantage initially difficult
Batch processing effectively methodological development top earliest system
Since computer still ran single program single user time primary change batch processing time delay one program next
Developing system supported multiple user time completely different concept
The state user program would kept machine switched quickly
This would take computer cycle slow machine era concern
However computer rapidly improved speed especially size user state retained continually decreased relatively speaking
The first project implement system initiated MIT initially planned modified later additionally modified one first computer powerful enough
One deliverable project known CTSS demonstrated November
CTSS good claim first system remained use
Another contender first demonstrated system II created public demonstration near University Illinois early
But special purpose system
Bitzer long said PLATO project would gotten patent University Illinois lost patent year
began service January
The first commercially successful system
Throughout late multiplexed onto large institutional system many implementation sequentially polled terminal see whether additional data available action requested computer user
Later technology interconnection driven used parallel data transfer technology standard
Generally computer terminal utilized college property much place found today
In earliest day personal computer many fact used particularly smart terminal system
The Dartmouth Time Sharing System creator wrote response time average second destroys illusion one computer
Conversely timesharing user thought terminal computer
With rise microcomputing early faded background individual microprocessor sufficiently inexpensive single person could dedicated solely need even idle
However Internet brought general concept back popularity
Expensive corporate server farm costing million host thousand customer sharing common resource
As early serial terminal web site operate primarily burst activity followed period idle time
This bursting nature permit service used many customer usually perceptible communication delay unless server start get busy
In several company started providing service
Early system used KSR ASR Teletype Model KSR ASR machine environment terminal especially two different code
They would connect Bell modem operating character per second
Later terminal modem supported character per second
The system would provide complete operating environment including variety programming language processor various software package file storage bulk printing storage
Users charged rent terminal charge hour connect time charge second CPU time charge disk storage
Common system used included
Companies providing service included GEISCO subsidiary The founded founded bought Dun Bradstreet Dial Data bought Tymshare BBN
By service bureau serving US NIH alone
The list different timesharing service using equipment
An example bureau business OLS Computer Services UK Ltd
Previously Leasco Response later acquired Systems Pittsburgh PA company operated four TSB Time shared Basic system Knightsbridge later Islington headquarters offering business package well raw time university
In addition HP estate DEC operated processor FEP connecting UK user DEC based US
Connectivity provided via leased Westrex ASR Data Dynamics enabled teletype machine connected via Post Office ex GPO type modem acoustic coupler connecting telephone handset operating
In said one major computer manufacturer The biggest market currently
For DEC second largest computer company IBM also true Their IBM widely used commercial timesharing service CompuServe Systems OLS Rapidata
Although many service simply closed Rapidata held became part National Data Corporation
It still sufficient interest focus A User Guide Statistics Programs The Rapidata Timesharing System
Even revenue fell National Data subsequently developed problem attempt made keep timesharing business going
Beginning operating system designed modeled electrical telephone utility
In original hypertext repository envisioned service
It seemed computer industry grew consolidation computing resource would occur timesharing system
In concept however revived somewhat modified form banner
first time multiple process owned different user running single machine process could interfere one another
For example one process might alter shared resource another process relied variable stored memory
When one user using system would result possibly wrong output multiple user might mean user got see information meant see
To prevent happening operating system needed enforce set policy determined privilege process
For example operating system might deny access certain variable certain process
The first international conference computer security London primarily driven industry customer
Significant early timesharing system

method operation multiple user different program interact nearly simultaneously
Because central processor operates substantially faster equipment video display terminal tape drive printer sufficient time solve several discrete problem process
Even though central processor address problem user sequence access retrieval system seems instantaneous standpoint remote terminal since solution available moment problem completely entered
developed late early make efficient use expensive processor time
Commonly used technique include parallel operation
Also many computer network organized purpose exchanging data resource centred system
In Christopher Strachey United Kingdom John McCarthy United States independently described something called
Meanwhile computer pioneer
Licklider Massachusetts Institute Technology MIT began An extension multiprogramming system developed known variously multiuser system
For history development section Project MAC UNIX
allows many people interact computer conventional system place many large technologically advanced company
system allowed computer resource shared rapid succession multiple user cycling queue user quickly computer appeared dedicated user task despite networking
Computers extremely expensive build operate
Because computer time costly researcher schedule limited access time
Any mistake typographical programmatic user input punch card would necessitate long wait multiprocessing called let many user share computer access rapidly switching
must guard interference user program system use virtual memory memory address space used program may reside secondary memory We welcome suggested improvement article

distribution computing resource many user via multiprogramming multitasking
This introduced computer still expensive prolific solution allow many user make use one computer affording one specific amount time user could access computer
This allowed many people use computer people could afford without actually owning one
This historical way using computer need queue user since modern computer even smallest one able cater multiple user fast processor operating system
The practice developed realization single user making use computer inefficient large group using
The reason interaction pattern individual wherein user enters large burst information followed long pause mostly due user thinking next move something else
But user use computer time would mean pause user could filled activity another user given large enough user base process could become efficient many user would able make use computer time would little time computer
Users able access computer different terminal prompted turn

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
My question regarding system
operating system assigns time slot task OS run various job parallel
But I get single processor system way achieve
I know I correct premise
So system different
And different key difference particularly system support etc
Thanks Just multiprogramming allows processor handle multiple batch job time multiprogramming also used handle multiple interactive job
In latter case technique reffered processor time shared among multiple user
In system multiple user simultaneously access system terminal OS interleaving execution user program short burst quantum computation
You keep mind principal objective time sharing system maximize processor use minimize response time
I think would correct however assert single processor system achieved time sharing
Remember processor execute one task time given time
By posting answer agree

Mainframe computer expensive
The central computer Dartmouth bought cost four million dollar great deal money small university
Moreover computer huge economy scale
Several year later Cornell studied option replacing mainframe computer IBM cost twice much smaller IBM yet four time powerful
With economy scale every organization followed strategy buy largest computer could afford find way maximize amount work done
Computer hardware improved rapidly performance reliability processor cycle scarce resource wasted
Computers previous generation run one program time central processor might spend much time idling
For example program process tray punched card would spend time waiting next card read
By middle decade computer powerful enough run one program time
The first technique allowed several task run simultaneously called multiprogramming
Each program given priority
At given moment operating system would offer central processor highest priority program
Suppose highest priority program copied punched card tape
The program would start read card wait card read
This caused interrupt scheduler would start next program priority
This might send data line printer
This program would spend much time waiting central processor could assigned another program
Rather unintuitively highest priority given program used central processor least
This primitive form multiprogramming required operator understand characteristic program
It evolved multitasking user specifies characteristic job memory requirement operating system schedule execution
Modern operating system use preemptive multitasking operating system manages entire scheduling interrupting preempting task predetermined time interval
IBM released often considered first modern operating system
Its focus efficient batch processing commercial data processing
The painful lesson learned development subject first book software engineering Fred Brooks
Batch processing operating system emphasis data processing job unsuitable academic computing
Universities therefore developed timesharing give faculty student direct access central computer
The early system included Multics MIT Titan Cambridge University Dartmouth Time Sharing System DTSS
MIT Cambridge emphasized need researcher Dartmouth focus undergraduate education
My first glimpse timesharing summer I visited Dartmouth sat lecture John Kemeny Basic programming
A year later wife graduate student MIT Multics production able write Fortran program research project
Titan This picture operator area Titan machine room Cambridge University
Notice hardcopy terminal paper coming
University Cambridge Timesharing allows central computer shared large number user sitting terminal
Each program turn given use central processor fixed period time
When time program interrupted next program resume execution
This called time slicing
A program also interrupted end time slice example might wait input
Timesharing particularly effective user want use computer intermittently program development long period editing followed short test run
It suitable batch processing typical commercial data processing computation
Dartmouth DTSS MIT Multics different objective system reflected difference architecture many feature common
Multics closely linked emerging discipline computer science
It often described precursor Unix
I recall visit Brian Kernigham Bell Labs Dartmouth intrigued discover feature Unix pipe equivalent architecture
Most Multics written language unlike operating system written assembly code tightly linked hardware architecture
DTSS direct commercial impact
Since large computer expensive commercial timesharing bureau sold computer time remote customer
The market leader General Electric GEIS originally developed joint project Dartmouth
Concepts DTSS adopted early minicomputer system company Hewlett Packard Digital Equipment Corporation
Even computer HAL film A Space Odyssey command taken DTSS
Timesharing dominated academic computing late replaced personal computer
Even difference academic commercial computing remained led university build first large network personal computer
As result academic computing computing mainstream followed separate path thirty year
Basic developed Dartmouth straightforward programming language student faculty
It became language choice educational computing
Basic never suitable large program reason often dismissed computer scientist ideally suited purpose
The simple syntax meant easy beginner
For example distinction made integer floating point number
As editing always problem hardcopy terminal Basic statement line number make change user retyped line
Finally syntax carefully designed fast compilation
Dartmouth specialized fast compiler almost every version Basic interpreted
Because efficient use hardware first commercial timesharing system based Basic
Later reason Basic dominant language early personal computer
Microsoft first product version Basic
Unfortunately Basic reputation Microsoft Basic numerous crude extension give programmer control hardware
As computer became powerful Dartmouth steadily extended language
The final version elegant structured language effective choice procedure good vector graphic
The design choice always emphasized simplicity
In early used Basic introductory computer science course Dartmouth second
For equivalent course Cornell today use Python Java
Some first minicomputer ran small timesharing system dedicated Basic interpreter
In I moved British Open University pioneer distance education providing degree program student across Britain
The university national timeshared network using Hewlett Packard HP Basic
The university teletype terminal study center around country
They connected computer system placing ordinary telephone handset acoustic coupler
The transmission speed bit per second
The Hewlett Packard computer could support simultaneous user
There one computer Open University headquarters Milton Keynes I think second system center north England
The computer provided one service Basic editor interpreter
The version Basic command language essentially Dartmouth first version
The first two computing course introduced Open University based system great success
The main difficulty technical
Many university student lived long distance study center design course student visit center often
My wife one first people terminal home kitchen
In day ultimate status symbol working wife
Digital Equipment Corporation often known Digital DEC created three different timesharing system widely used university RSTS PDP Dec
The original RSTS another Basic system rather like Hewlett Packard final version PDP general purpose timesharing system
It supported user used smaller college
I never used RSTS Open University Carnegie Mellon Dec
Carnegie Mellon six central machine room computer science department several
flexible command language good balance simplicity generality
Unfortunately unreliability hardware often let excellence software
The Dec extended version Basic Digital particular strength Fortran language
The VAX built reputation fast computation science engineering VMS operating system also good timesharing
Many liberal art college used academic computing widely used departmental computing center
Finally Unix began timesharing system Bell Labs ran variety Digital minicomputer
The version became central part academic computing Berkeley Standard Distribution BSD University California Berkeley
The definitive version BSD Digital VAX computer released

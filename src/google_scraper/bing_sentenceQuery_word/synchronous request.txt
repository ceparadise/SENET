What difference asynchronous synchronous execution
When execute something synchronously wait finish moving another task
When execute something asynchronously move another task finish
That said context computer translates executing process task another thread
A thread series command block code exists unit work
The operating system manage multiple thread assign thread piece slice processor time switching another thread give turn work
At core pardon pun processor simply execute command concept two thing one time
The operating system simulates allocating slice time different thread
Now introduce multiple mix thing CAN actually happen time
The operating system allocate time one thread first processor allocate block time another thread different processor
All allowing operating system manage completion task go code thing
Asynchronous programming complicated topic semantics thing tie together time
There numerous article book subject look
Synchronous mean connected dependent way
In word two synchronous task must aware one another one task must execute way dependent wait start task completed
Asynchronous mean totally independent neither one must consider way either initiation execution
Synchronous one thread Synchronous Asynchronous one thread Asynchronous Technically concept really
Although general unusual find asynchronous task running thread possible see example find two task executing synchronously thread No concept whether second subsequent task initiated first task completed whether must wait
That
What thread thread process CPUs indeed hardware task executed relevant
Indeed make point I edited graphic show
ASYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
In solving many engineering problem software designed split overall problem multiple individual task execute asynchronously
Inverting matrix finite element analysis problem good example
In computing sorting list example
The quick sort routine example split list two list sort calling recursively
In example two task often executed asynchronously
They need separate thread
Even machine one CPU one thread execution coded initiate processing second task first one completed
The criterion
As long start end time task overlap possible output neither needed input executed asynchronously matter many thread use
SYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
Any process consisting multiple task task must executed sequence one must executed another machine Fetch update data get stock quote financial service etc
If separate machine separate thread whether synchronous asynchronous
In simpler term SYNCHRONOUS You queue get movie ticket
You get one everybody front get one applies people queued behind
ASYNCHRONOUS You restaurant many people
You order food
Other people also order food wait food cooked served order
In kitchen restaurant worker continuously cooking serving taking order
People get food served soon cooked
I try explain simply I hopefully remember My bos busy man
He tell write code
I tell Fine
I get started watching like vulture standing behind shoulder
I like Dude WTF go something I finish
like No I finish
This synchronous
The bos tell rather waiting right work bos go task
When I finish job I simply report bos say I DONE
This Asynchronous Execution
It really simple
Hope help
Take advice NEVER work bos behind
mean execution happens single series

If calling routine run finish start finish start etc
With begin routine let run background start next point say wait finish
It like finish The advantage execute still running background separate thread take better advantage resource fewer hang wait
Synchronous mean caller wait response completion asynchronous caller continues response come later applicable
As example This always ouput But make doSomething asynchronous multiple way output become Because method making asynchronous call would immediately continue next line code
I say could order execution ca guaranteed asynch operation
It could also execute original depending thread timing etc
I think bit explanation still clarifies using real life example
Small Example Let say playing audio involves three step If audio player step sequentially every song synchronous
You wait time hear song till song actually get fetched decompressed
If audio player step independent asynchronous
ie
While playing audio step fetch audio harddisk parallel step decompresses audio parallel
step You end hearing song without waiting much fetch decompress
In nutshell synchronization refers two process point
In example Process A endpoint synchronized Process B start point Asynchronous process hand start endpoint synchronized Where Process A overlap Process B running concurrently dictionary definition hence confusion
It might helpful think term asynchronous synchronous instead asynchronous synchronous
Simply said asynchronous execution stuff background
For example want download file internet might use synchronous function block thread file finished downloading
This make application unresponsive user input
Instead could download file background using asynchronous method
In case download function return immediately program execution continues normally
All download operation done background program notified finished
When executing sequence like b c get failure middle execution like Then beginning synchronous If however sequence execute b c failure middle instead restarting beginning point failure know asynchronous
You confusing Synchronous Parallel v Series
Synchronous mean time
Syncronized mean related othere mean series fixed interval
While program running series
Get dictionary unsweet tea
You tea sweetened tea
Synchronous basically mean execute one thing time
Asynchronous mean execute multiple thing time finish executing current thing order move next one
As really simple example Imagine school student instructed walk queue road
The student got shoelace untied
Now stopped tying
All student behind stopped waiting get tied
The student walked past continuing usual pace
Just Imagine random people walking road
They queue course randomly walking different place road different pace
person shoelace got untied
She stopped get tied
But nobody waiting get tied
Everyone else still walking way pace
A synchronous operation work returning caller
An asynchronous operation work returning caller
When task executed synchronously wait task completed moving another task
One task depends end another When task executed asynchronously directly switch another task previous completed
One task depend
In programming task executed
It necessary understand several thread created task order avoid stacking single queue
That said concept synchronous asynchronous much thread reason I mention rare see task running asynchronously single thread although technically possible
In regard definition synchronous execution sometimes confusing good way understand Thank interest question

The operation may
A synchronous operation process till operation completes
An asynchronous operation operation
The caller could discover completion mechanism discussed later
Does make sense asynchronous RPC send
The notion synchronous operation requires understanding mean operation complete
In case remote assignment send receive complete message delivered receiver
In case remote procedure call send receive reply complete result delivered sender assuming return value
Otherwise send receive complete procedure finish execution
During time procedure executing sender receiver rendezvous mentioned
Note implies blocking vice versa every blocking operation synchronous every non blocking operation asynchronous
For instance send block till receiver machine received message blocking synchronous since receiver process may received
Similarly see later Xinu receive asynchronous
These definition operation similar identical one given text book tend equate synchronous blocking
Asynchronous message passing allows parallelism
Since process block computation message transit
In case receive mean process express interest receving message multiple port simultaneously
The select primitive discussed later provides facility synchronous receives
In synchronous system parallelism achieved forking separate process concurrent operation approach incurs cost extra process management
This cost typically bearable lwps hwps
Asynchronous message passing introduces several problem
What happens message delivered
The sender may never wait delivery message thus never hear error
Similarly mechanism needed notify asynchronous receiver message arrived
The operation invoker could learn polling getting software interrupt waiting explicitly completion later using special sycnhronous wait call
An asynchronous operation need return id application need later notified operation
At notification time id would placed global location passed argument handler wait call
Another problem related asynchronous message passing buffering
If message sent asynchronously buffered space managed OS process may fill space flooding system large number message

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In general synchronous pronounced Greek meaning meaning time adjective describing object event coordinated time
In information technology term several different usage
In telecommunication signaling within network network synchronous signal occur clock rate clock based single reference clock
signal almost quite synchronization signal run different clock different transition rate
In communication synchronous communication requires end exchange communication respond turn without initiating new communication
A typical activity might use synchronous protocol would transmission file one point another
As transmission received response returned indicating success need resend
Each successive transmission data requires response previous transmission new one initiated
Synchronous program communication contrasted program communication

One operation timed Powered

In sends message process may relies process supporting infrastructure select invoke actual code run
Message passing differs conventional programming process subroutine function directly invoked name
Message passing key
Message passing used ubiquitously modern computer software
It used way object make program work mean object system running different computer Internet interact
Message passing may implemented various mechanism including
Message passing technique invoking behavior running program computer
In contrast traditional technique calling program name message passing us distinguish general function specific implementation
The invoking program sends message relies object select execute appropriate code
The justification using intermediate layer essentially fall two category encapsulation distribution
idea software object able invoke service object without knowing caring service implemented
Encapsulation reduce amount coding logic make system maintainable
rather statement determine subroutine function call developer send message object object select appropriate code based type
One first example used domain computer graphic
There sort complexity involved manipulating graphic object
For example simply using right formula compute area enclosed shape vary depending shape triangle rectangle elipse circle
In traditional computer programming would result long statement testing sort object shape calling appropriate code
The way handle define class called subclass turn subclass simply send message asking compute area
Each object invoke subclass method formula appropriate kind object
Distributed message passing provides developer layer architecture provides common service build system made run disparate computer different location different time
When distributed object sending message messaging layer take care issue One important distinction among message passing system whether use synchronous asynchronous message passing
Synchronous message passing occurs object running time
With asynchronous message passing possible receiving object busy running requesting object sends message
Synchronous message passing typical programming language Java Smalltalk use
Asynchronous message passing requires additional capability storing retransmitting data system may run concurrently
The advantage synchronous message passing conceptually le complex
Synchronous message passing analogous function call message sender function caller message receiver called function
Function calling easy familiar
Just function caller stop called function completes sending process stop receiving process completes
This alone make synchronous message unworkable application
For example synchronous message passing would used exclusively large distributed system generally would perform well enough usable
Such large distributed system may need continue operate subsystem subsystem may need go offline kind maintenance time subsystem open receiving input system
Imagine busy business office desktop computer send email using synchronous message passing exclusively
Because office system use asynchronous message passing one worker turning computer cause computer freeze worker turn computer back process single email
Asynchronous message passing generally implemented complexity naturally occur trying synchronize system data handled intermediary level software
Commercial vendor develop software product support intermediate level usually call software
One common type middleware support asynchronous messaging called MOM
With asynchronous message passing sending system wait response
Continuing function call analogy asynchronous message passing would function call return immediately without waiting called function execute
Such asynchronous function call would merely deliver argument called function tell called function execute return continue execution
Asynchronous message passing simply sends message message bus
The bus store message receiving process request message sent
When receiving process arrives result sends result message bus message bus hold message original process designated next process pick message message bus
Synchronous communication built top asynchronous communication using
For example work ensuring sender always wait acknowledgement message receiver
The sender sends next message acknowledgement received
On hand asynchronous communication also built top synchronous communication
For example modern generally provide primitive asynchronous messaging implemented top using
The buffer required asynchronous communication cause problem full
A decision made whether block sender whether discard future message
If sender blocked may lead unexpected
If message dropped communication longer reliable
These example kind problem middleware vendor try address
In addition distinction synchronous asynchronous message passing primary distinguishing feature message passing system whether use distributed local object
With distributed object sender receiver may exist different computer running different operating system using different programming language etc
In case bus layer take care detail converting data one system another sending receiving data across network etc
The RPC protocol early example
Note type message passing requirement either sender receiver implemented using programming
It possible wrap system developed using procedural language treat large grained object capable sending receiving message
Examples system support distributed object
Distributed object system called shared nothing system message passing abstraction hide underlying state change may used implementation sending message
Distributed asynchronous message passing overhead associated compared simpler way simply calling procedure
In traditional argument passed receiver typically one containing address argument
This form communication differs message passing least three crucial area In message passing transferring argument involved operation involves copying existing argument portion new message upon creation
This applies regardless size argument case argument large document megabyte worth data
The argument copied entirety transmitted receiving object
By contrast standard procedure call address bit need passed argument may even passed requiring zero additional storage zero transfer time
This course possible distributed system since absolute address caller address space normally meaningless remote program however might fact usable receiver copy least sender memory advance
Web example process communicate message passing
A example way referencing resource depend exposing internals process
A call invocation exit invoked computation terminated
Asynchronous message passing contrast result response arriving significant time request message sent
A message handler general process message one sender
This mean state change reason unrelated behavior single sender client process
This contrast typical behavior object upon method invoked latter expected remain state method invocation
In word message handler behaves analogously
The prominent mathematical model message passing
In mathematical term message single mean pas control object
If object responds message message
argued message passing important object OOP object often
The programming model build upon observation us concept characterize behavior complex distributed system term message pattern using specification

As shown Byrant original paper time complexity composition algorithm cubic tight upper bound
My question synchronous composition written f f n replace variable f synchronously Boolean function G X
However I could find explicit reference mentioning time space complexity synchronous composition BDDs
Is anyone aware result
I aware result paper may relatively clear operation
And
Assume n variable c clause
We allocate variable BDD manager build BDD B also BDDs encode clause
Note BDDs size O c O n even independent variable ordering
Now computing C B give u BDD represents set solution SAT problem application synchronous composition operator
If could compute C time polynomial size SAT instance would give u polynomial time algorithm SAT
Even C count number solution lie higher complexity class finding
Also making use fixed variable ordering BDD argument extended talk QBF problem PSPACE complete
Obviously answer question
But light line reasoning I would find surprising algorithm actually implemented BDD library even polynomial time

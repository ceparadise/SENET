In used describe fashion
First proposed computer scientist generalization arrow provide way expressing relationship step computation
Unlike monad arrow limit step one one input
As result found use among application
While arrow use recognized distinct class Hughes would publish first definition
Until monad proven sufficient problem requiring combination program logic pure code
However useful library certain efficient parser defied rewriting monadic form
The formal concept arrow developed explain exception monadic code process monad turned arrow
Since arrow active area research
Their underlying law operation refined several time recent formulation arrow calculus requiring five law
In form proper subset Hughes arrow
While believed arrow time since proven arrow even general
In fact arrow merely equivalent directly equal Freyd category
Like type class arrow thought set quality applied
In arrow allow represented Haskell symbol combine form
However actual term arrow may also come fact arrow correspond also known arrow category theory different Kleisli category
As relatively new concept single standard definition formulation logically equivalent feature required method strictly obey certain mathematical law
The description currently used Haskell two basic operation Although two procedure strictly necessary define arrow method derived make arrow easier work practice theory
As arrow third operation class category One helpful method derived combination previous three In addition procedure arrow must obey certain rule type may applied The remaining law restrict piping method behaves order composition reversed also allowing simplifying Arrows may extended fit specific situation defining additional operation restriction
Commonly used version include arrow choice allow computation make decision arrow allow step take output input
Another set arrow known arrow application rarely used practice actually equivalent monad
Arrows several benefit mostly stemming ability make program logic explicit yet concise
Besides avoiding creates opportunity
This turn theoretically lead better easier feature like
Although program strictly requires arrow generalize away much dense pure declarative code would otherwise require
They also encourage giving common linkage program step class definition
The ability apply type generically also contributes reusability keep simple
Arrows disadvantage including initial effort defining arrow satisfies arrow law
Because monad usually easier implement extra feature arrow may unnecessary often preferable use monad
Another issue applies many construct efficiently code arrow style used computer

The section entitled following code mean
assignment operator language use single equal sign equality testing
The well known language Pascal
Due C influence language switched assignment testing
Some older text author trained style use pseudocode
You sometimes see arrow well
From article Some modern language use arrow assignment notably us global assignment whilst using single equal local assignment
From Sebesta Concepts Programming Languages class note King learn assignment standard go back much farther C Pascal
It appears Algol designed decided use assignment
The commitee composed American European representative
Some Germans committee familiar Konrad Zuse Plankalkul language drafted World War II published implemented wanted assignment follow language proposed assignment method assigned
The committee changed ground method entering program time called keypunch use
So compromised equal colon
However Americans familiar FORTRAN lower case wanted assignment operate left since FORTRAN
So managed get changed instead assignment operate toward left rather right style FORTRAN known implemented language rather Plankalkul virtually unknown language outside Germany implemented
Algol strongly influenced major subsequent imperative language including Pascal Thus Pascal kept ALGOL syntax assignment kept lefthandedness assignment
ALGOL designed easy read close mathematical notation
It de facto basically de jure standard writing algorithm journal next year
Therefore instructor computer scientist educated around would familiar style notation
The release allowed character thus prompting inclusion C among others
Just quick pedantic note
quite informal mean want mean
As others said specific language Pascal use assignment avoid confusion equality whereas language use combination purpose
As far actual concerned use equal assigned receives whatever float boat long consistent usage context within pseudocode clear
I guessing assignment I think assignment operator Delphi x assigning value x
But AFAIK thing theory could anything
It usually mean thing mean mathematics assignment

The Author
By Cridlig Kessler Thanh DOI University Nancy France Hemodialysis used half century often proposed first support treatment patient developing renal disease frequently peritoneal dialysis kidney transplantation
For large part success hemodialysis depends success vascular access whether achieved arteriovenous fistula central venous catheter
Survival vascular access often determines patient survival emphasizing importance carefully preserving often limited stock available vascular tissue
The purpose chapter review different possibility vascular access hemodialysis planning construction including discussion importance complementary exploration complex situation complication
Clinical case presented illustrate multidisciplinary management meet challenge desperate last chance situation providing lifesaving solution patient
Vascular access enable blood flow extra corporeal hemodialysis circuit appropriate inflow outflow pressure
In addition vascular access cause deleterious consequence patient limb ischemia related steal phenomenon stasis edema compressive effect instance head neck due peripheral central stenosis blocking venous backflow
An excessive flow rate compromise cardiac function
Several type vascular access available two modality catheter fistula
In past first hemodialysis system used external shunt made inserting canulas artery vein lower upper limb example Thomas shunt creating extracorporeal circulation
In sixty improved technique allowed creation first arteriovenous fistula AVF anastomotic bypass artery vein
AVFs may positioned upper limb lower limb proximally distally
Single central venous catheter may also inserted large vein neck thigh without tunnelization
Hemodialysis circuit From permission A central venous catheter may used vascular access emergency situation patient unprepared hemodialysis intercurrent event example thrombosis AVF infection situation contraindicating usual access occurs patient already hemodialysis
Insertion central catheter advantage offering immediate vascular access according guideline issued National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative KDOQI used le patient
Data United States Renal Data System USRDS however revealed patient started dialysis central catheter
Practices Europe United States differ shown DOPPS study adjustment confounding factor compared vascular access practice focusing particular factor associated use native AVF versus graft catheter
The prevalence native AVF use found Europe versus US
At dialysis onset European patient AVF including prosthetic graft versus US prosthetic graft
Patient referral pattern nephrological type vascular access used directly related closely monitored patient better prepared dialysis
There also economic element related general population access healthcare
It argued complication occur catheter AVF
A review literature confirms superiority native AVF prosthetic material catheter
Longer life fewer mechanical complication thrombosis stenosis lower infectious risk advantage native AVF
It recommended vascular access considered gold standard
risk especially elderly directly related type vascular access first used dialysis
There real advantage first vascular access native graft AVF
Survival also improved
A central catheter may however quite useful temporary permanent vascular access particular situation graft involvement short life expectancy cancer waiting AFV mature permanent access despite highly deteriorated vascular system heart failure severe arteriopathy risk steal phenomenon
For congestive heart failure patient preemptive construction AVF shown source decompensation
Catheters carefully designed respond need dialysis patient
Prerequisites include appropriate flow rate clearance quality diameter separate branch multiperforated tip physical resistance composing material silicone tolerance internal medium interaction surfacing process cosmetic acceptability
Portacaths tunnelization used since greatly reducing risk infection increasing distance point entry central vein point exit skin
To access central vein priority given jugular secondarily infraclavicular puncture reach superior vena cava first right side secondarily left side
Access inferior vena cava via femoral translumbar puncture always procedure
Example cuffed catheter From Canaud permission There certain number clinical prerequisite catheter insertion
Attention must given patient history vascular access potential problem anomaly risk stricture often revealed collateral circulation presence edema
Ultrasound guidance proven impact reducing risk complication
The pitfall blind puncture anatomic variation unknown stricture thrombus may avoided
This may especially important patient past history vascular access
Hemostasis checked
Treatments anticoagulant specific clinical feature hemodynamic situation respiratory function general status noted attempting position central catheter
A chest may useful catheter insertion general obtained radiology unit completing procedure
Local practice depend available facility catheter insertion feasible radiology unit
Catheter maintenance multifactorial process
Rigorous aseptic manipulation rule
Different type impregnated lock proposed depending objective anticoagulation fibrinolysis effect tauludine citrate
The debate continues concerning longevity catheter guideline vary week
These catheter however often used much longer period time
It also generally accepted tunnelized catheter temporary option waiting maturation AVF although clinical practice may dictate using permanent vascular access AVF unfeasible frail elderly patient
Different type acute complication noted hemorrhage traumatic arterial venous puncture vessel laceration pneumothorax hemothorax air embolism dysrhythmia neurological injury malposition
complication usually related duration use insertion general affect quality dialysis
According KDOQI catheter dysfunction defined blood flow blood pressure mmHg
There many cause related mechanical problem clot formation
Mechanical obstruction may arise catheter folded malpositioned catheter considered short long depending position tip relation right atrium
Clotting may result interaction leading progressive formation fibrin sheath around catheter
Blood clot may also form tip catheter perturbed blood flow microtrauma
This leading cause catheter dysfunction
Infection another important complication
A venous catheter constitutes portal inherent risk colonization dissemination
In chronic hemodialysis patient leading source infection turn leading cause morbidity mortality
Central vein repeatedly exposed catheter may develop zone stenosis
The hypothesized pathogenic mechanism would involve repeated microtrauma injuring endothelium turbulent blood flow local uremic context related renal failure chronic inflammation activation coagulation cascade
The use left side would impact since catheter longer local anatomic condition le favorable compression
Similarly complication would common infraclavicular puncture compared jugular puncture due anatomic configuration
Several type AVF proposed using different upper lower limb artery vein without graft straight forearm graft graft
Beyond vessel quality patient past history clinical situation limitation fistula configuration appears creativity nephrologist surgeon
Native prosthetic arteriovenous fistula T permission Map forearm vessel T permission One question often raised whether patient endogenous vasculature prosthetic graft preferred
Most clinician prefer reserve prosthetic graft second intention option failure one native AVF existing vascular network unusable first intention proposal
The advantage native AVFs mature rapidly offer easier effective surgical access thrombotic event occur
One retrospective study found risk access failure higher graft compared native AVF first second intention access
Greater longevity better quality fewer surgical revision advantage native AVF graft
If native AVF feasible graft would superior central catheter term complication although opinion varied
The Flixene graft composed synthetic material PTFE easy puncture
To date clinical study comparing mechanical complication Flixene vascular graft
The construction vascular access hemodialysis crucial event affecting patient survival
European American guideline issued
Several parameter exploration must taken account Patient characteristic genetic background age dominant hand spare vessel condition diabetes arteriopathy status venous network prior attempt form access presence pacemaker coagulation disorder heart failure risk decompensation fistula flow rate high possibility anesthesia patient education future renal transplantation waiting list blood group immunization projected graft Physical examination vessel map vessel characteristic sign collateral circulation edema suggesting possible stricture Allen maneuver search steal phenomenon vascular function Imaging finding ultrasound computed tomography angiogram Biochemical parameter would also impact although formal evidence lacking Physician experience training nephrologist surgeon also affect outcome
A recent study showed according responding nephrologists selection criterion AVF candidate quite variable
No consensus reached concerning appropriate indication contraindication creating AVF
Early complication mainly related operative procedure include hematoma operative site infection defective wound healing neurological problem
Complications occurring late also quite variable retarded maturation requiring collateral ligation favor development need change site anastomosis vein deep puncture
superficialization humerocephalic AVF bleeding ischemia related steal phenomenon flow rate high cardiac output requiring smaller caliber DRIL procedure aneurismal necrotic lesion related puncture thrombotic event stricture AVF central vein
No direct link daily dialysis session complication rate demonstrated
Infection also serious complication sometimes diffusing multiple site endocarditis spondylodiscitis
As rule good AVF exhibit optimal development
This mean avoiding complication treating develop early
It also mean limiting risk thrombosis stricture avoiding use venous access emergency situation
The site chosen AVF distal possible order facilitate puncture spare proximal vein later use needed
The AVF dominant side
What ideal AVF
According American European guideline AVF native distal
decision making nevertheless determines optimal configuration
proximal fistula insufficient distal network distal fistula avoid high flow rate patient heart failure synthetic graft central venous catheter patient poor vessel quality
When AVF constructed
Considering past experience available evidence concerted action undertaken several country increase proportion AVFs used hemodialysis vascular access
No consensus reached concerning optimal position AVF renal disease dialysis patient
The decision depends fast kidney disease progress availability healthy arterial venous tissue
In emergency context temporary access may created rapidly followed final configuration determined later position permanent vascular access option peritoneal dialysis etc
When AVF punctured
According KDOQI indicator optimal maturation include flow rate inner diameter
In clinical practice operator skill greatly affect decision use AVF consequently longevity
Good clinical practice focus local hygiene puncture technique puncture compression needle withdrawal
Care must taken avoid infection aneurysm necrotic tissue stricture
Several study compared use option versus rotation puncture point
Results discordant concerning advantage disadvantage two method pain ease puncture infection rate
There also question number needle
Unipuncture useful fistula punctured readily short insert two needle
It also solution bipuncture venous catheter inserted
Well performed unipuncture enable good quality dialysis equivalent morbidity mortality compared bipuncture technique
Data lacking concerning potential reduction complication rate unipuncture
How AVF monitored
Various method used check vascular access function detect development complication physical examination education patient nurse venous pressure blood recirculation flow rate clearance duplex Doppler CTangiogram fistulography performed without compression particularly identify steal phenomenon
Combining exploration often provides complementary information
The KDOQI proposes basic algorithm monitoring element
A software based impedancemetry combined tomography angiography innovative technology allowing study flow rate pressure within AVF thus early detection potential complication
Nephrologists radiologist vascular surgeon working together find appropriate solution individual patient construction vascular access key success
The goal achieve best possible vascular access survive long possible
In following section present example patient referred center failing vascular access
These desperate case illustrate audacious solution may found lifesaving vascular access
Catheter failure generally occurs patient several catheter AVF longer feasible
Mechanical complication however becoming le le common greater flexibility longer stability provided new material polyurethane silicone
Neither material proven superiority
In past immediate withdrawal rule infection developed patient
This still basic attitude catheter
If however catheter tunnelized clinician consider probabilistic antibiotic regimen initiated combination aseptic skin orifice subcutaneous tunnel
An antibiotic lock also useful
If course unfavorable poor control infection marker secondary spread catheter must withdrawn rapidly
In general catheter complication clot formation within catheter fibrin sheath treated withdrawal

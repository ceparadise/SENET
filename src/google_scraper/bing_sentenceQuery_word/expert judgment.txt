It quite often recommended one among best tool technique project management process
Experts treated asset organization provide input planning estimating activity opinion considered expert stakeholder customer
Expert Judgment one best accepted approach useful planning phase many activity
The approach save time planning also highlight risk considered executing
It also improves quality estimate provides accurate forecast
The role expert much needed planning risk identification process
Planning risk identification critical project success
Particularly big complex project project manager always look expert specialist outside make unbiased accurate decision
One important risk project inaccurate estimate
This definitely impact project performance
Industry finding say project meet project performance criterion Time cost scope objective
The expert judgement approach help provide accurate estimate suggested earlier
Risk identification another important area done early project life cycle
Unidentified risk threat project success
The risk management activity start identifying potential risk project
Experts opinion considered throughout risk management process reduce impact project risk
Expert judgment inevitable project life cycle sorted across knowledge area effective project management
Related Course I agree expert judgment ubiquitous panacea necessarily improve estimation
It improves estimation done properly
project management practitioner use written guidance eliciting expert judgment failure use structured process known result judgmental bias flawed estimate
For information improve expert judgment check research monograph I wrote subject

An someone prolonged intense experience practice education particular field
Informally expert someone widely recognized source whose faculty judging deciding rightly justly wisely accorded authority status specific domain
An expert generally person extensive based research experience occupation particular area study
Experts called advice respective subject always agree particular field study
An expert believed virtue special knowledge subject beyond average person sufficient others may rely upon individual
Historically expert referred
The individual usually profound distinguished sound
In specific field definition expert well established consensus therefore always necessary individual professional academic accepted expert
In respect shepherd year experience tending flock would widely recognized complete expertise use training sheep dog care sheep
Another example may taught human thereafter considered expert often outperforming human being particular task
In must recognized
Research area attempt understand relation expert knowledge skill personal characteristic exceptional performance
Some researcher investigated cognitive structure process expert
The fundamental aim research describe expert know use knowledge achieve performance people assume requires extreme extraordinary ability
Studies investigated factor enable expert fast accurate
characteristic skill knowledge person expert system distinguish expert novice le experienced people
In many domain objective measure performance capable distinguishing expert novice expert chess player almost always win game recreational chess player expert likely diagnose disease correctly etc
The word used refer also Expert Determination expert invited decide disputed issue
The decision may binding advisory according agreement party dispute
There two academic approach understanding study expertise
The first understands expertise emergent property
In view expertise socially constructed tool thinking script action jointly constructed within social group enabling group jointly define acquire expertise domain
In second view expertise characteristic individual consequence human capacity extensive adaptation physical social environment
Many account development expertise emphasize come long period deliberate practice
In many domain expertise estimate year experience deliberate practice common
Recent research expertise emphasizes nurture side argument
Some factor fitting dichotomy biological genetic starting age handedness season birth
In field education potential expert blind spot see also newly practicing educator expert content area
This based expert blind spot hypothesis researched Mitchell Nathan Andrew Petrosino
Newly practicing educator advanced expertise educational content area tend use formality analysis method particular area expertise major guiding factor student instruction knowledge development rather guided student learning developmental need prevalent among novice learner
The blind spot metaphor refers physiological blind spot human vision perception surroundings circumstance strongly impacted expectation
Beginning practicing educator tend overlook importance novice level prior knowledge factor involved adjusting adapting pedagogy learner understanding
This expert blind spot part due assumption novice cognitive schema le elaborate interconnected accessible expert pedagogical reasoning skill le well developed Borko Livingston
Essential knowledge subject matter practicing educator consists overlapping knowledge domain subject matter knowledge pedagogical content matter Borko Eisenhart Brown Underhill Jones Agard
Pedagogical content matter consists understanding represent certain concept way appropriate learner context including ability interest
The expert blind spot pedagogical phenomenon typically overcome educator experience instructing learner time
In line socially constructed view expertise expertise also understood form expert ability influence others result defined social status
By similar token fear expert arise fear intellectual elite power
In earlier period history simply able read made one part intellectual elite
The introduction Europe fifteenth century diffusion printed matter contributed higher literacy rate wider access knowledge academia
The subsequent spread education learning changed society initiated era widespread education whose elite would instead produced written content consumption education sphere
Plato concern expertise
Plato believe people clever enough look society best interest clever people world needed lead rest flock
Therefore idea born elite know truth complete form ruler Plato said must tell people city noble lie keep passive content without risk upheaval unrest
In contemporary society doctor scientist example considered expert hold body dominant knowledge whole inaccessible layman Fuller
However inaccessibility perhaps even mystery surround expertise cause layman disregard opinion expert account unknown
Instead complete opposite occurs whereby member public believe highly value opinion medical professional scientific discovery Fuller despite understanding
A number computational model developed explain development novice expert
In particular Kevin Gilmartin proposed model learning chess called MAPP Pattern Recognizer
Based simulation estimated unit memory necessary become expert hence many year needed reach level
More recently Chunk Hierarchy REtrieval STructures simulated detail number phenomenon chess expertise eye movement performance variety memory task development novice expert domain
An important feature expert performance seems way expert able rapidly retrieve complex configuration information memory
They recognize situation meaning
It perhaps central concern meaning attache situation provides important link individual social approach development expertise
Work Skilled Memory Expertise confronts paradox expertise claim people acquire content knowledge practice cognitive skill also develop mechanism enable use large familiar knowledge base efficiently
Work computer software designed provide answer problem clarify uncertainty normally one human expert would need consulted typically grounded premise expertise based acquired repertoire rule framework decision making elicited basis computer supported judgment
However increasing evidence expertise work fashion
Rather expert recognize situation based experience many prior situation
They consequence able make rapid decision complex dynamic situation
In critique expert system literature suggest If one asks expert rule using one effect force expert regress level beginner state rule learned school
Thus instead using rule longer remember knowledge engineer suppose expert forced remember rule longer use
No amount rule fact capture knowledge expert stored experience actual outcome ten thousand situation
The role long term memory skilled memory effect first articulated Chase Simon classic study chess expertise
They asserted organized pattern information stored long term memory chunk mediated expert rapid encoding superior retention
Their study revealed subject retrieved number chunk size chunk varied subject prior experience
Experts chunk contained individual piece novice
This research investigate expert find distinguish retrieve right chunk vast number hold without lengthy search long term memory
Skilled memory enables expert rapidly encode store retrieve information within domain expertise thereby circumvent capacity limitation typically constrain novice performance
For example explains expert ability recall large amount material displayed brief study interval provided material come domain expertise
When unfamiliar material domain expertise presented expert recall better novice
The first principle skilled memory state expert exploit prior knowledge durably encode information needed perform familiar task successfully
Experts form elaborate accessible memory representation novice
The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory code create multiple potential cue avenue retrieval
The second principle state expert develop memory mechanism called retrieval structure facilitate retrieval information stored long term memory
These mechanism operate fashion consistent meaningful encoding principle provide cue later regenerated retrieve stored information efficiently without lengthy search
The third principle state long term memory encoding retrieval operation speed practice speed accuracy approach speed accuracy short term memory storage retrieval
Examples skilled memory research described within Ericcson Stasewski study include Much research regarding expertise involves study expert novice differ solving problem Chi Glasser Rees
Mathematics Sweller Mawer Ward physic Chi Feltovich Glaser common domain study
One cited work area Chi et al
examines expert PhD student physic novice undergraduate student completed one semester mechanic categorize represent physic problem
They found novice sort problem category based upon surface feature keywords problem statement visual configuration object depicted
Experts however categorize problem based upon deep structure main physic principle used solve problem
Their finding also suggest schema novice expert activated feature problem statement expert schema contain procedural knowledge aid determining principle apply novice schema contain mostly declarative knowledge aid determining method solution
Relative specific field expert Germain Germain developed psychometric measure perception employee expertise called Generalized Expertise Measure GEM
She defined behavioral dimension expert addition dimension suggested Swanson Holton
Her scale contains objective expertise item subjective expertise item
Objective item named item
Subjective item remaining item measure named item behavioral component
Condensed Germain
Scholars rhetoric also turned attention concept expert
Considered appeal ethos personal character speaker established expertise allows speaker make statement regarding special topic audience may ignorant
In word expert enjoys deference audience judgment appeal authority
In The rhetoric expertise Johanna Hartelius defines two basic mode expertise autonomous attributed expertise
While autonomous expert posse expert knowledge without recognition people attributed expertise performance may may indicate genuine knowledge
With two category Hartelius isolates rhetorical problem faced expert someone autonomous expertise may posse skill persuade people hold point view someone merely attributed expertise may persuasive lack actual knowledge pertaining given subject
The problem faced audience follows problem facing expert faced competing claim expertise resource evaluate claim put
Hartelius scholar also noted challenge project Wikipedia pose expert traditionally constructed authority
In Wikipedia Emergence Dialogic Expertise highlight Wikipedia example dialogic expertise made possible collaborative digital space
Predicated upon notion truth emerges dialogue Wikipedia challenge traditional expertise anyone edit single person regardless credential end discussion fiat
In word community rather single individual direct course discussion
The production knowledge process dialogue argumentation becomes inherently rhetorical activity
Hartelius call attention two competing norm system expertise network norm dialogic collaboration deferential norm socially sanctioned professionalism Wikipedia evidence first
Drawing Hartelius posit Wikipedia example epistemic network driven view individual idea clash one another generate expertise collaboratively
Hartelius compare Wikipedia methodology discussion topic genuine considered live event continuously open new addition participant
Hartelius acknowledges important dimension expertise posit concept complex sociologist psychologist suggest
Arguing expertise rhetorical Hartelius explains expertise simply one person skill different another
It also fundamentally contingent struggle ownership
Effective communication inherent element expertise style knowledge
Rather leaving substance communicative style complementary
Hartelius suggests Wikipedia dialogic construction expertise illustrates instrumental constitutive dimension rhetoric instrumentally challenge constitutively function knowledge production
Going historical development encyclopedic project Hartelius argues change traditional encyclopedia led change traditional expertise
Wikipedia use connect one topic another depends develops electronic interactivity meaning Wikipedia way knowing dialogic
Dialogic expertise emerges multiple interaction utterance within
The ongoing dialogue contributor Wikipedia result emergence truth also explicates topic one expert
As Hartelius explains The act presenting information topic included traditional encyclopedia construction new
While Wikipedia insists contributor must publish preexisting knowledge dynamic behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless
Knowledge production created function dialogue
According Hartelius dialogic expertise emerged Wikipedia interactive structure also site hortative discourse found traditional encyclopedia
By Wikipedia hortative discourse Hartelius mean various encouragement edit certain topic instruction appear site
One reason emergence dialogic expertise Wikipedia site function techne explicating Wikipedia expert methodology
Building Hartelius Damien Pfister developed concept networked expertise
Noting Wikipedia employ rather one one model communication note expertise likewise shift become quality group rather individual
With information traditionally associated individual expert stored within text produced collective knowing something le important knowing find something
As put With internet historical power subject matter expertise eroded archival nature Web mean information readily available
The rhetorical authority previously afforded subject matter expertise given procedural knowledge find information called situation
An expert differs specialist specialist expert
The opposite expert generally known someone occupies middle grade understanding generally known often employed assist expert
A person may well expert one field layperson many field
The concept expert expertise debated within field general heading expert knowledge
In contrast opposite specialist would
The term widely used informally people described order bolster relative value opinion criterion expertise available
The term likewise used disparage opinion
arises expert become convinced opinion useful sometimes matter beyond personal expertise
In contrast expert known person new science field study activity social cause undergoing training order meet normal requirement regarded mature equal participant
Expert also mistakenly interchanged term new medium
An expert authority relationship people technology expert allowed control access expertise
However person merely wields authority right expert
In new medium user misled term authority
Many site search engine Google Technorati use term authority denote link value traffic particular topic
However authority measure populist information
It way assures author site blog expert

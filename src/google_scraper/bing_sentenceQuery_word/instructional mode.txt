An abstract model
It also referred
A realization ISA called
An ISA permit multiple implementation may vary physical size monetary cost among thing ISA serf
Software written ISA run different implementation ISA
This enabled different generation computer easily achieved development computer family
Both development helped lower cost computer increase applicability
For reason ISA one important abstraction today
An ISA defines everything need know order program computer
What ISA defines differs ISAs general ISAs define supported state semantics set comprises computer machine language model
An instruction set architecture distinguished set technique used particular processor implement instruction set
Processors different microarchitectures share common instruction set
For example implement nearly identical version radically different internal design
The concept distinct design specific machine developed IBM design phase
Prior NPL company computer designer free honor cost objective selecting technology also fashioning functional architectural refinement
The SPREAD compatibility objective contrast postulated single architecture series five processor spanning wide range cost performance
None five engineering design team could count able bring adjustment architectural specification way easing difficulty achieving cost performance objective
Some support ISA Microsoft implement translating bytecode commonly used code path native machine code
In addition virtual machine execute le frequently used code path interpretation see
implemented instruction set atop processor fashion
An ISA may classified number different way
A common classification architectural
A CISC many specialized instruction may rarely used practical program
A RISC simplifies processor efficiently implementing instruction frequently used program le common operation implemented subroutine resulting additional processor execution time offset infrequent use
Other type include VLIW architecture closely related LIW EPIC architecture
These architecture seek exploit le hardware RISC CISC making responsible instruction issue scheduling
Architectures even le complexity studied MISC OISC
These theoretically important type commercialized
built discrete
On processing architecture given instruction may specify More complex operation built combining simple instruction executed sequentially otherwise directed instruction
Examples operation common many instruction set include Processors may include complex instruction instruction set
A single complex instruction something may take many instruction computer
Such instruction instruction take multiple step control multiple functional unit otherwise appear larger scale bulk simple instruction implemented given processor
Some example complex instruction include Complex instruction common CISC instruction set RISC instruction set RISC instruction set may include well
RISC instruction set generally include ALU operation memory operand instruction move large block memory RISC instruction set include instruction perform arithmetic operation multiple piece data time
SIMD instruction ability manipulating large vector matrix minimal time
SIMD instruction allow easy algorithm commonly involved sound image video processing
Various SIMD implementation brought market trade name
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifies operation perform zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In VLIW architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous opcodes operand specified single instruction
Some exotic instruction set opcode field TTA operand
The instruction set lack operand specifier field including NOSC
Conditional instruction often predicate bit encode specific condition cause operation performed rather performed
For example conditional branch instruction executed branch taken condition true execution proceeds different part program executed branch taken condition false execution continues sequentially
Some instruction set also conditional move move executed data stored target location condition true executed target location modified condition false
Similarly IBM conditional store instruction
A instruction set include predicate field every instruction called
The size length instruction varies widely little four bit many hundred bit VLIW system
Processors used instruction size bit
The longest possible instruction byte bit
Within instruction set different instruction may different length
In architecture notably RISC typically corresponding architecture
In architecture instruction variable length typically integral multiple
Some variable encoding two fixed usually encoding instruction mixed freely must switched branch exception boundary
A RISC instruction set normally fixed instruction length often byte bit whereas typical CISC instruction set may instruction widely varying length byte
instruction le complicated handle instruction several reason check whether instruction straddle cache line virtual memory page boundary instance therefore somewhat easier optimize speed
The instruction constituting program rarely specified using internal numeric form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
The design instruction set complex issue
There two stage history microprocessor
The first CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer many different instruction
In however place like IBM research found many instruction set could eliminated
The result RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture us smaller set instruction
A simpler instruction set may offer potential higher speed reduced processor size reduced power consumption
However complex set may optimize common operation improve memory efficiency simplify programming
Some instruction set designer reserve one opcodes kind
For example us us eight code CF DF EF FF use code range
Fast virtual machine much easier implement instruction set meet
The used much easier implement unprogrammed state memory interpreted
On system multiple processor algorithm much easier implement instruction set includes support something atomic
Any given instruction set implemented variety way
All way implementing particular instruction set provide implementation instruction set able run executables
The various way implementing instruction set give different tradeoff cost performance power consumption size etc
When designing processor engineer use block electronic circuitry often designed separately adder multiplexer counter register ALUs etc
Some kind often used describe decoding sequencing instruction ISA using physical microarchitecture
There two basic way build implement description although many design use middle way compromise Some design use combination hardwired design microcode control unit
Some CPU design use compile instruction set writable inside CPU processor FPGA
An ISA also software
Naturally due interpretation overhead slower directly running program emulated hardware unless hardware running emulator order magnitude faster
Today common practice vendor new ISAs microarchitectures make software emulator available software developer hardware implementation ready
Often detail implementation strong influence particular instruction selected instruction set
For example many implementation allow single memory load memory store per instruction leading RISC
For another example early way implementing led
The demand digital signal processing pushed opposite instruction implemented particular way
For example perform digital filter fast enough MAC instruction typical DSP must use kind fetch instruction two data word simultaneously requires
In early computer memory expensive minimizing size program make sure would fit limited memory often central
Thus combined size instruction needed perform particular task important characteristic instruction set
Computers high code density often complex instruction procedure entry parameterized return loop etc
therefore retroactively named
However typical frequent CISC instruction merely combine basic ALU operation add access one operand memory using direct indirect indexed etc
Certain architecture may allow two three operand including result directly memory may able perform function automatic pointer increment etc
instruction set may even complex powerful instruction
first widely implemented period rapidly growing memory subsystem
They sacrifice code density simplify implementation circuitry try increase performance via higher clock frequency register
A single RISC instruction typically performs single operation add register load memory location register
A RISC instruction set normally fixed whereas typical CISC instruction set instruction widely varying length
However RISC computer normally require often longer instruction implement given task inherently make le optimal use bus bandwidth cache memory
Certain embedded RISC ISAs like typically exhibit high density owing technique called code compression
This technique pack two instruction one instruction unpacked decode stage executed two instruction
MISC form separate instruction multiple instruction fit single machine word
These type core often take little silicon implement easily realized form
The code density MISC similar code density RISC increased instruction density offset requiring primitive instruction task
There research mechanism improving code density
The mathematics describes challenge limit
Instruction set may categorized maximum number operand specified instruction
In example follow direct calculated address referring memory cell refer machine register
Due large number bit needed encode three register instruction RISC architecture instruction invariably design Atmel AVR version
RISC architecture instruction usually design architecture
Each instruction specifies number operand register memory location immediate value
Some instruction give one operand implicitly stored top implicit register
If operand given implicitly fewer operand need specified instruction
When destination operand explicitly specifies destination additional operand must supplied
Consequently number operand encoded instruction may differ mathematically necessary number argument logical arithmetic operation
Operands either encoded opcode representation instruction else given value address following instruction
measure availability free register point time program execution
Register pressure high large number available register use thus higher register pressure often register content must memory
Increasing number register architecture decrease register pressure increase cost
While embedded instruction set suffer extremely high register pressure small register set RISC ISAs like enjoy low register pressure
CISC ISAs like offer low register pressure despite smaller register set
This due many addressing mode optimization addressing memory operand ALU instruction absolute addressing addressing spill CISC ISAs offer

A computer program perform specific task executed computer
Before program start executing need translated machine language loaded random access memory computer
Then CPU fetch one instruction RAM one decodes understands executes
An instruction divided number
A consists anumber micro operation
A micro operation operation performed data stored register CPU arithmetic logical shift operation
Thus defined whichdescribes sequence micro operation performed computer
The computer instruction converted known
Hence instruction code give instruction computer perform specific task
The instruction code comprises
The Opcode specifies performed instruction addition subtraction multiplication etc
The operation specified Opcode performed known operand instruction
For example write instruction value variable x CPU register add x
The instruction code instruction would specifies add operation specifies address variable x
Computer Registers instruction memory location data
Sometimes also used part instruction
The input data output result instruction often stored register
Every register specific name function associated example DR Data Register AC Accumulator AR Address Register IR Instruction Register PC Program Counter
Instruction format every instruction computer need specified
It help determining instruction
Also instruction format help CPU determining length value memory location instruction
Hence instruction format considered format specify
The instruction format comprises following The address pert instruction format specifies address used instruction
The address directly specifies location operand computation type instruction known
The Opcode specifies performed instruction addition subtraction multiplication etc
An Opcode must bit distinct operation
It part Opcode specifies way instruction
We calculate effective address instruction help addressing mode
The addressing denoted instruction format
If computer capacity word bit memory location identified bit
Also instruction code would bit
So Opcode bit perform operation
Hence instruction format An instruction one following address type An instruction said direct address part instruction code contains actual address operand
The direct address instruction
For example instruction ADD direct mode add content memory location content accumulator
Here operand
An instruction said indirect address address part instruction code contains address memory location contains actual address operand
The indirect address instruction
For example instruction ADD indirect mode add content memory location present address content accumulator
The actual address operand present memory location
Here operand
An instruction said immediate address address part instruction code contains operand
The instruction immediate address
For Example instruction MOV A move data accumulator
Here present instruction
This type instruction contains
It used stack organized computer
The push pop operation used move operand memory fetch result memory
This type instruction contains
It us data manipulation
All operation performed memory operand accumulator
This type instruction contains
Both address field specify memory location processor register
It assumes result instruction stored address first operand instruction
This type instruction contains
Each field contain memory location processor register
The usage instruction reduces program size binary code many bit instruction code
Push W Push X Add Push Y Push Z Add Mul Pop I Top W Top X Top W X Top Y Top Z Top Z Top Y Z W X M I Top LDA W ADD X STA A LDA Y ADD Z MUL A STA I AC W AC AC X A AC AC Y AC AC Z AC AC A I AC MOV W ADD X MOV Y ADD Z MUL MOV I W X Y Z M I ADD W X ADD Y Z MUL I W X Y Z M I In implied addressing mode address operand instruction
The instruction code contains part
It also known
For example clear accumulator instruction clear content accumulator
Hence effective address instruction implied instruction EA AC
All implied mode instruction
In immediate addressing mode address part instruction specifies operand
Such instruction requires executes much faster
For example MUL instruction multiply content accumulator
An immediate mode instruction
An instruction memory direct addressing mode address part instruction format contains
Such instruction requires fetch data operand memory location
The effective address memory direct instruction would address mentioned instruction
ADD X add content data present location X accumulator
Hence effective address An instruction memory indirect addressing mode address part instruction contains address memory location contains actual address operand
It requires fetch data memory
Hence slower type instruction
instruction ADD X indirect addressing mode mean X contains memory location actual address operand present
So first need access location specified X need access location specified memory location fetch operand
Hence address found memory location An instruction register direct addressing mode address part instruction contains
The operand instruction resides register
Such instruction requires direct mode instruction well
But limited number register processor use mode often
The register direct instruction specified register
MUL R instruction multiplies content register R accumulator
Hence EA An instruction register indirect mode address part instruction contains register contains actualaddress
Hence need access memory location specified register fetch operand
Such instruction requires le number memory access
The instruction would address operand present register
instruction MUL R register indirect addressing mode mean register R contains address operand
An instruction register indirect mode address part instruction contains register contains actualaddress
Hence need access memory location specified register fetch operand
Such instruction requires le number memory access
The instruction would address operand present register
instruction MUL R register indirect addressing mode mean register R contains address operand
An instruction auto mode register indirect instruction content register either execution instruction execution instruction
The instruction address specified register
instruction CLR R clear content memory location specified register R increment content register hold next memory address
In relative addressing mode instruction calculated addition address next instruction executed address specified address part instruction also called offset
The register contains address next instruction executed
Hence PC address specified instruction
The obtained actual address operand
content PC address provided instruction In base register addressing mode instruction calculated addition content address specified address part instruction
The base register contains data operand address part instruction provides
Hence result obtained actual address operand
content base register address specified EA
The instruction code address part contains operand known
We access memory either directly indirectly hence addressing mode could either
For example AND ADD LDA memory reference instruction
The instruction code address part contains known
Hence operand register reference instruction stored
The operation directly performed register needed hence mode bit equal zero
CLA CLE INC register reference instruction
The instruction code address part specifies operation known reference instruction
The mode bit always case reference instruction
INP OUT reference instruction

Various perspective may considered designing interacting educational technology
examines approach
These theoretical perspective grouped three main theoretical school philosophical framework
This theoretical framework developed early century based animal learning experiment
Many psychologist used result develop theory human learning modern educator generally see one aspect holistic synthesis
Teaching behaviorism linked training emphasizing animal learning experiment
Since behaviorism consists view teaching people something reward punishment related training people
wrote extensively improvement teaching based functional analysis wrote The Technology Teaching attempt dispel myth underlying contemporary education well promote system called
developed learning system named Celeration based behavior analysis substantially differed Keller Skinner model
underwent significant change
While retaining empirical framework theory look beyond behavior explain learning considering human memory work promote learning
The Baddeley model established theoretical framework
Computer Science Information Technology major influence Cognitive Science theory
The Cognitive concept working memory formerly known short term memory long term memory facilitated research technology field Computer Science
Another major influence field Cognitive Science
Today researcher concentrating topic like
These theoretical perspective influence
Educational psychologist distinguish several type individual psychological constructivism
This form primary focus learner construct meaning new information interact reality learner bring different perspective
Constructivist learning environment require student use prior knowledge experience formulate new related adaptive concept learning Termos
Under framework role teacher becomes facilitator providing guidance learner construct knowledge
Constructivist educator must make sure prior learning experience appropriate related concept taught
Jonassen suggests learning environment useful novice learner environment useful advanced learner
Educators utilizing constructivist perspective may emphasize environment may incorporate learner centered ideally involving scenario student actively engaged critical thinking activity
An illustrative discussion example found deployment constructivist cognitive learning computer literacy involved programming instrument learning
programming language embodied attempt integrate Piagetan idea computer technology
Initially broad hopeful claim including perhaps controversial claim would improve general skill across discipline
However programming skill consistently yield cognitive benefit
It concrete advocate claimed privileged one form reasoning others difficult apply thinking activity activity
By late similar programming language lost novelty dominance gradually amid criticism
The extent assist replaces learning teaching approach variable ranging continuum none fully
A variety descriptive term employed somewhat inconsistently categorize extent technology used
For example learning may refer classroom aid laptop may refer approach traditional classroom time reduced eliminated replaced online learning
learning may describe either component hybrid approach fully online environment
may either
Synchronous learning occurs participant interacting time asynchronous learning allows participant engage exchange idea information without dependency involvement time
refers exchange idea information one participant period
Examples discussion online live teacher instruction feedback Skype conversation chat room virtual classroom everyone online working collaboratively time
Since student working collaboratively synchronized learning help student create open mind listen learn peer
Synchronized learning foster online awareness improves many student writing skill
may use technology well textbook document audio video course using
At professional educational level training may include
Asynchronous learning beneficial student health problem child care responsibility
They opportunity complete work low stress environment within flexible time frame
In online course student proceed pace

Parameters coherence value concurrent entertainment educational aspect suggested choosing medium
utilized public school United States well private school
Some environment take place traditional classroom others allow student attend class home location
There several state utilizing virtual school platform across country continue increase
For example Digital technology becoming increasingly commonplace education many researcher argue save money transform school effective institution
With technology heavy influence society doubt school looking technology teach student
Meanwhile despite debate effectiveness computerized education school proliferating nationwide enrollment online course soaring
Technology make anyone life much easier proven help student effective way
But digitized world education computer increasingly taking teacher role
Computers hear student speak example correct pronunciation evaluate progress time say Michael Kamil professor emeritus Stanford University School Education
Many expert claim digital education future
If want kid prepared life school century need consider technology basic element public education said New York Deputy Chancellor EducationJohn White
And many school making requirement take online class
Digital learning getting boost locality across nation year
For example Idaho became first state require student complete two online course receive diploma
It doubt digital education increasing educational system
enables student log course anywhere internet connection
increasingly utilized student may want go traditional brick mortar school due severe allergy medical issue fear student whose parent would like homeschool feel qualified
Online school create student receive quality education almost completely avoiding common problem
Online charter school also often limited location income level class size way brick mortar charter school
also rising supplement traditional classroom
Students special talent interest outside available curriculum use advance skill exceed grade restriction
Some online institution connect student instructor via technology form digital classroom
National private school also available online
These provide benefit student state charter online school available
They also may allow student greater flexibility exemption state testing
Virtual education often refers higher education
cyber innovative administrative model course delivery technology
Online college course enrollment seen increase enrollment nearly one third college student estimated million student currently enrolled online class
In percent student USA taking course online projected rise percent
Although large proportion higher education institution offer online class half private school
Private institution may become involved presentation cost decrease
Properly trained staff must also hired work student online
These staff member need understand content area also highly trained use computer Internet
Online education rapidly increasing online even developed leading research university
Although MOOCs may limitation preclude fully replacing college education program significantly expanded
offer class global audience college credit
program like founded offer wide range discipline charge others permit student audit course charge require small fee accreditation
MOOCs significant impact higher education declined initial expansion expected remain form
Private organization also offer class free computer science class free available via
Distributed open collaborative course DOCC see MOOC emphasizing decentralized teaching
accredited online university
offer online course
According magazine million people worldwide enrolled free online course
Companies spread use staff bring customer information latest
CPD deliver update valuable workplace skill
For effectiveness competitive learning performance scoring system designed give live feedback complex mobile learning scenario
There important need recent reliable health information made available public well summarized form public health provider
Providers indicated need automatic notification latest research single searchable portal information access
The funded screen latest research develop automatic notification provider MCH Alert
Another application public health development use mobile telecommunication multimedia global public health
MHealth used promote prenatal newborn service positive outcome
In addition Health system implemented mHealth program facilitate emergency medical response support health promotion data collection
In low middle income country mHealth frequently used text message phone reminder promote treatment adherence gather data
There also growing interest beneficial educational method student ADHD
With growing popularity among higher education opportunity take online class becoming increasingly important student age
However student ADHD special need face different learning demand compared typical developing learner
This especially significant considering dramatic rise ADHD diagnosis last decade among child adult
Compared traditional classroom virtual classroom require higher level executive function primary deficit associated ADHD
Although ADHD specifically named Rehabilitation Act student ADHD symptom interfere learning ability may eligible assistive technology
Some example resource may help interest student adult ADHD consist computer software brain game timer calendar voice recognition device screen magnifier talking book
Wolf list executive function skill necessary student succeed postsecondary education plan set goal organize initiate sustain flexibility monitor use feedback structure manage time manage material follow
These skill along strong independent learning especially pronounced online environment many ADHD student suffer deficit one executive function present significant challenge accessibility barrier current approach
Some noted current model moving towards applying constructivism learning theory emphasizes environment postulate everyone ability construct knowledge meaning process problem solving discovery
However principle constructivism may appropriate ADHD learner principle include active learning motivation strong focus
Despite limitation student special need including ADHD expressed overall enthusiasm identified number benefit including availability online course note material additional resource ability work independent pace spend extra time formulating thoughtful response class discussion help understanding course ability review lecture multiple time enhanced access communication course instructor
The design platform way enable universal access received attention several direction including WAI
WAI provides universal formatting standard website remain accessible people disability
For example developing adopting material enable accessibility people
The offer learning resource tailored visually impaired including webcasts webinars downloadable science activity online library access resource material blindness deaf blindness
Online education may appear promising alternative student physical sensory disability get work pace home
However online program equal come resource student disability
Students disability wish enroll online education must either able advocate right person willing advocate
The American Disabilities Act state online program must provide appropriate accommodation student disability specifically defined mean
Once student disability accepted online program prepare direct open need succeed expert say Haynie
Educational technology particularly online learning environment allow student use real identity pseudonym anonymous identity classroom communication
Advantages anonymizing race age gender increased student participation increased communication
Risks include increased cyberbullying aggressive hostile language
Effective technology use deploys multiple strategy concurrently
adaptive content frequent testing immediate feedback etc
effective teacher
Using computer form technology give student practice core content skill teacher work others conduct assessment perform task
Through use educational technology education able individualized student allowing better differentiation allowing student work mastery pace
Modern educational technology improve access education including full degree program
It enables better integration student particularly continuing education improved interaction student instructor
Learning material used long distance learning accessible wider audience
Course material easy access
In American family household access internet
In according Canadian Radio Television Telecommunications Commission Canada home access internet
Students access engage numerous online resource home
Using online resource Talks help student spend time specific aspect may learning school home
Schools like made certain course material free online
Although aspect classroom setting missed using resource helpful tool add additional support educational system
The necessity pay transport educational facility removed
Students appreciate convenience report greater engagement learning environment
According James Kulik study effectiveness computer used instruction student usually learn le time receiving instruction like class develop positive attitude toward computer class
Students independently solve problem
There intrinsic restriction difficulty level
student go pace
Students editing written work word processor improve quality writing
According study student better critiquing editing written work exchanged computer network student know
Studies completed computer intensive setting found increase cooperative higher order learning writing skill problem solving using technology
In addition attitude toward technology learning tool parent student teacher also improved
Employers acceptance risen time
More human resource manager surveyed August report said two candidate level experience applying job would kind effect whether candidate obtained degree acquired online traditional school
percent said employed candidate online degree past month
However said candidate get degree online seen positively job applicant traditional degree
The use educational apps generally positive effect learning
test reveal use apps mobile device reduces achievement gap struggling average student
Some educational apps improve group work allowing student receive feedback answer promoting collaboration solving problem example apps found third paragraph
The benefit learning exhibited age group
Kindergarten student use iPads show much higher rate literacy
Medical student University California Irvine utilized iPad academically reported score higher national exam previous class
Many US state spend large sum money technology
However none looking technology return investment ROI connect expenditure technology improved student outcome
New technology frequently accompanied unrealistic hype promise regarding transformative power change education better allowing better educational opportunity reach mass
Examples include silent film broadcast radio television none maintained much foothold daily practice mainstream formal education
Technology necessarily result fundamental improvement educational practice
The focus need learner interaction technology
It need recognized ecological rather additive subtractive
In ecological change one significant change create total change
According Branford et technology guarantee effective learning inappropriate use technology even hinder
A University Washington study infant vocabulary show slipping due educational baby DVDs
Published Journal Pediatrics University Washington study vocabulary baby surveyed parent Washington Minnesota
The study found every one hour baby month age watched DVDs Videos knew fewer common baby word baby watch
Andrew Meltzoff surveyor study state result make sense baby time spent front DVDs TV instead people speaking baby going get linguistic experience
Dimitri Chistakis another surveyor reported evidence mounting baby DVDs value may harmful
Adaptive instructional material tailor question student ability calculate score encourages student work individually rather socially collaboratively Kruse
Social relationship important environment may compromise balance trust care respect teacher student
MOOCs although quite popular discussion technology education developed country US major concern developing country
One stated goal MOOCs provide le fortunate population developing country opportunity experience course content structure
However research show registrant country although many course thousand registered student complete course
MOOCs also implies certain curriculum teaching method superior could eventually wash possibly washing local educational institution cultural norm educational tradition
With Internet social medium using educational apps make student highly susceptible distraction sidetracking
Even though proper use shown increase student performance distracted would detrimental
Another disadvantage increased potential cheating
Smartphones easy hide use inconspicuously especially use normalized classroom
These disadvantage managed strict rule regulation mobile phone use
Electronic device cellphone computer facilitate rapid access stream source may receive cursory attention
Michel Rich associate professor Harvard Medical School executive director center Media Child Health Boston said digital generation Their brain rewarded staying task jumping next thing
The worry raising generation kid front screen whose brain going wired differently
Students always faced distraction computer cellphone particular challenge stream data interfere focusing learning
Although technology affect adult young people may influenced developing brain easily become habituated switching task become unaccustomed sustaining attention
Too much information coming rapidly overwhelm thinking
Technology rapidly profoundly altering brain
High exposure level stimulate brain cell alteration release neurotransmitter cause strengthening neural pathway weakening others
This lead heightened stress level brain first boost energy level time actually augment memory impair cognition lead depression alter neural circuitry hippocampus amygdala prefrontal cortex
These brain region control mood thought
If unchecked underlying structure brain could altered
due technology may begin young
When child exposed age seven important developmental task may delayed bad learning habit might develop deprives child exploration play need develop
Media psychology emerging specialty field embrace electronic device sensory behavior occurring use educational technology learning
According Lai learning environment complex system interplay interaction many thing impact outcome learning
When technology brought educational setting pedagogical setting change teaching change entire meaning activity without adequate research validation
If technology monopolizes activity student begin develop sense life would scarcely thinkable without technology
Leo Marx considered word technology problematic susceptible reification phantom objectivity conceals fundamental nature something valuable insofar benefit human condition
Technology ultimately come affecting relation people notion obfuscated technology treated abstract notion devoid good evil
Langdon Winner make similar point arguing underdevelopment philosophy technology leaf u overly simplistic reduction discourse supposedly dichotomous notion making versus us new technology narrow focus use lead u believe technology neutral moral standing
These critique would u ask How maximize role advancement technology education
rather What social human consequence adopting particular technology
Winner viewed technology form life aid human activity also represents powerful force reshaping activity meaning
For example use robot industrial workplace may increase productivity also radically change process production thereby redefining meant work setting
In education standardized testing arguably redefined notion learning assessment
We rarely explicitly reflect strange notion number say could accurately reflect person knowledge world
According Winner recurring pattern everyday life tend become unconscious process learn take granted
Winner writes By far greatest latitude choice exists first time particular instrument system technique introduced
Because choice tend become strongly fixed material equipment economic investment social habit original flexibility vanishes practical purpose initial commitment made
In sense technological innovation similar legislative act political founding establish framework public order endure many generation
When adopting new technology may one best chance get right
Seymour Papert point good example bad choice become strongly fixed social habit material equipment choice use QWERTY keyboard
The QWERTY arrangement letter keyboard originally chosen efficient typing early typewriter prone jam adjacent key struck quick succession
Now typing become digital process longer issue QWERTY arrangement life social habit one difficult change
Neil Postman endorsed notion technology impact human culture including culture classroom consideration even important considering efficiency new technology tool teaching
Regarding computer impact education Postman writes What need consider computer nothing efficiency teaching tool
We need know way altering conception learning conjunction television undermines old idea school
There assumption technology inherently interesting must helpful education based research Daniel Willingham always case
He argues necessarily matter technological medium whether content engaging utilizes medium beneficial way
The concept gap access digital technology
Access may associated age gender status education income ethnicity geography
According report large amount personal data child collected electronic device distributed school United States
Often far information necessary collected uploaded stored indefinitely
Aside name date birth information include child browsing history search term location data contact list well behavioral information
Parents informed informed little choice
According report constant surveillance resulting educational technology warp child privacy expectation lead limit creativity
Since technology end goal education rather mean accomplished educator must good grasp technology advantage disadvantage
Teacher training aim effective integration classroom technology
The evolving nature technology may unsettle teacher may experience perpetual novice
Finding quality material support classroom objective often difficult
Random professional development day inadequate
According Jenkins Rather dealing technology isolation would better take ecological approach thinking interrelationship among different communication technology cultural community grow around activity support
Jenkins also suggested traditional school curriculum guided teacher train student autonomous problem solver
However today worker increasingly asked work team drawing different set expertise collaborating solve problem
Learning style method collecting information evolved student often feel locked world described textbook depersonalized abstract prose used describe
These century skill attained incorporation engagement technology
Changes instruction use technology also promote higher level learning among student different type intelligence
There two distinct issue assessment assessment educational technology assessment technology
Assessments educational technology included project
technology may either
Instructors use type assessment understand student progress learning classroom
Technology helped teacher create better assessment help understand student trouble material issue
Formative assessment difficult perfect form ongoing allows student show learning different way depending
Technology helped teacher make formative assessment better particularly use classroom response system CRS
A CRS tool student handheld device partner teacher computer
The instructor asks multiple choice true false question student answer device
Depending software used answer may shown graph student teacher see percentage student gave answer teacher focus went wrong
Some example CRSs Quizzler Turning Systems quiz aspect Mastering Programs example Mastering Physics Mastering Chemistry
Summative assessment common classroom usually set easily graded take form test project specific grading scheme
One huge benefit testing option give student immediate feedback answer
When student get response able know class help push improve give confidence well
Technology also allows different kind summative assessment digital presentation video anything else may come allows different learner show learned effectively
Teachers also use technology post graded assessment online student better idea good project

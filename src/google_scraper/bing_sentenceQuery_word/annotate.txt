Annotation term used computer programming refer documentation comment may found code logic
Annotation typically ignored code executed compiled
Sometimes programmer anticipate learning programming language HTML may modifying programming later date require explanation rationale behind logic even explanation logic accomplishes purpose goal
Thus annotation explanation included within code
In source control derivative annotation annotate annotated may used
Annotate also called blame function used determine committed code change
That person may annotated mean blamed committing code programming change caused program fail behave unintended way
In Java annotation special kind modifier convention precedes modifier
The annotation consist sign followed particular type many parenthesized list pair
These followed right parenthesis

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

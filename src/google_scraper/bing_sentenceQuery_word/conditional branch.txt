A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

transfer also known conditional branching whereby would able jump different instruction depending value data
This extremely powerful feature missing many early computer century

The conditional control structure allows program follow alternative path execution
Iteration looping give computer much power
They repeat sequence step often necessary appropriate repetition quite simple step solve computer Colossus conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot flexibility machine conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot

In feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Apart case always achieved selectively altering based condition
In language term conditional usually used whereas term conditional conditional construct preferred term distinct meaning
A conditional sometimes colloquially referred especially perceived simple one specific form irrelevant unknown
Although usually classified conditional construct another way select alternative
The construct sometimes called common across many programming language
Although syntax varies language language basic structure form look like In example code part represented constitutes conditional intrinsic value may substituted either value intrinsic meaning
In contrast combination expression surrounding consequent follows afterward constitute conditional intrinsic meaning expressing coherent logical rule intrinsic value
When find expects condition example mean variable x contains number greater zero evaluates condition
If condition statement following executed
Otherwise execution continues following branch either usually optional branch
After either branch executed return point
In early programming language especially dialect statement could contain statement
This led style programming known program style called
As result allows virtually arbitrary statement put statement block inside statement gained popularity became norm even BASIC programming circle
Such mechanism principle based older advanced family language language influenced modern BASIC variant many year
While possible using statement statement write program spaghetti code well structured readable program written structured programming language structured programming make easier enforces
Structured statement like example one key element structured programming present popular programming language
A subtlety optional else clause found many language mean since conditionals parsed multiple way
Specifically parsed depending whether associated first second
This known problem resolved various way depending language
By using possible combine several condition
Only statement following first condition found true executed
All statement skipped
The statement simply followed
In Ada difference one needed one us instead followed
This similar provides keyword avoid large number brace would required multiple statement also us special keyword structure denoted indentation rather brace repeated use would require increased indentation every condition
Similarly earlier UNIX shell later gathered POSIX shell syntax use elif giving choice delimiting space line break
However many language directly descended Algol special syntax construct present present many syntactical derivative C PHP
This work language statement case follow conditional without enclosed block
This design choice slight cost code branch effectively adding extra nesting level complicating job compiler implementors analyse implement arbitrarily long chain recursively
If term sequence conditionals testing value single expression alternative also called
Conversely language switch statement produced sequence statement
Many language support similar statement return value result
Thus true expression evaluate value statement change program state perform kind action
member family allow expression In dialect first inspired great extent ALGOL In part compulsory every expression must value
Logic would expressed conditionals language usually expressed recursive function
Because Haskell possible write control structure ordinary expression lazy evaluation mean evaluate condition proper branch strict language would evaluate three
It written like language special conditional expression function may described template like This mean inlined expression unlike language compared expression similar Ruby Scala among others
To accomplish using would take one line code typical layout convention Some argue explicit statement easier read may compile efficient code ternary operator others argue concise expression easier read statement spread several line
First user run program cursor appears waiting reader type number
If number greater text My variable named
displayed screen
If number smaller message My variable named
printed screen
In language function called provided used conditional expression
However behave like true conditional expression true false branch always evaluated result one thrown away result returned IIf function
Up language Fortran arithmetic statement halfway computed IF case statement based This earliest conditional statement Fortran Where e numeric expression necessarily integer equivalent Because equivalent multiple statement could jump anywhere considered unstructured control statement used structured statement used
In practice observed arithmetic statement referenced following statement one two label
This conditional control statement original implementation Fortran computer
On computer three address three state
Other computer would flag register positive zero negative even overflow carry associated last arithmetic operation would use instruction accumulator negative accumulator zero similar
Note expression evaluated case integer arithmetic overflow may occur overflow carry flag would considered also
In contrast language conditional statement defined class abstract method take two parameter
two subclass define method executing first closure executing second closure
In concept conditional expressed using expression ifThenElse passed two function left right conditionals also pas empty tuple result ifThenElse order actually call chosen function otherwise ifThenElse return function object without getting called
In system number used without definition like Lisp Traditional paper math expressed single closure Here true false ifThenElse bound respective definition passed scope end block
A working JavaScript analogy using function single variable rigor The code multivariable function look like another version earlier example without system number assumed
First example show first branch taken second example show second branch taken
Smalltalk us similar idea true false representation True False singleton object respond message differently
Haskell used use exact model Boolean type time writing Haskell program use syntactic sugar b else c construct unlike ifThenElse compose unless either wrapped another function shown The Haskell section page
language multiway branch compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In dynamic language case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
may seen sophisticated alternative statement
It available many programming language functional programming feature many others
Here simple example written language The power pattern matching ability match action also pattern data
Here example written illustrates feature This code defines function applies first argument function element second argument list return resulting list
The two line two definition function two kind argument possible case one list empty return empty list case list empty
Pattern matching strictly speaking choice construct possible Haskell write one alternative guaranteed always matched situation used choice construct simply way bind name value
However frequently used choice construct language available
In programming language comparable data structure idiomatic use implement conditional assignment
In language allow programmer assign named function variable reference conditional flow implemented using hash

I searching web I finding somewhat contradictory answer
Some source assert Turing complete conditional unconditional branching I guess kind redundant say unconditional required others conditional required
Reading German Wikipedia say The German shown working May designed Konrad Zuse
It first digital computer electromechanical rather electronic used relay function
It computed logically using binary math
It programmable punched tape lacked conditional branch
While designed accidentally found exploit complex clever hack necessary
What complex clever hack exactly
A paper Abstract Rojas also state Note I read paper snippet IEEE
The computing machine built Konrad Zuse could execute fixed sequence floating point arithmetical operation addition subtraction multiplication division square root coded punched tape
An interesting question ask viewpoint history computing whether operation sufficient universal computation
The paper show fact single program loop containing arithmetical instruction simulate Turing machine whose tape given finite size
This done simulating conditional branching indirect addressing purely arithmetical mean
Zuse therefore least principle universal today computer bounded addressing space
In short SOers type branching exactly required
Assuming infinite memory language branching construct construct considered
The original Rojas paper found
The basic idea support unconditional single loop gluing end instruction tape together
You build conditional execution putting code section one another loop variable z determines section execute
At beginning section j set make assignment section read
assignment except active section
Now still includes conditional assignment compare
He proposes use binary representation z along negated binary representation j compute This product c z differ bit happen
An assignment z essentially indirect jump must also assign
Rojas also written
There proposes machine code relative addressing read Turing instruction memory modify program jump accordingly
As alternative proposes approach version us LOAD A STORE A INC DEC
If arithmetical expression use property arithmetical operation
either depending condition previously computed computes expression
You need something branch based result input
One way simulate conditional branch code computation deposit result stream instruction executed
You could put unconditional jump instruction stream math input create correct target jump depending set condition input
For example subtract x shift right positive negative add base address store result immediately following jmp
When get jmp go one address another x
If compute address simulate arbritary conditionals
I occasionally used simulate ON x GOTO b c ZX Basic
If true numerical value false construction like identical So yes computed goto ability goto jmp act conditional
The Turing complete abstract point view
You arbitrarily long program tape compute side every conditional branch
In word branch would compute answer tell one ignore
Obviously creates exponentially larger program every conditional branch would could never use machine manner
You need conditional branching build machine course machine provide conditional branching core feature
It proved system simple used implement Turing machine
You sure need conditional branching pull system bit bucket
Actually one could use
The point Turing machine provide conditional branching anyway proving Turing completeness somewhat implementing conditional branching
You without conditional branching point rock
If machine branch yes Turing complete
Hoever also machine ca jump branch even IF still Turing complete
The reason automatically make computer Turing complete thus
Processing process identifying input select output
Branching one way mentalize process condition jump classify input place branch store correct output input
So finally clarify If conditional branching computer necessarily computationally equivalent
HOWEVER plenty way computer achieve completeness

Sometimes loop CPU spends time branch prediction miss misprediction often near probability
I seen technique isolated thread never list
The one I know already fix situation condition turned bool used way change
Are conditional branch avoided

pseudocode Can rewritten arguably losing readability something like Also I seen technique wild changing conditional certain context escaping mind right
I rookie level optimization sure feel like got
I believe common way avoid branching leverage bit parallelism reducing total jump present code
The longer basic block le often pipeline flushed
As someone else mentioned want unrolling loop providing branch hint going want drop assembly
Of course done utmost caution typical compiler write better assembly case human
Your best hope shave rough edge make assumption compiler deduce
Here example following C code In assembly without jump using extreme commenting Note conditional move immediately jumped assembly enthusiast easily understood provide higher level language concept convenient single instruction
They necessarily faster available older processor mapping C code corresponding conditional move instruction work compiler
Using Matt Joiner example You could also following without dig assembly code The generalization example give replace conditional evaluation math avoidance largely boil
What going replacing since constitutes conditional evaluation
get logical result side either
Same applies except need make sure side constrained logic purpose
using result Booleanly
GCC already smart enough replace conditionals simpler instruction
For example newer Intel processor provide conditional move
If use provides instruction short char time
Additionaly compute minimum use see However pay attention thing like even jump implied much slower My best guess first snippet pollute cache often second
At level thing
Is compiler using smart enough compile without control flow
gcc smart enough
On older embedded instruction set may possible compute without control flow
Beyond warning hard make helpful general statement
So general statement may unhelpful Modern hardware terrifyingly good
If could find real program bad branch prediction cost slowdown I surprised
Performance counter tool tell find branch mispredictions indispensible
If actually need improve code I look trace scheduling loop unrolling Loop unrolling replicates loop body give optimizer control flow work
Trace scheduling identifies path likely taken among trick tweak branch direction hardware work better common path
With unrolled loop longer path trace scheduler work I leery trying code assembly
When next chip come new hardware chance excellent hard work go drain
Instead I look
In opinion reaching level optimization probably time drop right assembly language
Essentially counting compiler generating specific pattern assembly take advantage optimization C anyway
It difficult guess exactly code compiler going generate look anytime small change made assembly done
An extension technique demonstrated original question applies several nested test get answer
You build small bitmask result test look answer table
If b nearly random arbitrary data tight loop branch prediction failure really slow
Can written You generalize several conditionals
I seen done
If nesting get deep though want make sure testing really faster minimal test suggested evaluation
This level optimization unlikely make worthwhile difference hottest hotspot
Assuming without proving specific case form first rule optimization
Most processor provide branch prediction better
In fact get improvement branch prediction probably publish paper
There mountain paper topic interested
You better worrying cache hit miss

From software engineer perspective SCM facilitates development change implementation activity
A successful SCM implementation requires careful planning management
This turn requires understanding organizational context constraint placed design implementation SCM process
To plan SCM process project necessary understand organizational context relationship among organizational element
SCM interacts several activity organizational element
The organizational element responsible software engineering supporting process may structured various way
Although responsibility performing certain SCM task might assigned part organization development organization overall responsibility SCM often rest distinct organizational element designated individual
Software frequently developed part larger system containing hardware firmware element
In case SCM activity take place parallel hardware firmware CM activity must consistent CM
Note firmware contains hardware software therefore hardware software CM concept applicable
SCM might interface organization quality assurance activity issue record management nonconforming item

A person responsible upkeep configuration reliable operation especially computer
The system administrator seek ensure computer manages meet need without exceeding set
To meet need system administrator may acquire install upgrade computer component software provide routine automation maintain security policy train supervise staff offer project
Many organization staff job related system administration
In larger company may separate position within computer support Information Services IS department
In smaller group may shared sysadmins even single person
There multiple path part becoming system administrator
Many system administrator degree related field information system even trade school program
On top nowadays company require IT certification
Other school offshoot Computer Science program specifically system administration
An alternate path becoming system administrator simply dive without formal training learning system need support work
This common route informally trained system administration often result small organization lack IT department gradually growing need complexity
For example shared desktop computer also acting file server becomes slow need everyone someone decides take job setting dedicated server learn specific requirement perform task without formal training
This spread staff asking person help finding solution problem needed slowly becoming generally person system management organization
These informally trained system administrator could regarded work support need organization customer
Some school started offering undergraduate degree System Administration
The first started
Others recently offered degree Information Technology
Pune India offer master degree Computers Applications specialization System Administration
The offer Integrated Information Technology
degree specializing product support
Several university including Rochester Institute Technology program system administration
In special MSc program organized cooperation named Masters programme Network System Administration
There also BSc Network System Administration offered
UvA offer similar program cooperation HvA named Master System Network Engineering
Many school world offer related graduate degree field network system computer security
One primary difficulty teaching system administration formal university discipline industry technology change much faster typical textbook coursework certification process
By time new textbook spent year working approval committee specific technology written may changed significantly become obsolete
In addition practical nature system administration easy availability software many system administrator enter field
Some learning institution reluctant teach effect hacking undergraduate level student
Generally prospective required experience computer system expected manage
In case candidate expected posse industry certification Microsoft Red Hat Novell Cisco Linux Foundation Certified Engineer Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator among others
Sometimes almost exclusively smaller site role system administrator may given skilled user addition replacement duty
The system administration includes computer system way people use organization
This entail knowledge well hardware software also knowledge purpose people organization use computer
Perhaps important skill system administrator various sort constraint stress
The sysadmin call computer system go malfunction must able quickly correctly diagnose wrong best fix
They may also need teamwork communication skill well able install configure hardware software
Sysadmins must understand behavior software order deploy troubleshoot problem generally know several used automation routine task
A typical sysadmin role design write new application software responsible automating system application configuration various configuration management tool line somewhat blur
Depending sysadmin role skillset may expected understand equivalent concept software engineer understands
That said system administrator job title sense
Particularly dealing system sysadmin must strong grasp
This includes merely deploying software patch also preventing security problem preventive measure
In organization computer security administration separate role responsible overall security upkeep sysadmins generally responsible security computer system
A system administrator responsibility might include In larger organization task may divided among different system administrator member different organizational group
For example dedicated individual may apply system upgrade team may perform testing validation one may responsible technical documentation written company
System administrator larger organization tend
In smaller organization system administrator might also act technical support Storage SAN Administrator

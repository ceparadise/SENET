A small scale preliminary study conducted order evaluate feasibility time cost adverse event effect size statistical variability attempt predict appropriate sample size improve upon study design prior performance research project
Pilot study therefore may appropriate
Pilot experiment frequently carried attempt avoid time money wasted inadequately designed project
A pilot study usually carried member relevant population form part final sample
This may influence later behaviour research subject already involved research
A pilot often used test design experiment adjusted
It potentially valuable insight anything missing pilot study added expensive experiment improve chance clear outcome
In pilot study referred study help identify design issue main research done
Although pilot experiment tradition public action usefulness strategy change questioned least domain environmental management
It argued extrapolation pilot study large scale environmental strategy assumed possible partly due exceptional resource favourable condition often accompany pilot study

All pilot paid transport passenger cargo must commercial pilot license instrument rating issued FAA
Helicopter pilot also must hold commercial pilot license helicopter rating
Although small airline hire high school graduate airline require least year college prefer hire college graduate
In fact entrant occupation college degree
Because number applicant continues increase many employer making college degree educational requirement
For example test pilot often required engineering degree
Pilots also need flight experience qualify license
Completing class flight school approved FAA reduce amount flight experience required pilot license
In FAA certified civilian flying school including college university offer degree credit pilot training
Initial training airline pilot typically includes week company indoctrination week ground school simulator training hour initial operating experience including FAA aviation safety inspector
Once trained pilot required attend recurrent training simulator check twice year throughout career
Depending type aircraft new airline pilot start first officer flight engineer
Although airline favor applicant already flight engineer license may provide flight engineer training commercial license
Many pilot begin smaller regional commuter airline obtain experience flying passenger scheduled flight busy airport weather condition
These job often lead higher paying job bigger national major airline
Companies airline usually require le flying experience
However commercial pilot license minimum requirement employer prefer applicant experience type craft flying
New employee usually start first officer fly equipment
Pilots highly trained professional fly airplane helicopter carry wide variety task
Most airline pilot copilot flight engineer transport passenger cargo
However pilot commercial pilot involved dusting crop spreading seed reforestation testing aircraft flying passenger cargo area served regular airline directing firefighting effort tracking criminal monitoring traffic rescuing evacuating injured person
Before departure pilot plan flight carefully
They thoroughly check aircraft make sure engine control instrument system functioning properly
They also make sure baggage cargo loaded correctly
They confer flight dispatcher aviation weather forecaster find weather condition en route destination
Based information choose route altitude speed provide safest economical smoothest flight
When flying instrument flight governing operation aircraft poor pilot command company dispatcher normally file instrument flight plan air traffic control flight coordinated air traffic
Takeoff landing difficult part flight require close coordination two pilot
Unless weather bad though flight relatively routine
Airplane pilot assistance autopilot flight management computer steer plane along planned route monitored air traffic control station pas along way
They regularly scan instrument panel check fuel supply condition engine hydraulic system
Pilots may request change altitude route circumstance dictate
They must also monitor warning device designed help detect sudden shift wind condition cause crash
Pilots must rely completely instrument visibility poor
On basis altimeter reading know high ground whether fly safely mountain obstacle
Special navigation radio give pilot precise information help special chart tell exact position
Other sophisticated equipment provides direction point end runway enables pilot land completely without outside visual reference
Once ground pilot must complete record flight aircraft maintenance status company FAA
The number nonflying duty pilot depends employment setting
Airline pilot service large support staff consequently perform nonflying duty
However large number passenger airline pilot may called upon coordinate handling disgruntled disruptive passenger
Also Federal Flight Deck Officer program airline pilot undergo rigorous training screening deputized federal law enforcement officer issued firearm protect cockpit intruder hijacker
Pilots employed organization charter operator business many duty
They may load aircraft handle passenger luggage ensure balanced load supervise refueling nonflying responsibility include keeping record scheduling flight arranging major maintenance performing minor aircraft maintenance repair
Some pilot flight instructor
They teach student class simulator plane helicopter
A specially trained pilot examiner check pilot
They periodically fly pilot pilot license applicant make sure proficient
Most pilot spend considerable amount time away home majority flight involve overnight layover
When pilot away home airline provide hotel accommodation transportation hotel airport allowance meal expense
Airline pilot especially international route often experience jet caused many hour flying different time zone
To guard pilot fatigue could result unsafe flying condition FAA requires airline allow pilot least hour uninterrupted rest hour finishing flight duty
Commercial pilot face type job hazard
The work test pilot check flight performance new experimental plane may dangerous
Pilots may exposed toxic chemical seldom benefit regular landing strip
Helicopter pilot involved rescue police work may subject personal injury
Although flying involve much physical effort mental stress responsible safe flight regardless weather tiring
Pilots must alert quick react something go wrong particularly takeoff landing
FAA regulation limit flying time airline pilot large aircraft maximum hour month hour year
Most airline pilot fly average hour month work least additional hour month performing nonflying duty
Most pilot variable work schedule working several day several day
Airlines operate flight hour day night work schedule often irregular
Flight assignment based seniority sooner pilot hired stronger bidding power preferred assignment
Commercial pilot also may irregular schedule flying hour one month hour next
Because pilot frequently many nonflying responsibility much le free time airline pilot
Except corporate flight department pilot commercial pilot remain away home overnight
But may work odd hour
However company owns fleet plane pilot may fly regular schedule
Flight instructor may irregular seasonal work schedule depending student available time weather
Instructors frequently work evening weekend

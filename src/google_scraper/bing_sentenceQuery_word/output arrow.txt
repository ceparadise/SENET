In used describe fashion
First proposed computer scientist generalization arrow provide way expressing relationship step computation
Unlike monad arrow limit step one one input
As result found use among application
While arrow use recognized distinct class Hughes would publish first definition
Until monad proven sufficient problem requiring combination program logic pure code
However useful library certain efficient parser defied rewriting monadic form
The formal concept arrow developed explain exception monadic code process monad turned arrow
Since arrow active area research
Their underlying law operation refined several time recent formulation arrow calculus requiring five law
In form proper subset Hughes arrow
While believed arrow time since proven arrow even general
In fact arrow merely equivalent directly equal Freyd category
Like type class arrow thought set quality applied
In arrow allow represented Haskell symbol combine form
However actual term arrow may also come fact arrow correspond also known arrow category theory different Kleisli category
As relatively new concept single standard definition formulation logically equivalent feature required method strictly obey certain mathematical law
The description currently used Haskell two basic operation Although two procedure strictly necessary define arrow method derived make arrow easier work practice theory
As arrow third operation class category One helpful method derived combination previous three In addition procedure arrow must obey certain rule type may applied The remaining law restrict piping method behaves order composition reversed also allowing simplifying Arrows may extended fit specific situation defining additional operation restriction
Commonly used version include arrow choice allow computation make decision arrow allow step take output input
Another set arrow known arrow application rarely used practice actually equivalent monad
Arrows several benefit mostly stemming ability make program logic explicit yet concise
Besides avoiding creates opportunity
This turn theoretically lead better easier feature like
Although program strictly requires arrow generalize away much dense pure declarative code would otherwise require
They also encourage giving common linkage program step class definition
The ability apply type generically also contributes reusability keep simple
Arrows disadvantage including initial effort defining arrow satisfies arrow law
Because monad usually easier implement extra feature arrow may unnecessary often preferable use monad
Another issue applies many construct efficiently code arrow style used computer

Pseudocode way writing code
It used design phase project quick way devising algorithm language used known without needing spend much time using exact syntax correct
Once pseudocode algorithm written easier use help write program code
Pseudocode structured way writing algorithm look much like program code
When devising algorithm programmer need use variable assign value
Many language require variable defined given data type use
The five basic data type used include Assigning value variable indicated pseudocode using arrow symbol
The arrow point value assigned towards variable assigned
The following line pseudocode read becomes equal
totalling
Sum Sum Number counting
Count Count The assignment operator also used finding total shown following example x becomes equal plus b
Similarly also use assignment operator counting assigning variable become equal value plus
INPUT OUTPUT
READ PRINT Output act returning data user program
This could form written message numerical value image video sound
This shown pseudocode writing OUTPUT followed output
The example show would output message World Sometimes word PRINT may used instead OUTPUT following example Input hand expect value provided user
The following example output message asking user input name assign variable called
The word READ also used instead INPUT
The use selection allows decision made within algorithm based certain condition
An IF statement start condition tested
If condition evaluates TRUE THEN code block run
If condition evaluates false ELSE block run
In following example Hello printed x otherwise Goodbye printed
Often ELSE IF used one condition check
The following example would print Hello x How
x otherwise print Goodbye
This structure used many possible outcome condition
For instance extend example suppose wanted program print different message depending value variable xː In example x print Hello x How
x I fine
x print Have good dayǃ
If x equal anything else print Goodbye
Iteration used need repeat block code
We make code block repeat either given number repetition continuously either long condition continues true condition becomes true
The FOR loop used repeat code given number repetition
We specify counter variable set initial value specify end value
After every iteration loop counter variable automatically incremented
In following example x start increase every time code repeat reach value loop terminate
A REPEAT loop repeat code block given condition true
The condition checked code run regardless whether condition true code always run least
The following example continue take user input user input value le
This structure often used validation check
In WHILE loop code block run continue run given condition longer true
A WHILE loop similar REPEAT loop decides terminate based condition
However loop check condition prior running first time
If condition true code block never run
The example also used input validation
Flowcharts alternative pseudocode
They used describe algorithm form diagram
Different symbol used represent different structure described
Below example flowchart algorithm

Flowcharts ideal diagram visually representing business process
For example need show flow process various department within organization use flowchart
This paper provides visual representation basic flowchart symbol proposed use communicating structure web site well correlation developing instructional project
A typical flowchart older Computer Science textbook may following kind symbol
may contain symbol usually represented circle represent converging path flow chart
Circles one arrow coming one going
Some flow chart may arrow pointing another arrow instead
These useful represent iterative process Computer Science called loop
A loop may example consists connector control first enters processing step conditional one arrow exiting loop one going back connector
connector often used signify connection part process held another sheet screen
A flowchart described page divided different lane describing control different organization unit
An unit appearing particular lane within control organizational unit
This technique allows analyst locate responsibility performing action making decision correctly allowing relationship different organizational unit responsibility single process
Flowcharts use special shape represent different type action step process
Lines arrow show sequence step relationship
See use instantly
refer individual web page may may contain multiple element
Workflow relationship work done different department fixed sequence
This mean one department need finish job work continue another department
The development maintenance work flow relationship important manager depend preceding area work responsible manager worker different stage chain
The following shape similar basic flowchart symbol specially used audit flowchart
Edraw Max perfect flowchart organizational chart mind map also network diagram floor plan workflow fashion design UML diagram electrical diagram science illustration chart graph beginning

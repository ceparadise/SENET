term used describe style computer programming focus mechanism extend
Extensible programming language supporting style programming active area work movement marginalized
Extensible programming become topic renewed interest century
The first paper usually associated extensible programming language movement paper programming language
Another early description principle extensibility occurs Brooker Morris paper
The peak movement marked two academic symposium
By survey article movement Thomas Standish essentially post mortem
The exception went essentially unnoticed
As typically envisioned extensible programming language consisted base language providing elementary computing facility capable modifying base language
A program consisted modification code modified base language
The prominent technique used movement macro definition
Grammar modification also closely associated movement resulting eventual development
The language community remained separate extensible language community apparently one researcher observed programming language program data essentially interchangeable regarded extendible sic language
seen easily fact Lisp used extendible language year
At conference presented extensible programming language
Standish described three class language extension called otherwise paraphrase metaphrase term
Standish attributed failure extensibility movement difficulty programming successive extension
An ordinary programmer might build single shell macro around base language second shell macro built around programmer would intimately familiar base language first shell third shell would require familiarity base first second shell
Note shielding programmer detail intent movement supplanted extensibility movement
Despite earlier presentation Simula extensible Standish survey seem practice included newer technology though used general definition extensibility technically could included
A history programming abstraction invention computer present day made mention macro gave hint extensible language movement ever occurred
Macros tentatively admitted abstraction movement late perhaps due advent granted pseudonym
In modern sense system support extensible programming provide feature described
This simply mean source language compiled must closed fixed static
It must possible add new keywords concept structure source language
Languages allow addition construct user defined syntax include
While acceptable fundamental intrinsic language feature immutable system must rely solely language feature
It must possible add new one
In extensible programming compiler monolithic program convert source code input binary executable output
The compiler must extensible point really collection plugins assist translation source language input
For example extensible compiler support generation object code code documentation source code desired output
The architecture compiler must permit user get inside compilation process provide alternative processing task every reasonable step compilation process
For task translating source code something executed computer extensible compiler At runtime extensible programming system must permit language extend set operation permit
For example system us interpreter must allow new value defined
As extensible syntax acceptable smallish set fundamental intrinsic operation immutable
However must possible overload augment intrinsic operation new additional behavior supported
Extensible programming system regard program data processed
Those program completely devoid kind formatting information
The visual display editing program user translation function supported extensible compiler translates program data form suitable viewing editing
Naturally translation
This important must possible easily process extensible program way
It unacceptable us source language input editing viewing translation machine code
The arbitrary processing program facilitated source input specification processed formatted stored displayed edited etc
Extensible programming system must support debugging program using construct original source language regardless extension transformation program undergone order make executable
Most notably assumed way display runtime data
The debugger correctly inspector must permit display runtime data form suitable source language
For example language support data structure must possible debugger display data structure form provided plugin

principle implementation take future growth consideration
The term extensibility also seen systemic measure ability extend level effort required implement extension
Extensions addition new functionality modification existing functionality
The central theme provide change typically enhancement minimizing impact existing system function
An extensible one whose internal structure minimally affected new modified functionality example recompiling changing original might unnecessary changing system behavior either creator programmer
Because software system long lived modified new feature added functionality demanded user extensibility enables developer expand add software capability facilitates systematic reuse
Some approach include facility allowing user program routine inserted ability define new data type well define new formatting markup tag
Extensible design software engineering accept everything designed advance
A light allows change provided instead
Small command made prevent losing element extensibility following principle separating work element comprehensible unit order avoid traditional issue including low high allow continued development
Embracing change essential extensible design addition continual
Each chunk system workable change idea change addition center whole system design
Extensible design support frequent allows functionality implemented small step upon request principle advocated Agile methodology iterative development
Extensibility imposes fewer cleaner dependency development well reduced coupling cohesive abstraction plus well defined interface
Fickleness lie basis software human phenomenon since software evolving entity developed maintained human being yielding ongoing system change software specification implementation
Components software often developed deployed unrelated party independently
Adaptable software component necessary since component external vendor unlikely fit specific deployment scenario taking third party user manufacturer consideration
Many software system software derived base system share common sometimes large part functionality implementation possibly equipped different component require extensible base system
Building software system important challenge
An system allows two people independently develop extension system also allows two extension combined without global integrity check
There three different form software extensibility extensibility extensibility extensibility based artifact way changed
Under form extensibility software system extended modifying flexible least restrictive form
There two extensibility extensibility extensibility depending change applied
Changes performed invasively extensible system
original source code directly hacked
It requires available source code modification permitted source code license
extensibility relevant bug fixing internal code refactoring production next version software product
extensibility also called architecture driven framework allows software system extended available source code may allow code modified
Extensions separated original system way original system affected
One example form extensibility application framework achieve extensibility typically using inheritance dynamic binding
In extensibility also called framework detail system implementation used implementing deployment extension provided
This type approach limited various approach
extension typically achieved system configuration application use scripting language defining component interface
extensibility compromise pure pure approach rely fully exposure source code
Programmers could given system specialization interface list available abstraction refinement specification extension developed
Extensibility reusability many emphasized property common including low coupling modularity high cohesion
Software reusability boosted extensibility refers software element ability construct many different software system motivated observation software system often sharing common element
Reusability together extensibility allows technology transferred another project le development maintenance time well enhanced reliability consistency
Modern operating system support extensibility
Many modern application support extensibility etc
The trend increasing extensibility negatively affect software security
CGI one primary mean web server provide extensibility
Some people see CGI script enormous security hole

Portability relation software measure easily application transferred one computer environment another
A computer software application considered portable new environment effort required adapt new environment within reasonable limit
The meaning abstract term depends upon nature application often difficult express quantifiable unit
The phrase port mean modify software make adaptable work different computer system
For example port application Linux mean modify program run Linux environment
Portability refers ability application move across environment across platform
To clarify computer platform generally refers operating system computer hardware
A computer environment much broader may include hardware operating system interface software user programmer
Portability form reusability
Some kind software known le portable others
An example software portable would assembly code since assembly code specific processor type
No software perfectly portable software limitation
Some programming language fairly portable example C language
C compiler readily available majority operating system turn make C program portable
This portability C language program resulted programmer program recompiling C make much portable
Portability also used describe flexibility use data
Some file format le portable others
For example view file file format PDF JPEG format depend availability appropriate software application

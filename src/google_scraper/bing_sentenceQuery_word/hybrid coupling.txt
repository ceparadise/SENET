Coupling term occur together frequently
Coupling refers interdependency module cohesion describes related function within single module
Low cohesion implies given module performs task related hence create problem module becomes large
Coupling Software Engineering describes version metric associated concept
For data control flow coupling For global coupling For environmental coupling make value larger coupled module
This number range approximately low coupling highly coupled For example module single input output data parameter If module input output data parameter equal number control parameter access item global data

In software development coupling refers degree software component dependant upon

In architecture component remain autonomous allow software manage communication
In decoupled architecture component operate completely separately independently

In degree program module relies one module
Coupling usually contrasted
Low coupling often correlate high cohesion vice versa
The coupling cohesion invented original developer Structured Design also early proponent concept see also
Coupling low also loose weak high also tight strong
Low coupling refers relationship one module interacts another module stable interface need concerned module internal implementation see
With low coupling change one module require change implementation another module
Low coupling often sign combined high cohesion support general goal high readability maintainability
Systems exhibit low coupling might experience following developmental difficulty The concept coupling usually related concept low coupling facilitates high cohesion vice versa
For example one approach increasing cohesion seek limit responsibility module along functionality coupling increase two class Low coupling may also reduce performance system sometimes desirable achieve maximum efficiency
Regardless many modern computing system cost reduced performance often seen worthy trade benefit process result low coupling
Some type coupling order highest lowest coupling follows High cohesion low coupling attribute good design
Coupling Software Engineering describes version metric associated concept
For data control flow coupling For global coupling For environmental coupling Coupling C g w r For example module single input output data parameter C If module input output data parameter equal number control parameter access item global data C Very loosely coupled system added advantage tend build quickly
This due low amount dependency
Systems allow object communicate without know anything implementation
Both system even allow object communicate object written language
The fact object may built independently reduces amount recompilation required change applied
Hidden implicit dependency make code hard test hard reuse
So one explicitly declare dependency

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I recently noticed decoupling topic question want know apply
By apply I mean Is relevant compiled language like C Java involved
Should I know study web developer
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
term describes relationship two entity software system usually class
When class us another class communicates said class class
At least one
The idea try keep coupling class system possible hence coupling sometimes although English would mean coupling people often use imply coupling entity
Often class object
When ClassA depends heavily ClassB chance ClassA affected ClassB changed high
This strong coupling
However ClassA depends lightly ClassB chance ClassA affected way change code ClassB low
This loose coupling relationship
Loose coupling good want component system heavily depend
We want keep system modular When two part loosely coupled independent le likely break change
For example building car would want internal change engine break something steering wheel
While would never happen accident building car similar thing happen programmer time
Loose coupling meant reduce risk thing happening
Strong coupling usually occurs entity A know much entity B
This one assumption entity B incorrect
For example imagine driver would make certain assumption engine car work
The day buy new car engine work differently reason engine replaced previous assumption would incorrect
If code computer would incorrect code work properly
However assumption driver made car steering wheel brake gas pedal change car wo affect long assumption stay correct
This loose coupling
The idea class hide internal detail class offer strictly defined interface class communicate
So example defining class Car interface public method would probably
These method object invoke Car object
All detail Car class engine work kind fuel us etc
hidden class prevent knowing much Car
The moment class A know much class B strongly coupled relationship class A dependent class B change class B likely affect class A
A relationship two entity know little necessary loosely coupled decoupled relationship
Decoupling generally seeing whether two thing need closely work together made independent
Independence great make thing easy change use somewhere else
Decoupling applied many area development especially true temporal decoupling even applied daily life extent
Also noting many type coupling software development consider covered answer
You research
Two thing coupled dependency
If A depends B use B without taking A consideration
If want use A also carry B A depends
In software development usually ca remove coupling component completely
Decoupling context normally mean existing coupling
That making sure component know little possible component around
This probably common type coupling found wild Here DisplayFriends needlessly manually operating connection behind Facebook client order get need
class coupled
If FacebookClient suddenly change kind connection us app wo able get Facebook friend anymore
We remove coupling DisplayFriends class Connection asking FacebookClient provide need u
Now really care FacebookClient get friend
All really care fact get
Any change brought internal behavior wo damage class
This kind decoupling easily achieved following Law Demeter function say quoting Wikipedia The Law Demeter function requires method object O may invoke method following kind object Since I mentioned temporal coupling beginning answer I going shortly describe
Temporal coupling normally considered designing application execute algorithm parallel
Consider two executable unit actual instruction method whatever wish consider unit A B
We say A temporally coupled B B must executed A executed
If A temporally coupled B A B executed time
Build example one think usual thing daily life
Are two thing one could time
Finally answer last bit Should I know study web developer
Yes
For example one popular design pattern web development MVC decoupling
The answer good job describing decoupling
I wanted discus final question
Should I know study web developer
The answer emphatic yes
It matter kind developer
You could web developer embedded system developer
Let say class generates custom URLs placed web page
You might tempted class write URLs directly page placing href tag
This might seem simpler first
But happens need make change put link email send user
Your current code would work URL generator tightly coupled web framework using
The better option would URL generator class return URL string
This could used web code could also used email code
It may seem like work upfront decoupled code effort pay time
Having code modularized decoupled make code understandable testable maintainable matter programming domain working

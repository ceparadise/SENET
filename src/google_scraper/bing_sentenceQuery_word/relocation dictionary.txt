process assigning load address locatable code program adjusting code data program reflect assigned address
A usually performs relocation conjunction process searching file library replace symbolic reference name actual usable address running program
Relocation typically done linker also done relocating running program
Some architecture avoid relocation entirely deferring run time known
segmented various type
Example segment include others
The relocation table list created translator stored object executable file
Each entry table fixup absolute address object code must changed loader relocates program refer correct location
Fixups designed support relocation program complete unit
In case fixup table relative base address zero fixups must changed loader move table
In architecture fixup cross certain boundary segment boundary aligned word boundary illegal flagged error linker
Far pointer offset used address space available point code data within absolute segment actual depends program loaded memory known program loaded
Instead segment relative value DOS EXE file
These segment need corrected executable loaded memory
The EXE us relocation table find segment need adjusted
With Windows operating system mandatory provide relocation table EXE file since first image loaded virtual address space thus loaded preferred base address
For DLLs EXEs opt exploit mitigation technique introduced Windows Vista relocation table become mandatory possibility binary may dynamically moved executed even though still first thing loaded virtual address space
When running native binary Windows Vista ASLR Address Space Layout Randomization mandatory thus relocation section omitted compiler
The executable format shared library format used system allows several type relocation defined
The linker read segment information relocation table object file performs relocation The following example us architecture MIXAL assembly language
The principle architecture though detail change

It seems important part relocation discussed article
That nature processor often include absolute address within machine encoding sometimes must altered order program properly execute
For instance program written microprocessor execute one base address loaded different base address must absolute address expressed instruction altered properly executable new base address
July UTC The article miss different type relocation The article survived AfD
I argued merging article agreement
Both article stub merged article would stronger eventually cover concept static dynamic virtual relocation
And rebasing
September UTC Rebasing rebasing relocation relocation context call thing rebasing rebasing everyone call way
It Wikipedia pedagological responsibility tell people word use
Of course two equally good option opinion February UTC I propose merger reason I believe pretty obvious uncontroversial
I also think article title subject technical concept rather theoretical one
Ian September UTC This simply true In computer science relocation process replacing symbolic reference name library actual usable address memory running program
Relocation nothing symbolic reference
I also tinkered article opinion merged general discussion various type relocation
November UTC Previously I suggested example illustrate relocation
I tinkered one
Rather add article I thought I discussion
This example us Donald Knuth architecture MIXAL assembly language
The principle architecture though detail change

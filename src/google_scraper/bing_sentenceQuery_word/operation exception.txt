process responding occurrence anomalous exceptional condition requiring special processing often changing normal flow
It provided specialized construct mechanism like facility like
In general exception break normal flow execution executes
The detail done depends whether hardware software exception software exception implemented
Some exception especially hardware one may handled gracefully execution resume interrupted
Alternative approach exception handling software error checking maintains normal program flow later explicit check contingency reported using special return value auxiliary global variable C floating point status flag input validation preemptively filter exceptional case
Hardware exception mechanism processed CPU
It intended support error detection redirects program flow error handling service routine
The state exception saved stack
Exception handling hardware standard refers general exceptional condition defines exception event occurs operation particular operand outcome suitable every reasonable application
That operation might signal one exception invoking default explicitly requested alternate handling
By default IEEE exception resumable handled substituting predefined value different exception
infinity divide zero exception providing later checking whether exception occurred see typical example handling IEEE exception
An style enabled use status flag involves first computing expression using fast direct implementation checking whether failed testing status flag necessary calling slower numerically robust implementation
The IEEE standard us term trapping refer calling routine exceptional condition optional feature standard
The standard recommends several usage scenario including implementation value followed resumption concisely handle
The default IEEE exception handling behaviour resumption following default value avoids risk inherent changing flow program control numerical exception
For example ended catastrophic explosion due part programming language exception handling policy aborting computation arithmetic error case floating point integer conversion
In Ariane Flight case programmer protected four seven critical variable overflow due concern computational constraint computer relied turned incorrect assumption possible range value three unprotected variable Ariane assumption correct
According loss Flight would avoided IEEE policy default substitution used overflowing conversion caused software abort occurred piece code turned completely unnecessary Ariane
The official report crash conducted inquiry board headed noted An underlying theme development Ariane bias towards
The supplier SRI following specification given stipulated event detected exception processor stopped
The exception occurred due random failure design error
The exception detected inappropriately handled view taken software considered correct shown fault
Although failure due systematic software design error mechanism introduced mitigate type problem
For example computer within SRIs could continued provide best estimate required information
There reason concern software exception allowed even required cause processor halt handling equipment
Indeed loss proper software function hazardous software run SRI unit
In case Ariane resulted two still healthy critical unit equipment
From processing point view hardware similar resumable exception though typically unrelated user program
The may provide facility handling exception program via
Typically interrupt caused execution process handled interrupt service routine operating system operating system may send process may asked operating system register signal handler called signal raised let operating system execute default action like terminating program
Typical example
Software exception handling support provided software tool differs somewhat understood exception handling hardware similar concept involved
In programming language mechanism exception handling term typically used specific sense denote data structure storing information exceptional condition
One mechanism transfer control exception known
The exception said
Execution transferred catch
From point view author raising exception useful way signal routine could execute normally example input argument invalid
value outside resource relies unavailable like missing file hard disk error error
In system without exception routine would need return special
However sometimes complicated user routine need write extra code distinguish normal return value erroneous one
Programming language differ substantially notion exception
Contemporary language roughly divided two group Kiniry also note Language design partially influence use exception consequently manner one handle partial total failure system execution
The major influence example use typically core library code example technical book magazine article online discussion forum organization code standard
Contemporary application face many design challenge considering exception handling strategy
Particularly modern enterprise level application exception must often cross process boundary machine boundary
Part designing solid exception handling strategy recognizing process failed point economically handled software portion process
Software exception handling developed
This originated exception keyword returned case error instead terminating program entering debugger
Error introduced late via keyword
This rapidly used error raising control flow thus augmented two new keywords MacLisp June reserving error handling
The cleanup behavior generally called finally introduced New Implementation LISP
This adopted
Contemporary Scheme handled exception closure
The first paper structured exception handling
Exception handling subsequently widely adopted many programming language onward
Originally software exception handling included resumable exception resumption semantics like hardware exception exception termination semantics
However resumption semantics considered ineffective practice see standardization discussion quoted longer common use though provided programming language like Common Lisp Dylan
Exception handling mechanism contemporary language typically termination semantics opposed hardware exception typically resumable
This based experience using theoretical design argument favor either decision extensively debated standardization discussion resulted definitive decision termination semantics
On rationale design mechanism note A Palo Alto standardization meeting November heard brilliant summary argument termination semantics backed personal experience data Sun formerly Xerox PARC
Jim used exception handling half dozen language period year early proponent resumption semantics one main designer implementers Xerox system
His message He backed statement experience several operating system
The key example It written people liked used resumption ten year use one use resumption left half million line system context inquiry
Because resumption actually necessary context inquiry removed found significant speed increase part system
In every case resumption used ten year become problem appropriate design replaced
Basically every use resumption represented failure keep separate level abstraction disjoint
A contrasting view safety exception handling given describing plethora feature notational convention many unnecessary like exception handling even dangerous
Do allow language present state used application reliability critical
The next rocket go astray result programming language error may exploratory space rocket harmless trip Venus It may nuclear warhead exploding one city
Exception handling often handled correctly software especially multiple source exception million line Java code found exception handling defect
Citing multiple prior study others result Weimer Necula wrote significant problem exception create hidden path difficult programmer reason
initially released exception handling explicitly omitted developer arguing obfuscated
Later mechanism added language Go author advise using unrecoverable error halt entire process
One case early criticism exception handling dealing resource leak state inconsistency escaping section locked one temporarily holding file open
The one approach handle
Many computer language support exception exception handling
This includes
like version language
Exception handling commonly resumable language exception thrown program search back function call exception handler found
Some language call stack search progress
That function containing handler exception call function turn call function exception occurs function may terminated handle
An language without unwinding
Common Lisp call exception handler unwind stack
This allows program continue computation exactly place error occurred example previously missing file become available
The stackless implementation programming language support exception handling without stack unwinding
Excluding minor syntactic difference couple exception handling style use
In popular style exception initiated special statement exception object
Java Object Pascal value special extendable enumerated type
Ada SML
The scope exception handler start marker clause language block starter end start first handler clause
Several handler clause follow specify exception type handle name us exception object
A language also permit clause used case exception occurred end handler scope reached
More common related clause executed whether exception occurred typically release resource acquired within body block
Notably provide construct since encourages RAII technique free resource using
In whole exception handling code might look like note exception type called would need declared somewhere As minor variation language use single handler clause deal class exception internally
According paper Westley Wiemer syntax block Java contributing factor software defect
When method need handle acquisition release resource programmer apparently unwilling nest enough block due readability concern even would correct solution
It possible use single block even dealing multiple resource requires correct use another common source bug type problem
Regarding semantics construct general Wiemer Necula write While conceptually simple complicated execution description language specification Gosling et al
requires four level nested official English description
In short contains large number programmer often overlook
C support various mean error checking generally considered support exception handling although used implement exception semantics
optional support structured exception handling
support exception handling pervasive consistent
It difficult write robust Python program without using keywords
The implementation exception handling programming language typically involves fair amount support code generator accompanying compiler
It addition exception handling ended useful lifetime original compiler
Two scheme common
The first generates code continually update structure program state term exception handling
Typically add new element know handler available function method associated frame exception thrown pointer layout directs runtime appropriate handler code
This approach compact term space add execution overhead frame entry exit
It commonly used many Ada implementation example complex generation runtime support already needed many language feature
Dynamic registration fairly straightforward define amenable
The second scheme one implemented many compiler approach
This creates static table relate range program state respect exception handling
Then exception thrown runtime system look current instruction location table determines handler play need done
This approach minimizes executive overhead case exception thrown
This happens cost space space allocated data section loaded relocated exception actually thrown
This second approach also superior term achieving
Other definitional implementation scheme proposed well
For language support approach involve overhead advanced
A different view exception based principle supported particular
The idea provide rigorous basis exception handling defining precisely normal abnormal behavior
Specifically approach based two concept The Safe Exception Handling principle introduced Bertrand Meyer hold two meaningful way routine react exception occurs In particular simply ignoring exception permitted block must either retried successfully complete propagate exception caller
Here example expressed Eiffel syntax
It assumes routine normally better way send message may fail triggering exception algorithm next us fail le often
If fails routine whole fail causing caller get exception
The boolean local variable initialized False start
If fails body clause executed causing execution
If execution fails clause execute end clause final causing routine execution whole fail
This approach merit defining clearly normal abnormal case abnormal case causing exception one routine unable fulfill contract
It defines clear distribution role clause normal body charge achieving attempting achieve routine contract clause charge reestablishing context restarting process chance succeeding performing actual computation
Although exception Eiffel fairly clear philosophy Kiniry criticizes implementation Exceptions part language definition represented INTEGER value exception STRING value
Additionally basic value object inherent semantics beyond expressed helper routine necessarily foolproof representation overloading effect one differentiate two integer value
If exception thrown caught operationally exception thrown applicable handler specified uncaught exception handled runtime routine called
The common default behavior terminate program print error message console usually including debug information string representation exception
This often avoided handler example catch exception reach runtime
Note even though uncaught exception may result terminating abnormally program may correct exception caught notably rolling back partially completed transaction releasing resource terminates normally assuming runtime work correctly runtime controlling execution program ensure orderly shutdown process
In multithreaded program uncaught exception thread may instead result termination thread entire process uncaught exception handler caught handler
This particularly important server example running thread terminated without server overall affected
This default uncaught exception handler may overridden either globally example provide alternative logging reporting uncaught exception restart thread terminate due uncaught exception
For example Java done single thread via globally via Python done modifying
The designer Java devised checked exception special set exception
The checked exception method may raise part method
For instance method might throw must declare fact explicitly method signature
Failure raise error
Kiniry note however Java library often inconsistent approach error reporting Not erroneous situation Java represented exception though
Many method return special value indicate failure encoded constant field related class
Checked exception related exception checker exist programming language
The external tool OCaml invisible
require syntactic annotation optional
possible compile run program without checked exception although recommended production code
The feature interface closer Java introduced later
A function could raise exception listed type leaking exception called function would automatically turned sole runtime exception instead resulting error
Later similar feature
These feature include compile time checking central concept checked exception incorporated major programming language Java
Early version programming language included optional mechanism checked exception called
By default function could throw exception limited clause added function signature specified exception function may throw
Exception specification enforced
Violations resulted global function called
An empty exception specification could given indicated function throw exception
This made default exception handling added language would required much modification existing code would impeded interaction code written language would tempted programmer writing many handler local level
Explicit use empty exception specification could however allow compiler perform significant code stack layout optimization generally suppressed exception handling may take place function
Some analyst viewed proper use exception specification difficult achieve
In recent language standard use exception specification specified version standard removed language
A function throw exception denoted noexcept keyword
In contrast Java language like C enforce exception caught
According Hanspeter Mössenböck distinguishing checked exception unchecked exception make written program convenient le robust uncaught exception result abort
Kiniry note however Java JDK version throw large number unchecked exception one every line code whereas Eiffel us much sparingly one thrown every line code
Kiniry also writes As Java programmer know volume code typical Java application sometimes larger comparable code necessary explicit formal parameter return value checking language checked exception
In fact general consensus among Java programmer dealing checked exception nearly unpleasant task writing documentation
Thus many programmer report resent checked exception
This lead abundance exception
Kiniry also note developer C apparently influenced kind user experience following quote attributed via Eric Gunnerson Examination small program lead conclusion requiring exception specification could enhance developer productivity enhance code quality experience large software project suggests different result decreased productivity little increase code quality
According fairly broad agreement design group checked exception language feature C
Hejlsberg explained interview The throw clause least way implemented Java necessarily force handle exception handle force acknowledge precisely exception might pas
It requires either catch declared exception put throw clause
To work around requirement people ridiculous thing
For example decorate every method throw Exception
That completely defeat feature made programmer write gobbledy gunk
That help Checked exception reduce incidence unhandled exception surfacing given application
Unchecked exception object remain unhandled
However checked exception either require extensive declaration revealing implementation detail reducing encourage coding poorly considered block hide legitimate exception appropriate handler
Consider growing time
An interface may declared throw exception X Y
In later version code one want throw exception Z would make new code incompatible earlier us
Furthermore one body code declares interface implemented different body code code plugged called first adapter code may rich set exception describe problem forced use exception type declared interface
It possible reduce number declared exception either declaring potentially thrown exception defining declaring exception type suitable level abstraction called method mapping lower level exception type preferably wrapped using order preserve root cause
In addition possible example changing interface calling code would need modified well since sense exception method may throw part method implicit interface anyway
Using declaration usually sufficient satisfying checking Java
While may use essentially circumvents checked exception mechanism Oracle discourages
Unchecked exception type generally handled except possibly outermost level scope
These often represent scenario allow recovery frequently reflect programming defect generally represent unrecoverable JVM failure
Even language support checked exception case use checked exception appropriate
The point exception handling routine ensure code handle error condition
In order establish exception handling routine sufficiently robust necessary present code wide spectrum invalid unexpected input created via software also sometimes referred
One difficult type software write exception handling routine protocol software since robust protocol implementation must prepared receive input comply relevant specification
In order ensure meaningful regression analysis conducted throughout exception handling testing highly automated test case must generated scientific repeatable fashion
Several commercially available system exist perform testing
In runtime engine environment exist tool attach runtime engine every time exception interest occurs record debugging information existed memory time exception thrown value
These tool called error interception tool provide information exception
Somewhat related concept checked exception
Synchronous exception happen specific program statement whereas raise practically anywhere
It follows asynchronous exception handling ca required compiler
They also difficult program
Examples naturally asynchronous event include pressing interrupt program receiving stop suspend another
Programming language typically deal limiting asynchronicity example Java deprecated use ThreadDeath exception used allow one thread stop another one
Instead exception raise suitable location program synchronously
see encompasses aforementioned exception handling system
In language environment advent condition generalisation error according implies function call late exception handler decision unwind stack may taken
Conditions generalization exception
When condition arises appropriate condition handler searched selected stack order handle condition
Conditions represent error may safely go unhandled entirely purpose may propagate hint warning toward user
This related exception handling exception said permitted return expression signaled exception taken corrective action handler
The condition system generalized thus within handler condition
possible jump predefined restart point
lie signaling expression condition handler
Restarts function closed lexical environment allowing programmer repair environment exiting condition handler completely unwinding stack even partially
Condition handling moreover provides
Restarts provide various possible mechanism recovering error select mechanism appropriate given situation
That province condition handler since located code access broader view
An example Suppose library function whose purpose parse single file entry
What function entry malformed
There one right answer library could deployed program many different purpose
In interactive browser right thing might return entry unparsed user see automated program right thing might supply null value unreadable field abort error many entry malformed
That say question answered term broader goal program known library function
Nonetheless exiting error message rarely right answer
So instead simply exiting error function may offering various way instance skip log entry supply default null value unreadable field ask user missing value unwind stack abort processing error message
The restarts offered constitute available recovering error selection restart condition handler supply

In occurs operation attempt create numeric value outside range represented given number bit either larger maximum lower minimum representable value
The common result overflow least significant representable bit result stored result said around maximum
modulo power two
An overflow condition give incorrect result particularly possibility anticipated compromise program reliability
On processor like GPUs DSPs support overflowed result would clamped
set minimum maximum value representable range rather wrapped around
The processor determines range value represented
Typical register width unsigned integer include When arithmetic operation produce result larger maximum integer overflow reduces result power retaining least significant bit result effectively causing
In particular multiplying adding two integer may result value unexpectedly small subtracting small integer may cause wrap large positive value example integer addition result similarly subtraction result representation
Such wrap around may cause security problem overflown value used number byte allocate buffer buffer allocated unexpectedly small leading potential buffer overflow arbitrary code execution
If variable type program may make assumption variable always contains positive value
An integer overflow cause value wrap become negative violates program assumption may lead unexpected behavior example integer addition result two complement
Most computer two dedicated processor flag check overflow condition
The set result addition subtraction considering operand result unsigned number fit given number bit
This indicates overflow
An immediately following operation would use content flag modify register memory location contains higher part value
The set result operation signed number sign one would predict sign operand
negative result adding two positive number
This indicates overflow occurred signed result represented form would fit given number bit
There several method handling overflow Programming language implement various mitigation method accidental overflow certain variant functional language trigger exception condition overflow since seamlessly convert internal representation number match growth eventually representing whose ability limited available memory
overflow detection implementation also available
In language native support number promoted larger size automatically overflow occur exception thrown condition signaled range constraint exists
Using language may thus helpful mitigate issue
However language situation still possible integer overflow occur
An example explicit optimization code path considered bottleneck profiler
In case Common Lisp possible using explicit declaration variable word fixnum lower type safety level zero particular code block
In Java overloaded method example like throw case overflow
CERT developed Infinitely Ranged AIR integer model largely automated mechanism eliminate integer overflow truncation using error handling
In typical work data range
An example image represents black represents white value represent varying shade gray
One operation one may want support brightening image multiplying every pixel constant
allows one blindly multiply every constant without worrying overflow sticking reasonable outcome pixel larger
become white value darker black become black
Unanticipated arithmetic overflow fairly common cause
Such overflow bug may hard discover diagnose may manifest large input data set le likely used validation test
Taking arithmetic mean two number adding dividing two done many cause error sum although resulting mean large represented hence overflow
An unhandled arithmetic overflow engine steering software primary cause crash maiden flight rocket
The software considered since used many previous flight used smaller rocket generated lower acceleration Ariane
On April announced order operator reset electrical system periodically avoid integer overflow could lead loss electrical power deployment Boeing deployed fourth quarter
The followed May
The error happens centiseconds day indicating
Overflow bug evident computer game
In arcade game due integer overflow
The game take level number user multiplies add
When reach level number large value register reset give remaining short finish level
In trying calculate number show first digit
Overflow cause famous
It also caused Far Lands Minecraft existed Infdev development period Beta however later fixed Beta still exist Pocket Edition Windows Edition version Minecraft
Microsoft IBM MACRO Assembler MASM Version likely program built Pascal compiler integer overflow signedness error stack setup code prevented running newer DOS machine emulator common configuration KB memory
The program either hang display error message exit DOS
In August Casino machine Resorts World Casino printed prize ticket result overflow bug
The Casino refused pay amount calling malfunction using defense machine clearly stated maximum payout prize higher result programming bug
The Iowa Supreme Court ruled favor Casino

I seen several question hint none make connection clear
What interrupt
What exception
please explain exception language know difference When exception interrupt
An interupt CPU signal generated hardware specific CPU instruction
These cause interupt handler executed
Things signal hardware generate interupts
An exception thought interupt affect process
I sure exact detail exception implemented interupt
Your processor going number external interrupt pin
Typically pin connected hardware used indicate external event occurs
For example using serial port UART raise raise pin connected one interrupt pin processor indicate byte received
Other peripheral like timer usb controller etc
also generate interrupt basis external event
When processor receives signal one external interrupt pin immediately jump nominated location memory start executing
The code executed typically called ISR interrupt service routine
Unless implementing driver embedded software sort unlikely ever come across ISRs
Unfortunately answer question exception little le clear different meaning listed answer page
Ron Savage answer refers software construct
This purely application level exception piece code able indicate error detected piece code
There hardware involvement
Then exception seen task
This operating system level construct used kill task something illegal like divide illegally accessing memory etc
And thirdly hardware exception
In term behaviour identical interrupt processor immediately jump nominated memory location start executing
Where exception differs interrupt exception caused illegal activity processor detected
For example MMU processor detect illegal memory access cause exception
These hardware exception initial trigger operating system perform cleanup task described paragraph
Interrupts generated device external CPU timer tick disk operation completion network packet arrival etc
program execution
Exceptions program execution
division zero accessing invalid address
Unless program executing without operating system developing OS never see raw
They caught OS handled interrupt converted form reflected back user program
signal UNIX structured exception handling SEH Windows chance handling
Interrupts indicate something external processor core requires attention
It interrupt normal flow program executes Interrupt Service Routine ISR generally return interrupt occurred
There lot variation basic theme interrupt might generated software another task might get CPU ISR
The key point interrupt occur time reason
An exception bit trickier define potentially three level meaning Certain processor PowerPC example define exception indicate sort unusual condition occurred System Reset Invalid Address virtual address translation cache miss etc
These exception also used implement breakpoints system call
In case act almost like interrupt
Some hardware exception handled OS
For example program access invalid memory
This cause hardware exception
The OS handler exception odds OS send application SIGSEGV example denoting problem
If program signal handler installed signal handler run hopefully deal situation
If signal handler program terminated suspended
I would consider window Structured Exception Handlers SEH type exception
Some language like Java C concept software exception language provides handling unforeseen unusual condition
In case exception raised point code code higher program execution stack would catch exception execute
This block
Interrupts expected occur regularly although sometimes regular cpu something important happened need taken care immediately
Exceptions supposed rule thrown software something unexpected happened chance try something least crash gracefully
I going elaborate interrupt one critical type interrupt nobody dealt yet timer
But first let back
When get interrupt interrupt handler life kernelspace run typically disables interrupt see pending business handling packet arrived network processing keystroke etc
remember still kernel point figure process supposed run next could one could different one depends scheduler run
Only one process run processor given time
And using multitasking OS way switch called context switch basically register processor get dumped memory flow pass new process process done context switch something else
So let say I write simple C program count number Fibonacci sequence something else without stopping
Or even better nothing spin inside loop
How process system get chance run
What nothing happening cause interrupt
The answer timer device constantly interrupting
And keep spinning process taking entire system
Although I note interrupt handler disable interrupt something block indefinitely take entire system
An exception processor executes code normal path
This normal operation essentially linear movement code control structure
Different language support various type exception typically used handle error program operation
An interrupt exception hardware level generally
The interrupt physical signal processor tell CPU store current state jump interrupt exception handler code
Once handler done original state restored processing continue
An interrupt always exception even intended
Interrupts might indicate These always force processor pause current activity deal raised exception resuming interrupt handler complete
In term interrupt common pitfall race condition
For instance might interrupt periodically increment global realtime clock
The clock might bit bit machine
If program reading clock get first bit word interrupt occurs interrupt handler exit process get second bit word data incoherent two word may sync
If attempt use mutex semaphore lock variable process interrupt hang waiting lock halt system deadlock unless handler process use data written carefully
It easy get trouble writing interrupt
function also another problem
If executing funcA program code take interrupt also executes funcA may end unintended consequence due shared variable static heap variable class etc
You typically want execute little code possible interrupt handler frequently set flag process real work later without worrying conflict
In way similar developing multiprocessor one reason kernel programming still considered black magic many
When talking interrupt exception generally talking close hardware level code interrupt exception often implemented part hardware part software
An interrupt event hardware manually fired assembly associated vector handler used handle interrupt event IO Completion IO Error Disk Memory Failure IO Event Mouse Move example
The interrupt give rise exception often unexpected interrupt occurs
An exception unexpected behavior often using hardware come interrupt handled separately software using interrupt handler
Programming language see almost always disguise control structure kind
In general interrupt hardware implemented trap sort
You register handler specific interrupt division data available peripheral timer expired event happens processing halt quickly process interrupt thing continue
These usually implented device driver kernel
An exception software implemented way handling error code
You set handler specific general exception
When exception occurs language start unwinding stack reach handler specific handler
At point handle exception continue quit program
Keeping thing simple
When done handling interrupt normally return interrupted
Handling exception involves throwing away successive layer currently working bubble point exception handled caught
While handling interrupt may decide throw exception mean consider interrupt exception
Exceptions interrupt since would imply possibility returning interrupted rather abort subset current activity
And noted several time already interrupt usually triggered outside entity hardware user mouse click keystroke like exception generated thrown synchronously software detecting problem exceptional condition
Iterrupts basically hardware driven like printer indiciating paper network card indicating lost connection
An exception simply error condition program detected try catch block
Like It handy way catch error happens block code handle similar fashion

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
There different type error prevent computer program working way
Three key error type
Runtime error error cause program computer crash even appears nothing wrong program code
Running often cause runtime error
This could written wrong order
Syntax error mistake way code written
program syntactically correct
Common syntax error include spelling mistake incorrect use punctuation use capital letter
This piece code designed add two number together display result There four syntax error
Can identify
The syntax error The syntactically correct code would Semantic error logical error program work produce different result designed expected
A program semantic error without error reported
This code contains semantic error
The program run obvious problem see output result
The first two line ask user suggest number value
However function return data type
If user give value first second number stored string
When add two string together eg answer
Adding together produce answer
If try program valid program error work first time
However would notice unexpected result
The correct code would require value set
However integer need output string along rest outputted message

What difference Trap Interrupt
If terminology different different system mean
A exception user process
It caused division zero invalid memory access
It also usual way invoke kernel routine run higher priority user code
Handling synchronous user code suspended continues afterwards
In sense active time code expects trap happen relies fact
An something generated hardware device like hard disk graphic card port etc
These asynchronous
happen predictable place user code passive since interrupt handler wait happen eventually
You also see trap kind interrupt since handler trap handler look like interrupt handler register stack pointer saved context switch execution resume case left
closely related
Traps type exception similar interrupt
Intel defines two overlapping category vectored event v exception class v v
All quote post April version
For definitive complex perspective I recommend reading SDM chapter Interrupt Exception handling
Vectored Events cause processor jump interrupt handler saving much processor state enough execution continue point later
Exceptions interrupt ID called vector determines interrupt handler processor jump
Interrupt handler described within Interrupt Descriptor Table
occur random time execution program response signal hardware
System hardware us interrupt handle event external processor request service peripheral device
Software also generate interrupt executing INT n instruction
occur processor detects error condition executing instruction division zero
The processor detects variety error condition including protection violation page fault internal machine fault
classified depending way reported whether instruction caused exception restarted without loss program task continuity
Summary increment instruction pointer
A exception reported immediately following execution trapping instruction
Traps allow execution program task continued without loss program continuity
The return address trap handler point instruction executed trapping instruction
A exception generally corrected corrected allows program restarted loss continuity
When fault reported processor restores machine state state prior beginning execution faulting instruction
The return address saved content CS EIP register fault handler point faulting instruction rather instruction following faulting instruction
Example A page fault often recoverable
A piece application address space may swapped disk ram
The application trigger page fault try access memory swapped
The kernel pull memory disk ram hand control back application
The application continue left faulting instruction accessing swapped memory time memory access succeed without faulting
An exception always report precise location instruction causing exception allow restart program task caused exception
Aborts used report severe error hardware error inconsistent illegal value system table
Software invoked interrupt triggered INT instruction behave manner
The instruction completes processor save state jump interrupt handler
Generally speaking term like exception fault abort mean thing called Interrupts
Coming difference Trap Interrupt Trap Is programmer initiated expected transfer control special handler routine
For ex instruction good example Where Interrupt Hardware Is program control interruption based external hardware event external CPU For ex Pressing key keyboard time timer chip A special kind commonly referred
An general term cover interrupt hardware device interrupt software
A trap called code like program used call OS routine normally synchronous
An interrupt called event many time hardware like network card received data CPU timer name suggests interrupt normal control flow CPU switch driver routine handle event
An interrupt within system
An interrupt handler summoned deal cause interrupt control returned interrupted context instruction
A trap interrupt
An interrupt used signal completion obviate need device polling
A trap used call operating system routine catch arithmetic error
I think Traps caused execution current instruction thus called synchronous event
interrupt caused independent instruction running processor related external event thus known asynchronous one
Interrupts hardware interrupt trap interrupt
Occurrences hardware interrupt usually disable hardware interrupt true trap
If need disallow hardware interrupt trap served need explicitly clear interrupt flag
And usually interrupt flag computer affect hardware interrupt opposed trap
This mean clearing flag prevent trap
Unlike trap interrupt preserve previous state CPU
A trap software write program declare variable divide zero value treated run program throw error call special version trap program asks o required service
In case interrupt general word hardware interrupt like error cpu interrupted random time course fault hardware brings

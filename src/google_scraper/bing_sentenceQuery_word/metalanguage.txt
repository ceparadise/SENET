Broadly language symbol used language discussed examined
In metalanguage language used make statement statement another language
Expressions metalanguage often distinguished object language use italic quotation mark writing separate line
The structure sentence phrase metalanguage described
There variety recognized metalanguage including
An language formally naturally firmly fixed object language
This idea found book discussion relationship formal language nature formalization number theory metalanguage embedded within
It occurs natural informal language English word even describe feature concept pertaining English language
An analogous
An example ordered metalanguage construction one metalanguage discus object language followed creation another metalanguage discus first etc
A similar ordered metalanguage level represents greater degree abstraction
However nested metalanguage differs ordered one level includes one
The example nested metalanguage come biology
Each level system incorporates one
The language used discus genus also used discus specie one used discus order also used discus genus kingdom
Natural language combine nested ordered metalanguage
In natural language infinite regress metalanguage specialized vocabulary simpler syntax
Designating language L grammar language discourse metalanguage L sublanguage nested within L
The grammar L form factual description discourse metametalanguage L also sublanguage L
The grammar L form theory describing syntactic structure factual description stated metametametalanguage L likewise sublanguage L
The grammar L form metatheory describing syntactic structure theory stated L
L succeeding metalanguage grammar L differing reference
Since metalanguage sublanguages L L nested metalanguage L sequel ordered metalanguage
Since metalanguage sublanguages L embedded language respect language whole
Metalanguages formal system resolve ultimately natural language parlance mathematician logician converse define term operation formula
There several entity commonly expressed metalanguage
In logic usually object language metalanguage discussing often metalanguage well
A consists used system
A variable set symbol metalanguage stand symbol set symbol object language
For instance sentence The symbol symbol object language metavariables metalanguage case English discussing object language
A whose subject matter theory theory theory
made metatheory theory called
A statement expressed metalanguage
Unlike theorem proved within given formal system metatheorem proved within may reference concept present
An meaning language
Michael Reddy argues much language use talk language conceptualized structured refers
This paradigm operates two distinct related framework
The view language sealed pipeline people Language transfer people thought feeling others Speakers writer insert mental content word Words container Listeners writer extract mental content word The view language open pipe spilling mental content void Speakers writer eject mental content external space Mental content reified viewed concrete space Listeners writer extract mental content space Computers follow program set instruction formal language
The development involves use metalanguage
The act working metalanguage programming known
developed John Backus Peter Naur one earliest metalanguage used computing
Examples programming language commonly find use metaprogramming include

In computer programming data management many rule method data described manipulated
These come together form simply defined language used discus another language information language
Let explore prefix better understand
With Greek origin prefix generally mean higher beyond
Consider word
This term focus physical quality characteristic life characteristic quality go beyond one physical life existence presence
In essence life viewed higher abstract general perspective
Let consider common term like
Think back grammar school learned caterpillar became butterfly
Did know standalone word defined way organism change
Well caterpillar make simple change
The caterpillar went beyond simple change became completely different organism hence term
Adding prefix word alters definition denote something higher beyond base word
As metalanguage go beyond actual language force view higher level
There variety computer programming language unique collection rule also called syntax
The web programming language HTML us
How would define metadata
Applying method defining metalanguage deduce metadata data data
The element HTML provides information web page keywords author description retrieved Internet search engine
This metadata displayed page provides bit background information page
This information displayed page used tool reference
Let focus keywords
Get FREE access day create account
When keywords defined within metadata web page search engine Bing Google Yahoo able quickly identify web page relevant keywords entered
If keywords entered user match included metadata web page code relevance page ranked higher search engine result
Certainly process involved simplified explanation illustrates data data used
Speaking search engine ever heard metasearch engine
A metasearch engine search engine search search engine
In word search engine beyond average search engine
Examples include
Metalanguage obvious necessary component computer programming language
Information language code file data even system capability extremely valuable user search engine programmer
Remember prefix simply mean beyond higher level
Metalanguage provides additional information programming language file taking user beyond code

I trying understand BNF metalanguage metasyntax
From formal language used formal language make statement formal language
language metalanguage
From structure formal grammar formal language
So I wonder formal grammar formal language metalanguage formal language
From The syntax metalanguage called
From family notation used grammar
Does mean grammar metalanguage language EBNF syntax grammar metalanguage therefore EBNF metasyntax language object language
From A describes allowable structure composition phrase sentence metalanguage used describe either natural language computer programming language
Some widely used computer language Wirth syntax notation WSN Augmented Form ABNF
Does mean EBNF metalanguage formal language formal language grammar
Thanks regard
In general informally metalanguage language used talk language possibly specify study property
For example linguist use English describe English language
As consequence English used metalanguage
To avoid confusion various quoting system used distinguish two level
For example talking small animal bark use word dog
Here dog represent word language talked possible meaning word language belongs
It bite
When language A used metalanguage talk language B B called object language
But though sometimes used formal way similar saying wheather object many conversation
In computer science well known example
The name ML actually stand metalanguage
ML initially conceived Robin Milner metalanguage develop proof small language called LCF theorem prover
Hence syntactic semantic property expressed ML
Another well known example language meta language first programming language property
Lisp program syntactically represented Lisp data structure
The semantics Lisp also expressed Lisp since first Lisp interpreter written Lisp
This work well feat since often repeated many programming language customary write first compiler language language part language
Hence language self compiling
This requires defining syntax semantics language
So effect programming language metalanguage programming language
That actually least one expect language often claim Turing power
The concept metalanguage often concern conplete object language whether natural language programming language syntax semantics
But also concern language formal language sense syntax
A mathematical formalism used describe family formal language regular set recursively enumerable metalanguage formal language
This interesting syntax metalanguage belongs language family formal language describes
The best known example BNF language Form later EBNF variant
It language used write CF grammar thus define purely syntactic language
Its syntax hence describable BNF
Hence BNF syntactically metalanguage semantically
But BNF describes CF language claim Turing power
It noted BNF CF syntax also semantics
The semantics BNF program precisely CF grammar formal language defines BNF program associate semantics
A grammar defines formal language semantics associated
Hence wrong consider BNF CF grammar
BNF CF grammar defines syntax
Regarding two preliminary quote
They expressed context formal system formal mean mathematically defined may include syntax semantics language
It contradict discussion rather confirms
A formal grammar formal language metalanguage formal language
The mathematical formalism used write grammar case metalanguage
The quote go issue I address structure syntax definition attach string formal language
It far I see quite unrelated concept metalanguage talk formal language formal language theory sense
Two different syntactic definition produce language considering string defines language
But definition implicitly associate diffrerent structure string case important
When formal language actually syntax complete language also semantics structure important usually organizing definition semantics purpose many metalanguage
As written grammar metalanguage since semantics
The formalism used write CF grammar metalanguage purely syntactic formal language defined CF grammar
EBNF language syntax semantics
A program whatever want call text description grammar written EBNF text using syntax EBNF
This text meaning defined semantics EBNF CF grammar describes
EBNF metasyntax meta language syntax
This call precision
I consider word metasyntax shorthand expression syntax metalanguage
I s meaning could
The first quote nonsense
The second quote poorly phrased rather I understand intent Extended Form EBNF family metalanguage defining syntax used express grammar
The quote context agreement I said far
The expression formal metalanguage understood formal language formal language theory sense language formally mathematically defined syntax semantics
This quote alone say EBNF widely used metalanguage computer language without precise
Actually according EBNF metalanguage one formal language formal language theory sense since talk syntax pure syntax without semantics may seen formal language
But formal language described grammar expressed EBNF
A grammar language may part language seen global object study since describe syntax
I hope clarifies thing

I reading Handbook Satisfiability Chapter History Satisfiability I found following statement Moreover predicate metalanguage language logical theory used describe sentence language language refers entity world object investigation logical theory
I two question Could help please know The language logical theory I writen Logical Theory google found book
Can I use necessary possible predicate
Could give example please
The concept metalanguage central logic
Here example
The following statement language propositional logic b The following metalanguage The formula b satisfiable
In formal logic formalism logical statement
This formalism specifies syntax semantics logical statement
For example propositional logic specify set logical connective used form logical statement syntax truth assignment variable yield truth assignment statement semantics
This constitutes object language
The metalanguage usual English prose use might refer object language
In simple situation distinguish two using logical symbolism object language natural language like English metalanguage
However exception interesting use metalanguage shortcut statement object language
For example consider following statement language ring b
This state invertible
We could also write way invertible What mean invertible stand statement object language state invertible
How different stating prose invertible
Well suppose encoding function encodes formula integer
Then meaningful consider invertible two might even equal choose denotation invertible invertible latter meaningless blue
For illustration difference I recommend reading second incompleteness theorem
logical concept concept metalanguage thought property logical statement logical statement always true tautology could true satisfiable
As think predicate domain logical statement
In philosophical discipline logic greater applicability beyond propositional predicate logic
As example possible necessary b possible necessary neither possible necessary
Every necessary statement fortiori possible

From programming language perspective metalanguage language used make statement regarding statement made another language known object language
Metalanguage help describing concept grammar object associated particular programming language
Metalanguage widely used language design analyser compiler theorem provers
It also used financial system bioinformatics similar application
Metalanguage encourages functional programming often considered impure functional language
Metalanguage mostly used describe grammar related terminology programming language
There different type metalanguage ordered nested embedded metalanguage
An ordered metalanguage similar ordered logic level greater abstraction degree
A nested metalanguage differs ordered metalanguage level including one well
An embedded metalanguage language embedded object language occurs naturally well formally
Application software often consists set instruction clear simple programming language
Metalanguage capable describing semantic syntactic property language
With different computer programming language available many language unique set rule known syntax metalanguage help deciphering rule
BNF Form example metalanguage widely used describing syntax programming language
XSL also considered metalanguage allows define file encoding XML standard need transformed formatted
Lisp another popular language make use metalanguage

programming technique ability treat program data
It mean program designed read generate analyse transform program even modify running
In case allows programmer minimize number line code express solution thus reducing development time
It also allows program greater flexibility efficiently handle new situation without recompilation
Metaprogramming used move computation generate code using compile time computation enable
The language metaprogram written called
The language program manipulated called language
The ability programming language metalanguage called reflexivity
Reflection valuable language feature facilitate metaprogramming
Metaprogramming popular using list processing language LISP
LISP hardware machine popular enabled application could process code
They frequently used artificial intelligence application
Metaprogramming enables developer write program develop code fall paradigm
Having programming language also useful known
Generic programming invokes metaprogramming facility within language allowing one write code without concern specifying data type since supplied parameter used
Metaprogramming usually work one three way
A simple example metaprogram example This script program generates new program print number
This illustration use code write code efficient way print list number
Nonetheless programmer write execute metaprogram le minute generated exactly line code amount time
A special kind metaprogram produce source code output
Quines generally recreational theoretical interest
Not metaprogramming involves generative programming
If program modifiable runtime incremental compilation available technique used perform metaprogramming without actually generating source code
probably quintessential language metaprogramming facility historical precedence simplicity power metaprogramming
In Lisp metaprogramming unquote operator typically comma introduces code evaluated program definition time rather run time see
The metaprogramming language thus identical host programming language existing Lisp routine directly reused metaprogramming desired
This approach implemented language incorporating interpreter program work directly program data
There implementation kind common language
One style metaprogramming employ DSLs
A fairly common example using DSLs involves generative metaprogramming two tool used generate let user describe language using embed complex algorithm required efficiently parse language
One benefit metaprogramming increase productivity developer get past phase learning phase
Some argue sharp learning curve make complete use metaprogramming feature take advantage
Since metaprogramming give flexibility configurability runtime misuse incorrect use metaprogramming result unwarranted unexpected error extremely difficult debug average developer
It introduce risk system make vulnerable used care
Some common problem occur due wrong use metaprogramming inability compiler identify missing configuration parameter invalid incorrect data result unknown exception different result
Due believe developer work developing feature exercise metaprogramming language platform average developer must learn use feature part convention
The derivative powerful facility often used generate complete program section program different operating system instance

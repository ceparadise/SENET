A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck
Required field marked Kathrynne Skonicki Director Media Relations Office Marketing Communications

Freelance Writer Think thing every day posting status update downloading song checking class schedule online Do think would cool design technology make device work better
To invent new one
To help make people life job easier
Then maybe right path
But first let set thing straight
Computer scientist people call printer stop working
And sit dark cubicle day without talking anyone
Whatever think computer science wrong say Dianna Xu Chair Computer Science Department Bryn Mawr Pennsylvania
So
Computer scientist use technology solve problem
They write software make computer new thing accomplish task efficiently
They create application mobile device develop website program software
And find everywhere big tech firm government agency startup nonprofit
It everyday computing say Liz Burd Chancellor Learning Teaching University Newcastle Australia
It building tool enable everyday One biggest thing computer science major learn logically think problem find way solve
Chris Stephenson Executive Director Computer Science Teachers Association add good computer scientist also understand teamwork good communicator
They work people time say including come CS background
No matter brilliant point explain someone product work code Stephenson say
Bobby Schnabel Dean School Informatics Computing chair Association Computing Machinery Education Policy Committee say student go computer science like working computer
Others want solve problem technology
Whatever passion CS degree great foundation kind job
Anokwa nine year old first programmed computer
It father used teaching journalism Indianapolis Anokwa allowed touch anyway entering online competition win faster modem
In high school started business repairing computer classmate parent
In college earned two degree one computer science Butler one electrical engineering
There Anokwa began think people could use computing change world better
After computer everywhere desk pocket inside device use every day
Software powerful say
During graduate school Anokwa spent six month volunteering public health organization Rwanda helped introduce electronic medical record system used nationwide

Its tool used world
Election observer use monitor poll Egypt health worker Kenya use track effort combat HIV Brazilians use measure illegal logging rainforest
Anokwa partner eventually started company called Nafundi consults client using tool like Open Data Kit
These day I lot programming Anokwa say
Those skill head
All skill I need I learned first couple year Brown meant study philosophy enrolled Lexington Virginia
But also liked tinkering computer
He took class logic class computer programming
It might seem like two subject anything common Brown liked relied logical thinking
It seems like straightforward correlation say
The summer graduating computer science degree went back hometown Memphis Tennessee got job lifeguarding country club
Through someone met found next job helped company find new employee department
Outside work joined informal group programmer
That met founder website called MyRepresentatives
The site make easy people live Memphis area find represents local state federal government
Brown started working site lead developer
It unpaid valuable position
He working MyRepresentatives month landed paid job Lindsey Software company design program public housing agency work today
The computer programming class Lynch took high school one favorite
I liked knowing logic understanding thing work say
How work solve problem She majored computer science Colchester Vermont learned little bit everything computing programming language mathematical principle behind technology managing website attack problem system
The biggest thing degree gave perfect foundation build career Lynch say
In experience general degree
A technical degree general Now technical analyst Esri software company us sophisticated mapping technology called geographic information system GIS
Lynch even know GIS joined Esri imagine working industry
Among thing company software used map damage Hurricane Sandy left East Coast illustrate federal government sent money different project
Lynch design application company use Esri software
In job help customer work colleague develop test application
She like different thing every day
Every month something change I get cutting edge happening field say
Umali might playing day since company Turbine develops world popular online game sometimes need play make sure everything work correctly
Turbine make game like Dungeons Dragons The Lord Rings
Umali work behind scene keep game running smoothly making sure user sign want play list top player date
It energetic dynamic environment say
Umali graduated computer science degree Troy New York
Since several job software industry managing data people access need
Technology changed lot since college Umali say computer science major taught timeless skill like examine process information
They taught u principle break problem manageable piece say

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

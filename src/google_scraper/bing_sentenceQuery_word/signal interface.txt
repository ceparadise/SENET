In shared boundary across two separate component exchange information
The exchange device combination
Some computer hardware device send receive data interface others mouse microphone may provide interface send data given system
Hardware interface exist many component various device etc
A hardware interface described mechanical electrical logical signal interface protocol sequencing sometimes called signaling
A standard interface decouples design introduction computing hardware device design introduction component computing system thereby allowing user manufacturer great flexibility implementation computing system
Hardware interface several electrical connection carrying part data simultaneously data sent one time
A software interface may refer wide range different type interface different level operating system may interface piece hardware
running operating system may need interact via object within application may need interact via

Software interface provide access computer resource memory CPU storage etc
underlying computer system direct access
well designed interface resource software major disastrous functionality stability
Interfaces software component provide type specification
Sometimes public also defined part interface
The interface software module deliberately defined separately module
The latter contains actual code procedure method described interface well private variable procedure etc
Another software module example interacts forced published interface
One practical advantage arrangement replacing implementation another implementation interface cause internally meet requirement interface relevant specification interface

In language term often used define contains data code defines behavior signature
A code data method corresponding interface said interface
Furthermore class implement multiple interface hence different type time
An interface thus definition anywhere object exchanged example call object exchanged defined term interface rather specifying particular
This approach mean class implement interface used
For example may used allow development progress final implementation available
In another case implementation may substituted testing
Such implementation replaced real code later development process
Usually method defined interface contains code thus called must implemented code run invoked
An interface called might define two method
It implemented different way example first fast working stack fixed size second using data structure resized cost somewhat lower speed
Though interface contain many method may contain one even none
For example language defines interface single method various implementation used different purpose including
like contain method serve provide information generic processing using

In used control access common resource multiple system operating system
A trivial semaphore plain variable changed example incremented decremented toggled depending condition
The variable used condition control access system resource
A useful way think semaphore used system record many unit particular resource available coupled operation adjust record
avoid unit required become free necessary wait unit resource becomes available
Semaphores useful tool prevention race condition however use mean guarantee program free problem
Semaphores allow arbitrary resource count called semaphore restricted value called used implement
The semaphore concept invented found widespread use variety
It also used control mechanism controller example computer
Suppose library identical study room used one student time
Students must request room front desk wish use study room
If room free student wait desk someone relinquishes room
When student finished using room student must return desk indicate one room become free
In simplest implementation clerk front desk know number free room available know correctly student actually use room signed return done
When student request room clerk decrease number
When student release room clerk increase number
The room used long desired possible book room ahead time
In scenario front desk represents counting semaphore room resource student represent
The value semaphore scenario initially room empty
When student request room granted access value semaphore changed
After next student come drop
If someone request room resulting value semaphore would negative forced wait room freed count increased
If one room released several student waiting method used select one occupy room like FIFO flipping coin
And course student need inform clerk releasing room really leaving otherwise awkward situation student process leaving room packing textbook etc
another student enters room leave
When used control access resource semaphore track resource free keep track resource free
Some mechanism possibly involving semaphore may required select particular free resource
The paradigm especially powerful semaphore count may serve useful trigger number different action
The librarian may turn light study hall student remaining may place sign say room busy room occupied
The success protocol requires application follow correctly
Fairness safety likely compromised practically mean program may behave slowly act erratically even single process act incorrectly
This includes Even process follow rule may still occur different resource managed different semaphore process need use one resource time illustrated
Counting semaphore equipped two operation historically denoted P V see alternative name
Operation V semaphore operation P
The value semaphore number unit resource currently available
The P operation resource protected semaphore becomes available time resource immediately claimed
The V operation inverse make resource available process finished using
One important property semaphore value changed except using V P operation
A simple way understand P V operation Many operating system provide efficient semaphore primitive unblock waiting process semaphore incremented
This mean process waste time checking semaphore value unnecessarily
The counting semaphore concept extended ability claim return one unit semaphore technique implemented
The modified V P operation follows using square bracket indicate operation appear indivisible perspective process However remainder section refers semaphore unary V P operation unless otherwise specified
To avoid semaphore associated process usually semantics
If process performs P operation semaphore value zero process added semaphore queue execution suspended
When another process increment semaphore performing V operation process queue one removed queue resume execution
When process different priority queue may ordered priority highest priority process taken queue first
If implementation ensure atomicity increment decrement comparison operation risk increment decrement forgotten semaphore value becoming negative
Atomicity may achieved using machine instruction able semaphore single operation
In absence hardware instruction atomic operation may synthesized use
On system atomic operation ensured temporarily suspending disabling hardware
This approach work multiprocessor system possible two program sharing semaphore run different processor time
To solve problem multiprocessor system locking variable used control access semaphore
The locking variable manipulated using command
Consider variable boolean variable
accessed marked true
Thus semaphore
One imagine stoplight signal train station
In case signal green one enter train station
If yellow red color train station accessed
Consider system support ten user
Whenever user log P called decrementing semaphore
Whenever user log V called incrementing representing login slot become available
When user wishing log must wait login request enqueued onto FIFO queue used ensure request enqueued order
Whenever becomes greater login slot available login request dequeued user owning request allowed log
In one process producer generates data item another process consumer receives us
They communicate using queue maximum size subject following condition The semaphore solution problem track state queue two semaphore number empty place queue number element queue
To maintain integrity may lower never higher actual number empty place queue may lower never higher actual number item queue
Empty place item represent two kind resource empty box full box semaphore maintain control resource
The binary semaphore ensures integrity state queue compromised example two producer attempting add item empty queue simultaneously thereby corrupting internal state
Alternatively could used place binary semaphore
The initially initially initially
The producer following repeatedly The consumer following repeatedly Below substantive example Note may much lower actual number empty place queue example case many producer decremented waiting turn filling empty place
Note always hold equality producer consumer executing critical section
The canonical name V P come initial word
V generally explained increase
Several explanation offered P including test try pas grab
Dijkstra earliest paper subject give passing meaning release meaning It also mention terminology taken used railroad signal
Dijkstra subsequently wrote intended stand short literally try reduce parallel term used case try decrease
In English textbook operation called respectively
In software engineering practice often called standard library us
Some text call match original Dutch initial
A essentially thing binary semaphore sometimes us basic implementation
The difference used
While binary semaphore may used mutex mutex specific thread locked mutex supposed unlock
This constraint make possible implement additional feature mutexes

Let point I try extensively solve
The problem based circuit would appear processor jump
At best jump instruction propagate pipeline effect
There data path defined jump tell processor change PC
The thing change PC aside normal
I learning MIPS pipelining stage excruciatingly unclear jump instruction executed
On assignment question I asked trace pipeline command appear detail logic handled
The closest thing I find relevance opcodes different
The following table outline control code work four class opcodes explain happens jump subsequently machine know jump command
So I instruction get handled data path

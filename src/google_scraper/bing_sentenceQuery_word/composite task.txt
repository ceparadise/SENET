This may strictly computer science question related
Whenever function computes two element possible element computed
Or computing required limitation brain
For instance add three number add two third result first addition
Is possible brain take three number process intermediate step
Is possible machine
Is possible quantum computing
In case brain inability make computation trained compute certain way inherent limitation
Definitely possible computer since logic gate exist
Possible human least far conscious operation concerned
If show partition part
I recognize without intermediate calculation simply long experience playing bridge
Whenever function computes two element possible element computed
For instance add three number add two third result first addition
If question answer since addition associative
serial approach would one parallel approach could computed independently added together
If question answer since addition typically work least towards significant digit
Once least significant digit first two number added result carried least significant digit third number added result likewise carried
Different add number differently
For example accumulate carry instead applying digit digit
Or computing required limitation brain
Is possible brain take three number process intermediate step
Is possible machine
Is possible quantum computing
I sure question really relates adding number inherent property computation analogy computer human brain
I also sure mean intermediate step
Are
The brain indeed parallel processor
Unfortunately reached wrong forum question although I tell slapping quantum onto problem make solvable
See example Cognitive Sciences Stack Exchange
In case brain inability make computation trained compute certain way inherent limitation
We compute certain way part training
I know anyone ever practiced adding number parallel I imagine one approach would like trick multiplying I think partly matter definition sort process willing computation
Let suppose charged task compute given natural number n n th
It defined follows F n stand n th Fibonacci number F F F n F F n
We could actually define way programming language
For instance C This valid inefficient way compute Fibonacci number But define compute n th Fibonacci number
You tell
In C order evaluation argument undefined
One implementation may always evaluate left operand first right
Another may choose evaluation order depending weather
Yet another may evaluate parallel I believe valid
C program mostly run multiprocessing environment parallel implementation could actually implemented time
Let suppose use parallel implementation
It certainly way compute n th Fibonacci number
But computation
I sure
I think u computation stepwise process executed single processor strictly sequentially one step time
Not computation must done way case call process computation otherwise
Modern computer human brain quite work strictly sequentially
It conception computation abstraction really happens
We say computer human brain performs computation something equivalent abstraction even actually deviate
This part human brain find difficult come term inherently concurrent parallel computational process
We trained think computation strictly sequential process
If want meet different perspective computation familiarize dataflow processing
Unix pipe typical setup signal processing audio video processing
What system computation pretty mainstream way using computer adequately described Turing machine

One potential cause holistic face processing special kind perceptual cognitive processing reserved perceiving upright face
Previous study indeed found adult show stronger holistic processing looking adult face compared child face whether similar bias exists child remains shown
Here used composite face task standard test holistic face processing investigate child face holistic processing stronger child adult
Results showed child participant year larger composite effect adult participant year
Our finding suggests difference strength holistic processing may underlie bias recognition memory

Several study suggested face better recognised face phenomenon usually termed
As established better recognition memory relative face review see effect suggests sensitivity human visual system recognising individual face related way frequency type face encountered everyday environment
Exactly lie behind recognition memory bias however le understood
One plausible candidate special mechanism reserved perceiving upright face integrates information including spacing feature across entire face perceptual level
In effect literature demonstrated holistic processing indeed stronger face least Caucasian participant
Two recent study found bias holistic processing adult participant specifically adult special recent experience child holistic processing stronger adult face child face
In child however previous study failed find bias holistic processing despite demonstration bias recognition memory
It notable behind apparently conflicting result different experimental paradigm
The study found bias used Young et al composite face task whereas study found bias used Tanaka Farah task Tanaka Sengco task
Here aimed contribute question whether bias found child using composite face task comparing size composite effect child adult child face stimulus
It well established child show composite effect adult face also familiar child face knowledge previous test composite effect child unfamiliar child face comparison size composite effect child face familiar unfamiliar child adult
In present study child show stronger holistic processing face predict larger composite effect child relative adult
We measured strength composite illusion using standard procedure see version task used one study previously demonstrated bias holistic processing adult

Each original face divided horizontally eye
The composite face created joining top half one individual bottom half different individual

Misaligned face created offsetting top bottom half half face width
Half misaligned face offset left half right

Faces presented grey background
All manipulation done using Adobe Photoshop
The composite face paired either different pair always identical different pair always different
The bottom half pair always different
The result four kind composite pair SA SM DA DM
There different bottom half different top half
In SA condition top half used bottom half used twice two different bottom half required pair top half
The exact composite combination used SM condition
In DA condition top half shown bottom half shown twice two shown
The composite combination used DM condition
There composite face pair total comprising SA SM DA DM pair
The greater number pair intended increase proportion trial relevant final analysis procedure used previously composite score defined standard way namely accuracy difference SA SM trial
Only trial contribute measure composite effect holistic processing make clear prediction response difficult aligned misaligned trial make prediction direction alignment effect different trial direction depend similarity bottom half see result analysis different accuracy meaningless discussion see
Each participant tested using iMac computer open function room several activity occurring around
They seated distance approximately cm computer screen without chin rest
Participants instructed focus two sequentially presented pair face respond whether different via keyboard
It emphasized ignore bottom half face
The trial SA SM DA DM displayed random order
Each trial started presentation first face m followed blank screen m second face Each face appeared randomly one four different position screen left right left right eccentricity center screen
Following blank screen m question Were two different appeared response
The next trial followed Five practice trial given
The task designed measure accuracy
There instruction respond quickly indeed observed participant took time meaning analysis reaction time possible
We aim measure reaction time inappropriate measure reaction time accuracy set well ceiling b baseline reaction time inevitably vary substantially across age year affecting validity comparison size composite effect across age
Results shown also see
We analysed trial
The composite score calculated accuracy misaligned trial accuracy aligned trial
A Accuracy correct match trial full sample showing larger composite effect child adult
Error bar show SEM composite effect score appropriate comparison aligned misaligned
B The result hold subset participant baseline performance control misaligned condition matched across age group
C Scatterplot age versus composite score best linear fit adult showing decline holistic processing older adult
Considering result full sample statistical analysis showed greater variability composite score child adult Levene test equality variance
Thus comparing mean composite effect across group degree freedom adjusted appropriately using equation via equal variance assumed output SPSS
The composite effect significantly larger child adult indicating stronger holistic processing child adult looking child face
We conducted several analysis confirm result could attributed spurious confounds variable
First noted accuracy baseline misaligned condition higher adult child
Although indication difference affected proximity ceiling floor argued elsewhere much caution need used effect compared across age group presence baseline difference
Thus also analysed result created removing data child lowest adult highest score
Misaligned score two group successfully matched child mean composite score still larger adult Levene test equality variance
This analysis demonstrates finding stronger holistic processing face child due mismatched baseline performance two group
Second possible difference could attributed fact adult sample included wide range age
If reduction holistic processing aging say year age holistic processing child face continued reduce strength longer time since participant child comparison composite effect child adult group could affected
However provides scatterplot exact age composite effect score full sample show decline across adult age range
Statistical analysis confirmed within adult correlation age composite score
Third participant twin performance might totally independent one another assumed conducting
We therefore conducted ANOVA twin pair repeated measure factor age group factor
The main effect age group found significant confirming larger composite effect child adult
Finally turning theoretical interpretation necessary dispose one last potential limitation study
This unequal distribution gender across age
In child group participant female whereas adult group female
This raise possibility weaker holistic processing observed adult may something female
However literature suggests female better recognition memory face general
More relevant study female superior recognition ability extends child face sex difference also present child
Therefore anything prediction study would stronger holistic processing adult participant higher proportion female
Yet finding opposite child participant showed stronger holistic processing
Our result novel several way
First provide first demonstration child show composite effect unfamiliar child face
Second provide first comparison size composite effect child face across child adult participant thus provide first evidence composite effect larger former case
Finally provide first comparison composite effect across participant age age face avoids problem associated restriction range due ceiling effect adult see next section detail
We shown child larger composite effect adult child face
Our preferred interpretation arises bias holistic processing child participant thus complement earlier demonstration bias holistic processing adult participant
However given test adult face set alternative possible interpretation namely child might show larger composite effect adult face age
Previous data seem show first glance child stronger composite effect adult even tested adult face size composite effect de Heering et al child aged year adult Macchi Cassia et al slightly different way creating composite child aged year adult
In study however methodological issue prevents valid comparison size composite effect across age group
Specifically substantial difference overall performance age group adult participant performed close ceiling average child performance placed nicely middle range
This mean study provide compelling theoretically important evidence young child show strong composite effect claim stronger composite effect child adult could due simply problem adult
This interpretation directly supported two study adult participant taken laboratory de Heering et al study
These study used composite stimulus constructed way de Heering et al small vertical gap top bottom half set task difficulty avoid ceiling effect adult task average aligned misaligned performance
Under circumstance size composite effect adult comparable size found child de Heering et al
In addition evidence second reason think difference size composite effect child adult adult face
The composite effect measure holistic processing
The disproportionate inversion effect amount memory face exceeds memory object another measure holistic processing
For adult face Crookes McKone found disproportionate inversion effect size child adult
Also using adult face Crookes McKone Carey found size inversion effect face size child adult
Crucially study matched baseline performance across age group
These inversion result therefore make strong case holistic processing larger child adult adult face
Taking finding together believe probable interpretation present result represents bias child child face
We acknowledge however date study allow direct valid comparison size composite effect across child adult adult face thus remains possible although believe unlikely future study could demonstrate child show larger composite effect face type
Our composite effect result conflict two previous study tested child face find holistic processing stronger child adult
What origin conflict
We see two possibility
First may due presence baseline difference age group earlier study placed score sufficiently close ceiling adult floor child range show holistic processing effect tested might restricted one age group
In Pellicano Rhodes average two condition compared calculate holistic processing part whole nicely middle accuracy scale adult low enough perhaps produce problem child
Correspondingly child showed nonsignificant trend towards holistic processing adult reverse direction present study
In Pellicano et al opposite problem potential adult average across whole condition child average correspondingly child showed nonsignificant trend towards holistic processing adult direction present study
Thus failing equate baseline methodology may masked bias
The second possibility task matter versus composite effect present study
That composite effect widely accepted good measure holistic processing may poorly understood difference could produce genuine difference result child face two task
In absence study equated baseline performance across age group however would premature draw conclusion stage
Overall suggest result child complement previous paper adult make strong case holistic processing influenced effect influenced effect
This implies difference holistic processing different face type may important variable driving corresponding difference recognition memory well face
We next consider possible cause bias holistic processing
Presumably relates way amount recent visual experience participant different face type two recent study found preschool teacher showed stronger holistic processing child face ordinary adult
Another intriguing aspect study preschool teacher showed stronger holistic processing child face also showed weaker holistic processing adult face novice group
On speculative note seems indicate kind use holistic processing face
Perhaps holistic face processing capacity limited automatically deployed commonly encountered socially important face type
Our present data silent respect issue since test child participant adult face
This speculation predicts future study child visual experience social interest toward adult face would show stronger holistic processing adult face child face
Similarly child participant saw year old face school every day would greater recent experience child face adult participant unselected profession
It remains open question however whether relationship holistic processing experience direct indirect
There may direct effect tuning perceptual processing mechanism
By analogy dimension commonly argued tuned recent exposure match face diet one exposed explaining adaptation aftereffect face
Alternatively may direct causal effect experience holistic processing relationship may arise indirectly via correlation experience social categorisation social interest attention given difference face type
Face memory shown reduced social outgroup categorisation race field shown strength holistic processing altered merely changing perceived race group face stimulus morph
It may similar social effect contribute effect
In explaining previous finding adult may people choose become preschool teacher likely socially interested child spontaneously categorise social outgroup member
Similarly study child may well treated child face ingroup member adult
Indeed year old child differed strongly categorised year old face stimulus ingroup member could explain child group showed greater mean composite score also higher composite score adult group
Of course two proposal direct indirect influence necessarily mutually exclusive
It could bias holistic processing caused interaction amount quality recency visual experience face type tuning perceptual mechanism social categorization
Finally result theoretical implication topic quite different bias namely development special aspect face recognition across childhood
It widely agreed holistic processing qualitatively present young child standard phenomenon demonstrated year including composite inversion sensitivity spacing facial feature
There different recent view however whether holistic processing remains immature late childhood sense weaker child adult result many study suggest basis argued elsewhere finding increase holistic processing effect age unreliable due substantial baseline change across age group
Our present study join emerging literature arguing holistic processing fact quantitatively mature earlier rather later review see
In fact finding show possible child holistic processing adult

In confused way simple complex one
Compositions critical building block many basic data structure including well used programming
In programming language object typed type often divided composite noncomposite type composition regarded relationship type object composite type
object simpler type

Consider relation automobile part specifically composed object including
This relation might fixed computer program composition relation
However real world relation softer fuzzier
The engine one automobile may replaced engine another automobile meaning relation better described composition
Generally speaking time pass look like composition tend turn aggregation aggregation tend turn looser
Composition must distinguished process adding detail general data type create specific data type
For instance car may specific type vehicle
Subtyping describe relationship different object instead say object type simultaneously object another type
In programming language composite object usually expressed mean reference one object another depending language reference may known resulting composition
Fields given unique name one distinguished others
However reference necessarily mean object composite
It called composite object refers really part
independent existence
For detail see section
In two way modelling composition Composition aggregation
Beware UML composition narrow meaning ordinary language Composition depicted solid line
Composition kind association composite object sole responsibility disposition component part
The relationship composite component strong relationship composite object take ownership component
This mean composite responsible creation destruction component part
An object may part one composite
If composite object destroyed component part must destroyed
The part life transferred another object
Composition enforces encapsulation component part usually member composite object
The general form depicted solid line
Aggregation kind association specifies relationship aggregate whole component part
This relationship aggregate component weak relationship component may survive aggregate object
The component object may accessed object without going aggregate object
The aggregate object take part lifecycle component object meaning component object may outlive aggregate object
The state component object still form part aggregate object
The code show source code likely look like
This example composition
In example primitive type combined form composite structure
Each structure age name employment type
Objects composited recursively use
Consider tree
Each node tree may branch leaf word node tree time belongs another tree
One implementation recursive composition let object reference others type
In C example binary tree defined like If pointer valid node thought branch referring tree point
If node leaf
In way recursion terminated
Another use tagged union
For
see
call record structure language often keep record hidden inside instance language family simply call record
first widespread support record directly got COBOL got le indirectly ALGOL provides structure class latter via
Arrays composite data type
For example traditional linked list declaration Note ALGOL newtype name appears left equality notably construction made read left right without regard priority
Fortran array lacked formal definition
Typically compound structure built using statement Ada brought OOP concept tagged type equivalent class Ada added support verification contract
Arrays string inherited FORTRAN new reserved word introduced FORTRAN updated included concept called NAMELIST
Common Lisp provides structure ANSI Common Lisp standard added CLOS class
For detail composition see
Aggregation differs ordinary composition imply ownership
In composition owning object destroyed contained object
In aggregation necessarily true
For example owns various department department number professor
If university close department longer exist professor department continue exist
Therefore University seen composition department whereas department aggregation professor
In addition Professor could work one department department could part one university
Composition usually implemented object contains another object
For example In aggregation object may contain reference pointer object responsibility
Sometimes aggregation referred composition distinction ordinary composition aggregation unimportant
The code would transform following UML Class diagram In Microsoft aggregation mean object export owner one several another object owns
Formally similar aggregation
However instead implementing exported interface calling interface owned object interface owned object exported
The owned object responsible assuring method interface inherited actually invoke corresponding method owner
This guarantee reference count owner correct interface owner accessible exported interface private interface owned object accessible
Composition used store several instance composited data type referred containment
Examples container
In containment depicted multiplicity depending issue ownership indicating data type composed unknown number instance composited data type

In either following In programming language basic data type
In addition many language also provide set composite data type
Opinions vary whether type composite considered primitive
Depending language implementation primitive data type may may correspondence object computer memory
However one usually expects operation basic primitive data type fastest language construct
Integer addition example performed single machine instruction offer specific instruction process sequence character single instruction
In particular standard mention int object natural size suggested architecture execution environment
This mean likely bit long architecture
Basic primitive type almost always
Most language allow behavior capability primitive either basic data type modified program
Exceptions include permit data type extended within program adding operation performed even redefining operation
The actual range primitive data type available dependent upon specific programming language used
For example composite data type whereas modern dialect assimilated primitive data type basic
Classic basic primitive type may include More sophisticated type include An data type represents
Integers may either signed allowing negative value unsigned
Common range Literals integer written regular numeral consisting sequence digit negation indicated value
However programming language disallow use comma
Examples integer literal There several alternate method writing integer literal many programming language A type typically denoted bool boolean typically either true false
Although one bit necessary accommodate value set true false programming language typically implement boolean type one byte
Many language
implement booleans adhering concept distinct logical type
Languages though may implicitly convert booleans time give extended semantics booleans boolean expression achieve backwards compatibility earlier version language
For example former standard dedicated boolean type
Instead numeric value zero interpreted false value interpreted true
add distinct boolean type included support type true false reserved word
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally format equivalent typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
Many language often called float type
Literals floating point number include decimal point typically use denote scientific notation
Examples literal Some language also type comprising two number real part imaginary part
A number represents may fractional part
These number stored internally form typically sometimes
Because number limited precision subset number exactly representable number represented approximately
number also tend limited range value programmer must careful avoid overflow intermediate calculation well final result
A type typically called char may contain single specialized code
In defined smallest addressable unit memory
On system Several standard require size
Some language two character type example type character type character
The term character type normally used even type whose value precisely represent example code unit
Characters may combined
The string data include number numerical symbol treated text
Strings implemented various way depending programming language
The simplest way implement string create array character followed delimiting character used signal end string usually
These referred usually found language low amount
While easy implement null terminated string criticized causing
Most scripting language many dialect separate character type string length one normally used represent single character
Some language capability use string usually measure additionally provide class string handling respectively standard library
There also difference whether string mutable language
Mutable string may altered creation whereas immutable string maintain constant size content
In latter way alter string create new one
There advantage disadvantage approach although immutable string much le flexible simpler completely
Some example language use mutable string include whereas language include
A language provide different type mutable immutable string
Literals character string usually surrounded sometimes single quote used character double quote used string
Examples character literal C syntax Examples string literal C syntax Each numeric data type maximum minimum value known
Attempting store number outside range may lead error incorrect calculation due depending language used
The range variable based number byte used save value integer data type usually able store value number contribute value
For data type
value range complicated vary depending method used store
There also type use entire byte
boolean requires single represents value although practice byte often used remaining bit redundant
Some programming language also allow opposite direction programmer defines range precision needed solve given problem compiler chooses appropriate integer type automatically

The composite design pattern reduces cost implementation handle data represented tree
When application process tree usually process handle iteration component move tree process node leaf separately
All creates big amount code
Suppose handle file system repository
Each folder contain file folder
To handle array item file folder
The file name folder array
Now implement file search operation whole folder tree
The look like In previous code iteration loop process one node leaf
At end process code move position next node leaf process
There three branch loop
The first branch true processed child node move parent second go child node last process leaf
file
The memory location stored go back tree
The problem implementation hardly readable process folder file completely separate
This code heavy maintain think whole tree moment
The folder file called way object implement interface
So implementation rather like As see component individual object also collection object
A Composite pattern represent condition
In pattern one develop tree structure representing hierarchy
The best example use pattern Graphical User Interface
The widget interface organized tree operation resizing repainting widget processed using composite design pattern
This pattern one least expensive pattern
You implement time handle tree data without worrying
There bad usage pattern
The cost pattern handle child composite cost would required expensive without design pattern
You create almost empty interface implement management composite child
This cost low
You ca get caught system
The relatively expensive situation occurs often change operation applied whole data tree
You remove pattern remove data tree
So remove
This cost low
Various example composite pattern
The following example written translated directly Java example implement method named used either list whose element either list
The following example written implement graphic class either ellipse composition several graphic
Every graphic printed
In algebraic form It could extended implement several shape rectangle etc
method etc

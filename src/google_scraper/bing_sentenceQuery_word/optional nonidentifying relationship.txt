I able fully grasp difference
Can describe concept use real world example
An existence row child table depends row parent table
This may confusing common practice day create pseudokey child table make foreign key parent part child primary key
Formally right way make foreign key part child primary key
But logical relationship child exist without parent
Example A one phone number
If one phone number could simply store column
Since want support multiple phone number make second table whose primary key includes referencing table
We may think phone number belonging person even though modeled attribute separate table
This strong clue identifying relationship even literally include primary key
A primary key attribute parent become primary key attribute child
A good example lookup table foreign key referencing primary key
child table respect
But row identified attribute

part primary key
A relationship mean foreign key column allows NULL disallows NULL respectively
See also answer There another explanation real world A book belongs owner owner multiple book
But book exist also without owner ownership change one owner another
The relationship book owner relationship
A book however written author author could written multiple book
But book need written author exist without author
Therefore relationship book author identifying relationship
An Identifying relationship specifies child object exist without parent object relationship specifies regular association object n cardinality
relationship specified optional parent required mandatory parent required setting parent table cardinality
Here good description Relationships two entity may classified either identifying
Identifying relationship exist primary key parent entity included primary key child entity
On hand relationship exists primary key parent entity included child entity part child entity primary key
In addition relationship may classified either mandatory
A mandatory relationship exists value child table null
On hand relationship exists value child table null
Here simple example identifying relationship Here corresponding relationship A relationship mean child related parent identified
The relationship ACCOUNT PERSON
An identifying relationship mean parent needed give identity child
The child solely exists parent
This mean foreign key primary key
The relationship ITEM identifying
And LANGUAGE
correct among answer one point significant aspect
It said identifying relationship child exist without parent


This true completely miss point
It would enough enough foreign key achieve
It need part primary key
The purpose identifying relationship part primary key
identifying
second answer example book author relationship got vote ups
say A book however written author author could written multiple book
But book need written author exist without author
Therefore relationship book author identifying relationship
confusing example definitely
I finally understand difference relationship please confuse amount vote ups
yes book written without least one author author foreign key book book book table
remove author FK book row still identify book row field ISBN ID etc I think valid example would relationship product table specific product detail table example table considered FK reference table table identifying relationship FK printer table row inside child table ca remove child table ca identify row lost primary key want put line identifying relationship relationship FK child table considered PK identifier child table still reference parent table may table import product country import export country database table child field may use identify row import year column compose together primary key child table import also referencing parent table
please I happy I finally understand concept please tell I wrong vote ups yes logically book ca written without author book identified without author In fact ca identified author
please tell I misunderstood concept The identifing relaionship mean child entity totally depend existance parent entity
Example account table person table person account table identified existance account person table
The non identifing relationship mean child table identified existance parent table example table accounttype table identified existance account table
If consider child item deleted parent deleted identifying relationship
If child item kept even though parent deleted
As example I training database trainee training diploma training session Only training session deleted one related trainee training diploma deleted
A good example come order processing
An order customer typically Order Number identifies order data occurs per order order date Customer ID series line item
Each line item contains item number identifies line item within order product ordered quantity product price product amount line item could computed multiplying quantity price
The number identifies line item identifies context single order
The first line item every order item number
The complete identity line item item number together order number part
The parent child relationship order line item therefore identifying relationship
A closely related concept ER modeling go name subentity line item subentity order
Typically subentity mandatory identitying relationship entity subordinate
In classical database design primary key LineItems table would OrderNumber ItemNumber
Some today designer would give item separate ItemID serf primary key autoincremented DBMS
I recommend classical design case
Let say table relationship two table identifiying relationship
Because comment belong owner user
example
Each user comment user deleted user comment also deleted
Like well explained link identifying relation somewhat like weak entity type relation parent ER conceptual model
UML style CADs data modeling use ER symbol concept kind relation identifying
Identifying one relation child kind weak entity even traditional ER model called identifying relationship real primary key attribute therefore identified uniquely
Every access child table physical model dependent inclusive semantically parent primary key turn part total child primary key also foreign key generally resulting composite key child side
The eventual existing key child pseudo sufficient identify instance type Entity Entity Set without parent PK
relationship ordinary relation partial total completely independent entity set whose instance depend others primary key uniquely identified although might need foreign key partial total relationship primary key child
The child primary key
The parent idem
Both independently
Depending cardinality relationship PK one go FK N side partial null total must null
But relationship like FK never also PK child identifying relationship case
An identifying relationship two strong entity
A relationship may always relationship strong entity weak entity
There may exist situation child primary key existence entity may depend parent entity
For example relationship seller book book sold seller may exist seller may primary key entity created book sold Reference based Bill Karwin Thank interest question

There three type variable scientific experiment define later lesson
First let discus scientist use experiment
An experiment used determine association different variable looking cause effect relationship
A cause effect relationship mean alter one variable measure observe another variable keeping everything else effect variable measure observe
This type experiment important cause effect relationship variable outcome predictable used advantage may manipulated changed
More important little later lesson
Now let talk three type variable used scientific experiment
The first variable type called
This variable one manipulated changed scientist
The second type variable one observed measured experiment known
You remember observation measure dependent variable change independent variable altered
Let use example may assist understand two type variable
You plastic container water inside
You place container metal box raise temperature
Here temperature independent variable adjusting temperature changing independent variable
The water dependent variable
If cause effect relationship water temperature water change temperature change
And course know water change liquid gas steam rising temperature box
But third type variable used scientific experiment
It also known
As name suggests variable scientist want remain
Often one control constant variable scientific experiment
The scientist want observe control variable much dependent variable
But important
The reason control variable held constant scientist know independent variable caused change dependent variable change due control variable
In example would control variable
The answer air pressure
The condition must exist able predict change water certain temperature
At atmosphere water boil turn steam lower temperature level normal air condition
Get FREE access day create account
Below line graph show data point would shown dependent independent variable study
Notice control variable represented line graph
The represents dependent variable independent variable
In example dependent variable water would plotted independent variable temperature would plotted
Remember point experiment cause effect relationship found scientific study outcome manipulated changed
In example experiment learning water turn steam certain temperature useful
Once hold air pressure constant sea level know need steam need adjust manipulate temperature degree Fahrenheit
This course simple example illustrate point cause effect relationship manipulate changing dependent variable like temperature
Let review
In science item factor condition controlled changed
There three main type variable scientific experiment controlled manipulated hope affected change independent variable must held constant ensure know manipulation independent variable causing change dependent variable
Using variable correctly help scientist measure cause effect scientific experiment allows scientist manipulate cause effect produce desired outcome

An describes thing interest specific domain knowledge
An ER model composed entity type classify thing interest specifies relationship exist instance entity type
In ER model commonly formed represent thing business need remember order perform business process
Consequently ER model becomes abstract defines data information structure implemented typically
modeling developed database design published paper
However variant idea existed previously
Some ER modeler show super subtype entity connected relationship ER model used also specification
An model usually result systematic analysis define describe important process area business
It define business process present business data schema graphical form
It usually drawn graphical form box connected line express association dependency entity
An ER model also expressed verbal form example Entities may characterized relationship also additional property include identifier called primary key
Diagrams created represent attribute well entity relationship may called diagram rather model
An ER model typically implemented
In simple relational database implementation row table represents one instance entity type field table represents attribute type
In relationship entity implemented storing primary key one entity pointer foreign key table another entity There tradition model built two three level abstraction
Note hierarchy used kind specification different
The first stage design us model describe information need type stored
The technique used describe
overview classification used term relationship certain
In case design information system based database later stage usually called logical design mapped turn mapped physical model physical design
Note sometimes phase referred physical design
An may defined thing capable independent existence uniquely identified
An entity abstraction complexity domain
When speak entity normally speak aspect real world distinguished aspect real world
An entity thing exists either physically logically
An entity may physical object house car exist physically event house sale car service concept customer transaction order exist concept
Although term entity one commonly used following Chen really distinguish entity
An category
An entity strictly speaking instance given
There usually many instance
Because term somewhat cumbersome people tend use term entity synonym term
Entities thought
Examples computer employee song mathematical theorem
A relationship capture entity related one another
Relationships thought linking two noun
Examples relationship company computer relationship employee department relationship artist song relationship mathematician conjecture
The model linguistic aspect described utilized database ERROL mimic construct
ERROL implementation based RRA relational algebra adapted model capture linguistic aspect
Entities relationship attribute
Examples entity might SSN attribute relationship may attribute
Every entity unless must minimal set uniquely identifying attribute called entity
diagram show single entity single instance relation
Rather show entity set entity entity type relationship set relationship relationship type
Example particular entity
The collection song database entity set
The relationship child lunch single relationship
The set relationship database relationship set
In word relationship set corresponds relationship corresponds member relation
Certain relationship set may indicated well
Chen proposed following rule thumb mapping natural language description ER diagram Peter Chen
Physical view show data actually stored
In Chen original paper give example relationship role
He describes relationship marriage two role husband wife
A person play role husband marriage relationship another person play role wife marriage
These word noun
That surprise naming thing requires noun
Chen terminology also applied earlier idea
The line arrow diagram owes earlier Chen relationship diagram
Another common extension Chen model name relationship role verb phrase
It also become prevalent name role phrase
Correct noun case
Thus rather etc
The use noun direct benefit generating physical implementation semantic model
When two relationship possible generate name immediately meaningful
Modifications original specification beneficial
Chen described
As aside notation used Oracle Designer us minimum cardinality analogous optionality role maximum cardinality crow foot
In Elmasri Navathe others preference role minimum maximum cardinality
Recent researcher Feinerer Dullea et al
shown coherent applied relationship order greater
In Dullea et al
one read A across notation used UML effectively represent semantics participation constraint imposed relationship degree higher binary
In Feinerer say Problems arise operate semantics used UML association
Hartmann investigates situation show different transformation fail
also As see next page interpretation introduces several difficulty prevent extension simple mechanism binary association
Chen notation modeling us rectangle represent entity set diamond represent relationship appropriate attribute relationship
If entity set participates relationship set connected line
Attributes drawn oval connected line exactly one entity relationship set
Cardinality constraint expressed follows Attributes often omitted clutter diagram diagram technique often list entity attribute within rectangle drawn entity set
Related diagramming convention technique Crow foot notation beginning date back article Gordon Everest used SSADM
Crow foot diagram represent entity box relationship line box
Different shape end line represent cardinality relationship
Crow foot notation used consultancy practice
Many consultant CACI including Richard Barker subsequently moved UK developed early version Oracle tool introducing notation wider audience
With notation relationship attribute
Where necessary relationship promoted entity right example necessary capture artist performed song new entity performance introduced attribute reflecting time place relationship artist song becomes indirect relationship via performance
In using modeled database user encounter two well known issue returned result mean something result assumed query author
The first trap
It occurs master table linking multiple table relationship
The issue derives name way model look draw diagram linked table master table
This type model look similar type model used
When trying calculate sum aggregate using standard SQL master table get unexpected incorrect result explanation missing
The solution either adjust model SQL
This issue occurs mostly database decision support system software query system sometimes includes specific method handling issue
The second issue trap
A chasm trap occurs model suggests existence relationship entity type pathway exist certain entity occurrence
For example Building Rooms hold Computers
You would expect able query model see Computers Building
However Computers currently assigned Room repair somewhere else shown list
You need another relation Building Computers capture computer building
This last modelling issue result failure capture relationship exist real world model
See detail
A semantic model model concept sometimes called platform independent model
It intensional model
At latest since well known An extensional model one map element particular methodology technology thus platform specific model
The UML specification explicitly state association class model extensional fact considering extensive array additional adornment provided specification provided prior candidate semantic modelling language
Peter Chen father ER modeling said seminal paper In original article Chen explicitly contrast diagram record modelling technique Several author also support Chen program Chen accord philosophic theoretical tradition time Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates Plato Aristotle BC modern
associate knowledge apprehension unchanging Forms The form according Socrates roughly speaking archetype abstract representation many type thing property relationship one another

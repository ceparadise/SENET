Students completed program LMC able Our assessment research began looking thestudents application knowledge general computer hardware software concept description configuration operation personal computer
However looking data important issue became mode course delivery online
student COMSC student COMSC proficiency
But importantly student assessed half semester completely online section COMSC demonstrating extremely low retention rate
Only assessed semester length course COMSC
Also many student took COMSC fulfill college Computer Literacy requirement rather considering program computer networking consequently dropped class
When State course descriptor COMSC published course redesigned hybrid completely lab
All student consider whether online course well suited learning style strength

The Major Field Test Computer Science consists question grouped set based material diagram graph program fragment

The Department Computer Science Michigan Tech introductory course sequence CS Introduction Programming taken first semester CS Introduction Programming taken second semester
The course taught Java assume prior experience writing computer program
If programming knowledge experience Java Python etc
might find introductory course easy
We accelerated introductory course might better fit
CS cover material two course introductory sequence cover one semester rather two
We developed CS Knowledge Assessment
This series question designed help u place course best fit unique combination experience knowledge
The assessment supported online course used refresh knowledge computer science time passed since last programming experience
Engineering transfer student may also take assessment

UC Santa Cruz HIV Vaccine Research Computer science study theoretical practical aspect computer technology computer usage
The Computer Science Department offer two undergraduate degree
computer science
computer science
It also offer following graduate degree
computer science computer science
Besides offering instructional course department engages substantial research program advanced undergraduate graduate student participate
The bachelor art
degree computer science UCSC designed give student solid grounding theoretical practical topic computer science computer engineering mathematics leaving flexibility broad program study including many course outside science engineering even double major another discipline
The bachelor science
degree computer science appropriate student desiring somewhat stronger concentration science course computer science computer engineering well course physic chemistry degree also allows elective outside science engineering
Students graduate program develop skill specialized area research include analysis algorithm artificial intelligence pattern recognition retrieval machine learning neural network computer game computer graphic computer animation scientific visualization computer sensor vision image processing image synthesis multimodal interaction programming language environment software engineering Web Internet engineering embedded system computer security database parallel distributed computation operating system storage system
The Master Science
degree Computer Science UCSC build student core knowledge graduate course algorithm programming language architecture

student choose two type
degree project track thesis track
Their progress measured completion coursework requirement passing report presentation Masters
The doctor philosophy degree Computer Science UCSC build student core knowledge graduate course algorithm programming language architecture
PhD student proceed study research selected area specialization
Their progress PhD study measured preliminary exam qualifying exam dissertation defense
Recipients BS BA Computer Science degree UCSC expected following skill experience Table show curriculum alignment course common BS BA degree
Table show curriculum alignment course unique BS BA degree respectively
CMPS Technology Targeted Social Issues P The assessment plan BS BA degree primarily based direct evidence student competency relevant course
See Table
While course grade relevant course may provide sufficient resolution particular PLO upper division course usually involve project account significant portion course grade
Taken group course grade provide reasonable assessment PLO
While one may argue rubric evaluation form designed measure particular PLO always feasible due different nature class make difficult rubric used across multiple course
Furthermore course standardized evaluation form CMPS cover multiple PLOs
These included Appendix I Performance Review form II Capstone Sponsor form
The performance review form used ass individual student class capstone sponsor form used ass group project standardized meet ABET requirement

Each student must take pas core course including algorithm programming language architecture test mastery fundamental knowledge ability use analytical computational method PLO
MS student also required complete Master Project MS project track Masters Thesis MS thesis track
The project thesis track test mastery material least one area focus PLO
Students MS project required complete report topic read reviewed review committee award Master Science degree PLO PLO
Students MS thesis track required propose thesis topic end first year complete thesis read reviewed review committee give pas public presentation completed research review committee award Master Science degree PLO PLO
See Tables
Inefficient inelegant solution Recipients PhD Computer Science degree UCSC expected following characteristic experience PhD student expected complete unit coursework least unit must CS

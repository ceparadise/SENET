In used way store manipulate knowledge interpret information useful way
They often used application research
Normally term system applied system involving curated rule set
system constructed using automatic rule inference normally excluded system type
A classic example system us rule make deduction choice
For example expert system might help doctor choose correct diagnosis based cluster symptom select tactical move play game
system used perform interpret computer program
attempt derive execution instruction starting set data rule
This indirect method employed list execution step sequentially
A typical system four basic component

When using digital computer rule based
Even architecture neural network far concerned system
A trained neural network digital computer exhibit set rule even know rule
However general people use rule programmed explicitly rule derived algorithm data
But end result digital computer always hidden rule

January Takes high level view knowledge look different type knowledge mapping executable computer code gain insight rule engine provide advantage conventional software development tool
printed page The word like many word adapted computer science technical meaning different common like many word defined many time suit need various trend computer science
This paper take high level view knowledge using word general sense rather specific technical term look different type knowledge mapping executable computer code
The purpose gain insight rule engine provide advantage conventional software development tool
The three type knowledge considered
These division correspond capability computer
The first two map naturally computer architecture third
Factual knowledge fact data
It fact customer order product speed light
Computers memory external storage device
These ideally suited storage retrieval factual knowledge
Database tool programming language manipulate memory evolved naturally basic component machine architecture
Factual knowledge appears computer either element database variable constant computer program shown
Procedural knowledge knowledge perform task
It process order search Web calculate Fourier transform
Computers central processing unit CPU process instruction one time
This make computer storing executing procedure
Programming language make easy encode execute procedural knowledge evolved naturally basic computational component
Procedural knowledge appears computer sequence statement programming language shown
Logical knowledge knowledge relationship entity
It relate price market consideration product component symptom diagnosis relationship various task
Unlike factual procedural knowledge core architectural component computer well suited storage use logical knowledge
Typically many independent chunk logical knowledge complex store database lack implied order execution make programming
Because map well underlying computer architecture shown logical knowledge difficult encode maintain using conventional database programming tool evolved computer architecture
Specialized tool effectively virtual machine better suited logical knowledge often used instead conventional tool shown
Rule engine logic engine two example
Logical knowledge often core business automation often associated module application
Consider example pricing module phone call airline seat order configuration module
Furthermore logical knowledge often changing
Government regulation expressed logical knowledge effect changing market condition
Business rule drive organization almost always expressed logical knowledge
Because critical role logical knowledge play good argument using specialized tool make encoding logical knowledge quicker easier reliable
There also however good argument foremost ready pool talent familiar conventional tool
There lot said sticking familiar although general cost lengthy development time tedious maintenance cycle higher normal error rate often compromise quality service application provides
On hand well known problem rule engine tool designed working logical knowledge Given difficulty payoff using tool worth investment
In many case yes
For example one organization provides online mortgage service replaced line procedural code price mortgage line logical rule
The solution implemented two month opposed year invested original module
Maintenance turn around due changing market condition reduced week hour error resulting code went practically zero
One reason near zero error simply le code go wrong main reason code closely reflects logical knowledge expressed
There tricky translation business specification procedural code
The biggest win might flexibility solution provided allowing expand product offering
They could offer better mortgage pricing option customer including option customizing pricing logic institutional customer
This uncommon story
The benefit improvement ratio appear success story vendor logic technology
The concept gap used explain many issue logical knowledge
A semantic gap refers difference way knowledge encoded application naturally specified syntax computer language tool used encoding
For example use assembler code scientific equation
But tedious large semantic gap syntax assembler equation
The FORTRAN scientific programming language invented reduce semantic gap
It allowed programmer code equation way much closer way scientist might write equation paper
The result easier quicker coding engineering scientific application fewer error
Factual knowledge procedural knowledge readily coded computer reasonably small semantic gap way fact procedure described tool encoding
As pointed previously computer inherently good fact procedure
The semantics logical knowledge however map readily conventional tool
Consider piece knowledge The meaning semantics knowledge best captured sense
It really mean detail proposed trip matched condition rule appropriate rule used determine fare
This sort knowledge could shoehorned procedural code semantics procedural code designed express sequence operation search
On hand rule engine designed interpret rule sense rule entered tool smaller semantic gap rule encoded procedurally
It tempting store logical relationship procedural code especially since procedural code statement
In fact tempting work reasonably well point
However big difference logical relationship procedural
A procedural really branching statement controlling flow execution procedure
If condition true control go one way control go different way
It fork road
It road bit cause trouble
A logical relationship coded procedural must placed somewhere along road execution procedure
Furthermore logical relationship must placed point procedural necessity placement one affect behaviour another
It make difference rule get placed first branch previous rule branch following rule placed
This problem rule map easily decision tree case knowledge really procedural
It also problem small number rule number rule increase becomes difficult maintain fork procedural flow
The arbitrarily imposed thread execution link various rule becomes extremely tangled making code difficult write first place difficult maintain
This say ca done indeed done often
However module rule often troublesome module system
Once encoded procedurally logical knowledge longer easily accessible longer look like collection rule declarative relationship
The knowledge resource sense lost buried code scientific equation longer read coded assembler
The true either factual procedural knowledge
In case reading code generally show underlying knowledge
It possible case shoehorn logical relationship database
If relationship represented tabular form database table used encode rule
So example amount discount customer got dependent amount previous sale different level could represented table stored database
However using procedure database approach limited work clean sort logical relationship
Sometimes application use mixture procedural database approach
Logical relationship expressed table stored database remaining relationship coded procedural statement
This simplify coding task make maintenance harder logical knowledge spread across two different vehicle
Despite difficulty strong appeal using data procedure encode logical knowledge familiar technique numerous individual skilled use
The problem encoding logical relationship first explored back researcher Stanford University
They trying build system advised physician course antibiotic treating bacterial infection blood meningitis
They found medical knowledge consists mainly logical relationship expressed rule
They attempted many time encode knowledge using conventional tool failed problem described previously
If problem coding logical knowledge nature computer expressing logical relationship clearly answer create machine
Building specialised hardware practical turn computer good tool creating virtual computer
This researcher Stanford
They effectively created virtual machine programmed using logical rule
This type virtual machine often called rule engine
Why computer good building rule engine rule
It behaviour rule engine expressed procedural algorithm along line The Stanford researcher working first system originally called work programming course fancy way saying programming
Because large amount human thought seems involve dynamic applying rule stored brain idea surfaced somehow intelligence
However real reason growth term pure simple easier get Department Defence funding advanced research Artificial Intelligence AI heuristic programming
The term system also invented time reason
The medium excited idea Artificial Intelligence expert system software industry went cycle tremendous hype AI followed disillusionment technology simply could live hype
Those company survived continue market sell technology found term AI detriment looked different term
Now often called programming
Whether call heuristic programming Artificial Intelligence expert system business rule processing underlying technology virtual engine us search find apply right logical knowledge right time
Virtual engine programmed declarative rule example specialized software designed deal logical knowledge
Other program dramatically altered course history computing
In early day data processing report database coded using COBOL
But reporting requirement specified logical column partial sum etc
Culprit report writer let user specify declarative logical way knowledge report
It would generate procedural code make report happen
The benefit exactly could create maintain report without go programmer
The result quicker report faster turn around new report reporting met user need much better procedural approach channelled programming group
The resistance technology also exactly
Data processing department want use separate tool report knew COBOL
The product became commercial success marketed data processing department
Culprit first commercial software product company launching software industry
The VisiCalc spreadsheet program another example
It let user easily describe logical relationship cell without write procedural code
As language report writer key virtual engine translated logical knowledge executable procedural code
Spreadsheet application drove early acceptance personal computer
Recent work Stanford explored question AI widely spread medicine observation apply application software general
Logical knowledge express relationship entity unless entity available computation logic automated
One write system help deal patient aspect health care without underlying patient data reason logic base limited value
The true application area
Without database product component ca build configuration system without raw data phone call date time duration ca implement pricing module
The lack underlying data reflects delay adaptation new technology
It recently example higher percentage doctor office using patient record
Likewise recent year data becoming available relational database lend multiple application us rather file used history computing
Early AI success story related application dynamically gather data user diagnostic system work organization good computerized record insurance phone company
As data becomes readily accessible use application deploying logical knowledge
Tools encoding deploying logical knowledge relatively straightforward
The two critical part
Knowledge representation syntax particular tool
Each tool allows entering logical knowledge certain format might simple statement referencing simple entity complex statement reference complex object property
They English like syntax closely resemble formal logic
The classic design tradeoff versus expressive power apply
A tool might provide mean expressing logical knowledge well hierarchical structure might include capability expressing uncertainty
Uncertainty useful type application like diagnosis clear right answer get way something like pricing one right answer
Uncertainty come competing Bayesian original factor
The reasoning engine determines rule applied runtime
All reasoning engine basically search engine looping rule deciding use next repeating process end condition reached
However major difference pattern searched happens rule used
The two basic strategy
A goal driven reasoning engine look rule provides answer goal price
Having found one look might necessary customer status
A data driven reasoning engine look current known data pick rule something data
It fire rule add otherwise change known data
For example customer might want configure custom door first bit data match rule add data hinge needed lead rule decides type hinge
Within two basic scheme many variation one might encounter
A diagnostic reasoning engine might strategy let follow likely path solution first least expensive requirement user research information
A critical aspect reasoning engine API called application component
This let logic base integrated application context manner let logic base updated without requiring update main application code
One biggest problem maintaining logic base consistency definition
If writing technical support system example one rule refers another XP well wo communicate unless somehow system XP type Windows operating system
This unfortunately difficult part maintaining logic base
While easy write add rule unless rule author us terminology rule work cohesive unit
A solution naming problem ontology
Just term ontology perfectly normal word appropriated use computer science
The dictionary definition ontology little computer science use word
Not surprisingly term ontology coined people decided heuristic better word rule
A logic base ontology collection definition relationship entity used component application
An ontology would information XP type Windows
And Windows type operating system
An ontology would also know Windows synonym
Given ontology rule entered refer XP refering operating system
For example rule might condition system operating system rule fire value system XP
An ontology provides alternate way represent logical knowledge relating terminology powerful adjunct common rule
Given wide variety way rule engine represent knowledge reason knowledge integrate surrounding environment sometimes difficult choose right one
A general purpose rule engine fit wide range problem might fit well requiring stuffing bending around corner
For reason find rule engine product designed specific application
Microsoft Server perfect example
It tool designed integrating business process
It business process passing message used express rule process fire condition process needed informed happens
There also product pricing problem support problem configuration problem number common area
Each work better problem domain designed wo much help problem area
There another option consider well creation custom solution particular application
Rule engine difficult write building one particular application allows best possible knowledge representation reasoning strategy integration main component application
The key advantage relates back semantic gap
A custom knowledge representation language provide smallest possible semantic gap application associated benefit ease development ease maintenance
In order better understand advantage solution consider following case study
A number company use logic engine specialized tool encoding logical knowledge workflow
Typically tool integrate larger facility application rule governing workflow
For example one large supplier workflow telecommunication industry integrated rule describing workflow facility larger application context rule directly applied task telecommunication domain
This allows separation business logic defining work flow rule procedural knowledge actual process need performed put work flow knowledge representation easily understood maintained
A vendor window door us logic base rule drive interactive product configuration Visual interface
Contractors use Visual Basic program determine best configuration job site automatically connect company server entering order
They customized development using Excel allowing expert directly maintain logical knowledge product configuration using familiar tool
The spreadsheet translated rule language used deploy knowledge
Because logic base separate entity main application code easily updated
Whenever user working Visual Basic program connects server update configuration logic base automatically downloaded
The result flexible responsive architecture providing customer contractor powerful tool deciding ordering best product particular job
A sophisticated application determines geologic site good mining potential
The rule match geologic characteristic mining potential logic base maintained separately Visual Basic interface graphically display geologic map information potential site
Key application ontology definition mining terminology allows geologic field data easily accessed rule
Without ontology would difficult rule make use field data entered different geologist different way expressing geologic concept
The ontology stored maintained part logic base
The application currently Visual Basic application deployed Web using Visual Basic
Visual Data LLC provides software product called paediatrician office
It keep medical record patient performs function might expect
One item track patient vaccination history
It turn one problem paediatrician following complex rule regulation vaccination scheduling child future appointment based vaccination need
Customers asked Visual Data provide feature Office Practicum would tell vaccination child visit due
It also able provide report child analyzing vaccination history making sure compliance regulation school summer camp
This took Visual Data realm encoding logical knowledge
The knowledge vaccination published paper made available CDC
Each vaccine one schedule dos based particular type vaccine numerous exception rule describe condition vaccination may may given
There number interesting observation made application
The first relates Stanford comment AI medicine AI advanced due lack data
They observed AI really encoding logical relationship without entity logical knowledge reason practical value automating logic
The vaccination program illustrates
People past worked AI system automate vaccination logic patient data vaccination history readily available
It typed hand input system order get vaccination schedule
However medical practitioner experienced vaccination could figure schedule directly data time without engage computer process
So much point
Office Practicum provides enough help business running paediatrician office collecting data patient history come naturally
Because data computer office already using computer aspect managing patient make sense automate logical knowledge vaccination scheduling
In fact customer started ask feature using software
They noted vaccination information computer could automatically generate vaccination schedule
Visual Data first attacked problem attempting encode vaccination logic using procedural code
In case application developed Borland Delphi used Pascal encoding
The software worked difficult write large complex module provided feature wanted provide
However world vaccine kept changing
New vaccine coming combined earlier vaccine single vaccination new complex rule interaction component
Customers wanted know software would support Pediatrix new complex multi disease vaccine
The software developer groaned
While Delphi shop familiar Delphi would love work Delphi realized vaccination module difficult maintain opted logic base solution
The logic base reduced code size thousand line code hundred line easily understandable rule
It ratio seen many time application
Further rule format resident paediatrician programmer could understand
The application restructured Delphi code called logic base much way called database
The vaccination scheduling completely outside core Delphi code
The logic base updated without affecting main application database updated without changing application
Unlike database logic base must tested Office Practicum us tool set independently test rule
Regression test part system various scenario automatically retested change made logic base
Visual Data use rule engine couple reason
One cost important logical knowledge vaccine seemed require specific set way represent knowledge
These included definition table rule
While three could stored rule visual clarity mapping documentation logic base would lost
It would better logic base directly expressed CDC logic
Further logical knowledge date date interval expressed date month week year
The condition rule needed use interval date correctly assume age context appropriate
Accordingly knowledge representation language vaccination system designed This made easy add new definition without affecting rule allowed direct encoding basic table enabled rule refer table reason concept last live virus vaccination
The ontology describes semantic relationship various type vaccine Hib vaccine well distinguishing contain
This critical different schedule used
It also describes vaccine live virus vaccine another critical fact used many rule concerned interaction different vaccine contain live virus
Additionally product combined measles mumps rubella MMR vaccine
There rule concerned example whether child measles vaccine database might indicate MMR
This knowledge ontology well
Here example definition logic base indicate Varicella Small Pox live virus vaccination Here different type Hib
Standard table provide minimum age recommended age minimum spacing interval dose vaccine
If vaccination logic database solution table lookup would worked although even table simple
For given vaccine different table apply depending factor whether active component whether child followed standard schedule
Here example table logic base describes Hib schedule vaccine containing
The rule work concert definition table
They used determine table appropriate given situation
They also provide coverage exception case fact given vaccine necessary certain age schedule ca kept live virus vaccine given corrective measure previous vaccine given earlier allowed
Here relatively simple rule fire Polio sequence complete
Note ontology let rule refer either general two main vaccine separately
This rule describes OPV sequence complete
The output includes explanatory note displayed verbose mode
Modularization key requirement application
The table rule vaccine kept separate module
The ontology hand common module used module
The reasoning engine vaccine logic base designed meet variety application need
It take input vaccination history child go module vaccine question get status information vaccine
This includes analysis past vaccination vaccine status today current office visit recommended range minimum date next vaccination vaccine
Each module designed goal output goal called reasoning engine
This allows easy addition different vaccine easy maintenance particular vaccine
The reasoning engine application program interface API used calling application
The API provides various report required different us
For example tell vaccine need given day office visit vaccine needed scheduling visit
It also allows short verbose reporting explanation recommendation provides historical analysis reporting required camp school form
The benefit logic base approach All benefit add one major benefit software provides better service customer area critically important running paediatric office
The cost Logical knowledge unlike factual procedural knowledge difficult encode computer
Yet ability organization successfully encode logical knowledge lead better service user
The question best encode logical knowledge
It tool encoding difficult knowledge becomes opaque maintenance becomes nightmare
tool better suited encoding logical knowledge require selection proper tool knowledge encoded learning use tool
rule logic tool sometimes provide good solution often knowledge representation tool fit actual knowledge reasoning engine use knowledge supposed used
This lead coding maintenance problem experienced conventional tool lesser extent depending big semantic gap knowledge tool
A viable alternative building custom language reasoning engine
This allows closest fit coding knowledge actual knowledge cleanest integration tool rest application context

My intuition based many year best model collection
A rule like partial function describes handle particular action
Many rule might cover action different condition
For example examine command print You see nothing special general case print description Elvish sword command object sword content ancient book object book learned book language complain instead light case say It dark see
All stricture formulated rule various condition outcome
The traditional way handle IF model object examine method run
But need extended condition distinguished command object
There environmental property darkness property player known language property entire world time day
You force back structure sort code harness check method object room player
That Inform work
But still degree
I found designing game rule collection porting design
So I suggested structure rule
This sound great lot unresolved problem
Rules frequently conflict
Then need decide rule follow
In example nothing special rule must others dark rule must others
You often make obvious choice rule take precedence game author able make final decision
Does I know language rule dark
What book luminescent language Braille
Games vary
I bounced problem around several month I failed come complete satisfactory solution
However condition handled uniformly universally across language
action activity phrase support slightly different model condition outcome
There structure hardwired rule etc I think ought handled rule different rule system
And mechanism rule least awkward inflexible
This condemnation
I rule model powerful enough
So I position propose replacement
But I continued think problem
In spring I wrote presentation give case rule model detail nifty slide
In May I took part online chat William Byrd Doug Orleans discussed problem possible solution
You
pointed paper
Thanks
The stuff I talking particularly property idea look lot like model computer science called
As These logical rule incontrovertible logical rule
In word rule exception
I also asked around book logic programming Prolog classical language language
I started dig yet I post list
Also includes reference natural language Prolog interesting IF completely separate reason

sometimes referred abbreviation confused investigates use software text speech one another
On basic level MT performs simple substitution word one language word another alone usually produce good translation text recognition whole phrase closest counterpart target language needed
Solving problem statistical technique rapidly growing field leading better translation handling difference translation isolation anomaly
Current machine translation software often allows customization domain improving output limiting scope allowable substitution
This technique particularly effective domain formal formulaic language used
It follows machine translation government legal document readily produce usable output conversation le standardised text
Improved output quality also achieved human intervention example system able translate accurately user word text proper name
With assistance technique MT proven useful tool assist human translator limited number case even produce output used weather report
The progress potential machine translation debated much history
Since number scholar questioned possibility achieving fully automatic machine translation high quality
Some critic claim obstacle automating translation process
The idea machine translation may traced back century
In proposed universal language equivalent idea different tongue sharing one symbol
The field machine translation appeared
The first researcher field Yehosha began research MIT
A MT research team followed public demonstration system
MT research program popped Japan Russia first MT conference held London
Researchers continued join field Association Machine Translation Computational Linguistics formed National Academy Sciences formed Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee ALPAC study MT
Real progress much slower however found research failed fulfill expectation funding greatly reduced
According report Director Defense Research Engineering DDR E feasibility MT reestablished success Logos MT system translating military manual Vietnamese conflict
The French Textile Institute also used MT translate abstract French English German Spanish Brigham Young University started project translate Mormon text automated translation Xerox used SYSTRAN translate technical manual
Beginning late power increased became le expensive interest shown
Various MT company launched including Trados first develop market translation memory technology
The first commercial MT system Russian English developed Kharkov State University
MT web started SYSTRAN Offering free translation small text followed AltaVista Babelfish racked request day
Och future head Translation Development AT Google DARPA speed MT competition
More innovation time included MOSES statistical MT engine translation service mobile Japan mobile phone translation functionality English Japanese Chinese
Recently Google announced translates roughly enough text fill million book one day
The idea using digital computer translation natural language proposed early possibly others
wrote important memorandum
The Georgetown experiment mean first application demonstration made machine rudimentary translation English French
Several paper topic published time even article popular journal see example Cleave Zacharov
A similar application also pioneered Birkbeck College time reading composing text computer
The human may described Behind ostensibly simple procedure lie complex operation
To decode meaning entirety translator must interpret analyse feature text process requires knowledge source language well culture speaker
The translator need knowledge meaning target language
Therein lie challenge machine translation program computer understand text person create new text target language sound written person
In general application beyond current technology
Though work much faster automated translation program procedure human participation produce output even close quality human translator produce
What however provide general though imperfect approximation original text getting gist process called gisting
This sufficient many purpose including making best use finite expensive time human translator reserved case total accuracy indispensable
This problem may approached number way evolution accuracy improved
Machine translation use method based mean word translated linguistic way suitable orally speaking word target language replace one source language
It often argued success machine translation requires problem solved first
Generally method parse text usually creating intermediary symbolic representation text target language generated
According nature intermediary representation approach described
These method require extensive information large set rule
Given enough data machine translation program often work well enough one language get approximate meaning written native speaker
The difficulty getting enough data right kind support particular method
For example large multilingual data needed statistical method work necessary method
But grammar method need skilled linguist carefully design grammar use
To translate closely related language technique referred may used
The machine translation paradigm includes machine translation interlingual machine translation machine translation paradigm
This type translation used mostly creation grammar program
Unlike method RBMT involves information linguistics source target language using morphological syntactic rule semantic analysis language
The basic approach involves linking structure input sentence structure output sentence using parser analyzer source language generator target language transfer lexicon actual translation
RBMT biggest downfall everything must made explicit orthographical variation erroneous input must made part source language analyser order cope lexical selection rule must written instance ambiguity
Adapting new domain hard core grammar across domain adjustment limited lexical selection adjustment
machine translation similar creates translation intermediate representation simulates meaning original sentence
Unlike interlingual MT depends partially language pair involved translation
Interlingual machine translation one instance approach
In approach source language
text translated transformed interlingual language
language neutral representation independent language
The target language generated
One major advantage system interlingua becomes valuable number target language turned increase
However interlingual machine translation system made operational commercial level KANT system Nyberg Mitamura designed translate Caterpillar Technical English CTE language
Machine translation use method based entry mean word translated dictionary
Statistical machine translation try generate translation using based bilingual text corpus corpus record Canadian parliament record
Where corpus available good result achieved translating similar text corpus still rare many language pair
The first statistical machine translation software
Google used several year switched statistical translation method October
In Google improved internal translation capability using approximately billion word United Nations material train system translation accuracy improved
Google Translate similar statistical translation program work detecting pattern hundred million document previously translated human making intelligent guess based finding
Generally document available given language likely translation good quality
Newer approach Statistical Machine translation METIS II PRESEMT use minimal corpus size instead focus derivation syntactic structure pattern recognition
With development may allow statistical machine translation operate monolingual text corpus
SMT biggest downfall includes dependent upon huge amount parallel text problem language especially translating language inability correct singleton error
machine translation EBMT approach proposed
machine translation based idea analogy
In approach corpus used one contains text already translated
Given sentence translated sentence corpus selected contain similar component
The similar sentence used translate component original sentence target language phrase put together form complete translation
Hybrid machine translation HMT leverage strength statistical translation methodology
Several MT organization formerly LinguaSys claim hybrid approach us rule statistic
The approach differ number way More recently advent Neural MT new version hybrid machine translation emerging combine benefit rule statistical neural machine translation
The approach allows benefitting rule guided workflow well benefitting NMT SMT
The downside inherent complexity make approach suitable specific use case
One proponent approach complex use case
A based approach MT made rapid progress recent year Google announced translation service using technology preference previous statistical method
Other provider including KantanMT announced deployment neural machine translation technology well
disambiguation concern finding suitable translation word one meaning
The problem first raised
He pointed without universal encyclopedia machine would never able distinguish two meaning word
Today numerous approach designed overcome problem
They approximately divided shallow approach deep approach
Shallow approach assume knowledge text
They simply apply statistical method word surrounding ambiguous word
Deep approach presume comprehensive knowledge word
So far shallow approach successful
translator United Nations wrote machine translation best automates easier part translator job harder part usually involves extensive research resolve exigency require resolved The ideal deep approach would require translation software research necessary kind disambiguation would require higher degree yet attained
A shallow approach simply guessed sense ambiguous English phrase Piron mention based perhaps kind camp often mentioned given corpus would reasonable chance guessing wrong fairly often
A shallow approach involves ask user ambiguity would Piron estimate automate professional translator job leaving harder still done human
One major pitfall MT inability translate language accuracy standard language
Heuristic statistical based MT take input various source standard form language
translation nature include common usage
This cause error translation vernacular source colloquial language
Limitations translation casual speech present issue use machine translation mobile device
Name entity narrow sense refer concrete abstract entity real world including people organization company place etc
It also refers expressing time space quantity July
Named entity occur text analyzed statistical machine translation
The initial difficulty arises dealing named entity simply identifying text
Consider list name common particular language illustrate common name different language also constantly changing
If named entity recognized machine translator may erroneously translated common noun would likely affect rating translation would change text human readability
It also possible identified named entity omitted output translation would also implication text readability message
Another way deal named entity use instead translation meaning find letter target language closely correspond name source language
There attempt incorporate machine translation adding transliteration step translation procedure
However attempt still problem even cited worsening quality translation
Named entity still identified incorrectly word transliterated transliterated
For example Southern California first word translated directly second word transliterated
However machine would often transliterate treated one entity
Words like hard machine translator even transliteration component process
The lack attention issue named entity translation recognized potentially stemming lack resource devote task addition complexity creating good system named entity translation
One approach named entity translation transliterate translate word
A second create list end goal transliteration opposed translation
Both approach still rely correct identification named entity however
A third approach successful named entity translation model
In method named entity replaced token represent class belong
For example Ted Erica would replaced person class token
In way statistical distribution use person name general analyzed instead looking distribution Ted Erica individually
A problem class based model solves probability given name specific language affect assigned probability translation
A study Stanford improving area translation give example different probability assigned David going walk Ankit going walk English target language due different number occurrence name training data
A frustrating outcome study Stanford attempt improve named recognition translation many time decrease score translation result inclusion method named entity translation
Some work done utilization multiparallel body text translated language
Using method text translated language may utilized combination provide accurate translation third language compared one source language used alone
An formal representation knowledge includes concept object process etc
domain relation
If stored information linguistic nature one speak lexicon
In ontology used source knowledge machine translation system
With access large knowledge base system enabled resolve many especially lexical ambiguity
In following classic example human able interpret according context use world knowledge stored lexicon I saw
A machine translation system initially would able differentiate meaning syntax change
With large enough ontology source knowledge however possible interpretation ambiguous word specific context reduced
Other area usage ontology within NLP include
The ontology generated PANGLOSS machine translation system may serve example ontology purpose compiled While system provides holy grail fully automatic machine translation unrestricted text many fully automated system produce reasonable output
The quality machine translation substantially improved domain restricted controlled
Despite inherent limitation MT program used around world
Probably largest institutional user
The project example coordinated received million euro project support EU create reliable translation tool cover majority EU language
The development MT system come time budget cut human translation may increase EU dependency reliable MT program
The European Commission contributed million euro via ISA programme creation MT EC statistical machine translation program tailored administrative need EU replace previous machine translation system
claimed promising result obtained using proprietary statistical machine translation engine
The statistical translation engine used Arabic English Chinese English overall score IBM score Summer test conducted National Institute Standards Technology
With recent focus terrorism military source United States investing significant amount money natural language engineering

In Ishida Matsubara lab Kyoto University method improving accuracy machine translation support tool collaboration today globalized society studied
The application technology medical setting human translator absent another topic research however difficulty arise due importance accurate translation medical diagnosis
There many factor affect machine translation system evaluated
These factor include intended use translation nature machine translation software nature translation process
Different program may work well different purpose
For example SMT typically outperforms EBMT researcher found evaluating English French translation EBMT performs better
The concept applies technical document easily translated SMT formal language
In certain application however product description written system produced satisfactory translation require human intervention save quality inspection
There various mean evaluating output quality machine translation system
The oldest use human judge ass translation quality
Even though human evaluation still reliable method compare different system statistical system
mean evaluation include
Relying exclusively unedited machine translation ignores fact communication take person comprehend context original text reasonable degree probability
It certainly true even purely translation prone error
Therefore ensure translation useful human translation achieved translation must reviewed edited human
The late wrote machine translation best automates easier part translator job harder part usually involves extensive research resolve exigency target language require resolved
Such research necessary prelude necessary order provide input software output
In addition disambiguation problem decreased accuracy occur due varying level training data machine translating program
Both statistical machine translation rely vast array real example sentence base translation many sentence analyzed accuracy jeopardized
Researchers found program trained sentence pairing accuracy actually decrease
The optimal level training data seems sentence possibly training data increase number possible sentence increase making harder find exact translation match
Although concern machine translation accuracy Ana Nino University Manchester researched advantage utilizing machine translation classroom
One pedagogical method called using MT Bad Model
MT Bad Model force language learner identify inconsistency incorrect aspect translation turn individual hopefully posse better grasp language
Nino cite teaching tool implemented late
At end various semester Nino able obtain survey result student used MT Bad Model well model
Overwhelmingly student felt observed improved comprehension lexical retrieval increased confidence target language
In early option machine translation spoken signed language severely limited
It common belief deaf individual could use traditional translator
However stress intonation pitch timing conveyed much differently spoken language compared signed language
Therefore deaf individual may misinterpret become confused meaning written text based spoken language
Researchers Zhao et al
developed prototype called TEAM translation English ASL machine completed English ASL translation
The program would first analyze syntactic grammatical morphological aspect English text
Following step program accessed sign synthesizer acted dictionary ASL
This synthesizer housed process one must follow complete ASL sign well meaning sign
Once entire text analyzed sign necessary complete translation located synthesizer computer generated human appeared would use ASL sign English text user
Only subject protection scholar claim machine translation result entitled copyright protection MT involve
The copyright issue author original language lose work translated translator must permission translation

It becoming le common see paper documentation
Documentation distributed via website software product application
Professionals educated field termed documentalists
This field changed name us term documentation still exists effort reintroduce term documentation field study
While associated standard easily available publicly guide source topic may serve purpose

David Berger provided several principle document writing regarding term used procedure numbering even length sentence etc
The following list guide dealing specific field type The procedure documentation vary one sector one type another
In general may involve document drafting formatting submitting reviewing approving distributing reposting tracking convened associated regulatory industry
It could also involve creating content scratch
Documentation easy read understand
If long wordy may misunderstood ignored
Clear Short Familiar word used maximum word sentence
Only gender hyper neutral word used cultural bias avoided
Procedures numbered performed

Technical writer corporate communicator professional whose field work documentation
Ideally technical writer background subject matter also writing managing content information architecture
Technical writer commonly collaborate subject matter expert SMEs engineer technical expert medical professional type client define create content documentation meet user need
Corporate communication includes type written documentation required company
The following typical software documentation type The following typical hardware service documentation type Documentation include feasibility report technical documentation operational documentation log book etc
There many type software application used create documentation
SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER SDF A common type software document written software engineer simulation industry SDF
When developing software simulator range embedded avionics device terrain database way full motion control system engineer keep notebook detailing development build project module

This build document enables future developer maintainer come speed software timely manner also provides roadmap modifying code searching bug
SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK INVENTORY AND CONFIGURATION These software tool automatically collect data network equipment
The data could inventory configuration information
The request create database basis information IT responsible
It also basis IT documentation
Examples include XIA Configuration
Documentation preferred term process populating criminal database
Examples include TIDE gang database

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
Documentation Final available

written text illustration accompanies embedded source code
It either explains operates use may mean different thing people different role
important part
Types documentation include documentation description particular shall
It used throughout communicate software function intended operate
It also used agreement foundation agreement software
Requirements produced consumed everyone involved production software name
Thus requirement documentation many different purpose
Requirements come variety style notation formality
Requirements close design anything
They specified statement drawn figure detailed combination
The variation complexity requirement documentation make proven challenge
Requirements may implicit hard uncover
It difficult know exactly much kind documentation needed much left architecture design documentation difficult know document requirement considering variety people shall read use documentation
Thus requirement documentation often incomplete
Without proper requirement documentation software change become difficult therefore error prone decreased expensive
The need requirement documentation typically related complexity product impact product software
If software complex developed many people mobile phone software requirement help better communicate achieve
If software negative impact human life nuclear power system medical equipment mechanical equipment formal requirement documentation often required
If software expected live month two small mobile phone application developed specifically certain campaign little requirement documentation may needed
If software first release later built upon requirement documentation helpful managing change software verifying nothing broken software modified
Traditionally requirement specified requirement document
using word processing application spreadsheet application
To manage increased complexity changing nature requirement documentation software documentation general system tool advocated
Architecture documentation also known special breed design document
In way architecture document third derivative code second derivative code document first
Very little architecture document specific code
These document describe program particular routine even particular routine exists form instead merely lay general requirement would motivate existence routine
A good architecture document short detail thick explanation
It may suggest approach lower level design leave actual exploration trade study document
Another breed design doc comparison document trade study
This would often take form
It focus one specific aspect system suggests alternate approach
It could code design even architectural level
It outline situation describe one alternative enumerate pro con
A good trade study document heavy research express idea clearly without relying heavily obtuse dazzle reader importantly impartial
It honestly clearly explain cost whatever solution offer best
The objective trade study devise best solution rather push particular point view
It perfectly acceptable state conclusion conclude none alternative sufficiently better baseline warrant change
It approached scientific endeavor marketing technique
A important part design document enterprise software development Database Design Document DDD
It contains Conceptual Logical Physical Design Elements
The DDD includes formal information people interact database need
The purpose preparing create common source used player within scene
The potential user When talking Systems document include following part It important include information used actor scene
It also important update document change occurs database well
It important code document associated source code may include file documentation thorough verbose becomes overly difficult maintain
Various overview documentation guide commonly found specific software application software product documented
This documentation may used developer tester also using software application
Today lot application field power energy transportation network aerospace safety security industry automation variety domain seen
Technical documentation become important within organization basic advanced level information may change period time architecture change
Code document often organized style allowing programmer quickly look arbitrary function class
Often Universal Report used code extract comment available source code create reference manual form text file
The idea documentation attractive programmer various reason
For example extracted source code example programmer write referring code use tool used create source code make documentation
This make much easier keep documentation
Of course downside programmer edit kind documentation depends refresh output example running update document nightly
Some would characterize pro rather con
Respected computer scientist noted documentation difficult afterthought process advocated written time location extracted automatic mean
The programming language support simple form literate programming support widely used
Elucidative Programming result practical application Literate Programming real programming context
The Elucidative paradigm proposes source code documentation stored separately
Often software developer need able create access information going part source file
Such usually part several software development activity code walk porting third party source code analysed functional way
Annotations therefore help developer stage software development formal documentation system would hinder progress
Unlike code document user document simply describe program used
In case code document user document could case effectively equivalent worth conjoining general application often true
Typically user documentation describes feature program assist user realizing feature
A good user document also go far provide thorough assistance
It important user document confusing date
User document need organized particular way important thorough
Consistency simplicity also valuable
User documentation considered constitute contract specifying software
well accomplished towards writing good user document would well aware software architecture programming technique used

User documentation produced variety online print format
However three broad way user documentation organized
A common complaint among user regarding software documentation one three approach taken two
It common limit provided software documentation give reference information command menu item
The job tutoring new user helping experienced user get program left private publisher often given significant assistance software developer
Like form technical documentation good user documentation benefit organized process development
In case user documentation process commonly occurs industry consists five step basic research phase process
actual documentation phase
phase feedback sought draft composed previous step
whereby usability document tested empirically
final step information collected step three four used produce final draft
The resistance documentation among developer well known need emphasis
This situation particularly prevalent methodology try avoid unnecessary activity directly bring value
Specifically advocate valuing working software comprehensive documentation could interpreted cynically We want spend time coding
Remember real programmer write documentation
A survey among software engineering expert revealed however documentation mean considered unnecessary agile development
Yet acknowledged motivational problem development documentation method tailored agile development
may needed
For many application necessary promotional material encourage casual observer spend time learning product
This form documentation three purpose

In computer hardware software product development documentation information describes product user
It consists product technical manual online information including online version technical manual help facility description

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck
Required field marked Kathrynne Skonicki Director Media Relations Office Marketing Communications

Find pick best Computer Science Program Menu Embedded system computerized system within larger device control increase functionality device
The concept embedded system new clearest example seen observing human body numerous subsystem like optical auditory nervous system
In early day computing age idea embedded system commonly associated military weapon system intelligence gathering equipment
Today advance nanotechnology resulted proliferation system used throughout modern society
Entertainment gadget like smart phone player well safety device like smoke carbon monoxide detector example item contain least one embedded system
There inherent challenge embedded system developer face standard application programmer working modern information technology IT project
Here example issue relating embedded system development embedded system engineer prepare career specialty computing field employment outlook computing specialist
engineering encompasses hardware software design development product software often associated system performance
The primary challenge embedded software development software must fit embedded hardware design
This often result limited memory storage capacity processing speed
Although limited hardware design embedded system performance critical control life saving device like used public safety personnel medical community
Conducting functional integration testing system also difficult performing evaluation standard application multiple electrical mechanical component involved
While standard application developer often computer science background embedded system engineer undergraduate degree electrical engineering applied mathematics physic computer engineering
These engineer must able quickly adapt work various hardware platform development environment
However good deal embedded application written C developer taken extensive course relate specific programming language undergraduate graduate school year
While continuing education always requirement success within IT job professional certification embedded system engineering prolific IT role
Also hiring manager engineering position place emphasis demonstrated knowledge skill certification
The academic credential seem prefer advanced degree electrical engineering computer engineering
Embedded system engineer want pursue professional development opportunity also participate specialized graduate level certificate course subject many university
The skill needed become embedded system engineer across many different industry result numerous employment opportunity qualified
Surveys conducted Bureau Labor Statistics BLS projected job career category would continue grow system developer would find greatest number opportunity industry like defense consumer electronics communication
In BLS reported like construct embedded system earned annual mean wage
It become popular computerize various item increase operational efficiency within business reduce defect within industrial production facility improve quality life consumer
Continued innovation demand improvement current product contain embedded system help ensure progression specialty computing field

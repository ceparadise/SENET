The term derived Greek word meaning meaning
The two main type biometric identifier depend either physiological characteristic behavioral characteristic
Physiological identifier relate composition user authenticated include finger geometry size position finger vein recognition DNA matching
Behavioral identifier include unique way individual act including recognition typing pattern walking gait gesture
Some behavioral identifier used provide continuous instead single authentication check
Authentication becoming increasingly common corporate public security system consumer electronics application
In addition security driving force behind biometric verification convenience remember carry
Some biometric method measuring person gait operate direct contact person authenticated
Components biometric device include Biometric data may held centralized database although modern biometric implementation often depend instead gathering biometric data locally cryptographically authentication identification accomplished without direct access biometric data
Biometric identifier depend uniqueness factor considered
For example fingerprint generally considered highly unique person
Fingerprint recognition especially implemented Apple iPhone first widely used mass market application biometric authentication factor
Other biometric factor including retina iris vein voice facial scan adopted widely far part le confidence uniqueness identifier factor easier spoof
Stability biometric factor also important acceptance factor
Fingerprints change lifetime facial appearance change drastically age illness factor
The greatest privacy issue using biometrics physical attribute like fingerprint retinal blood vessel pattern generally static modified
This distinction nonbiometric factor like password something know token something replaced breached otherwise compromised including million individual whose fingerprint compromised data breach
The increasing ubiquity camera microphone fingerprint reader many today mobile device mean biometrics continue become common method authenticating user particularly specified new standard authentication biometrics support biometric factor
While quality biometric reader continues improve still produce false negative authorized user recognized authenticated unauthorized user recognized authenticated
While camera sensor help enable use biometrics also enable attacker
Because people shield face ear hand voice gait attack possible simply capturing biometric data people without consent knowledge
An early attack fingerprint biometric authentication called date back Japanese researcher using confection showed attacker lift latent fingerprint glossy surface capacitance gelatin similar human finger fingerprint scanner designed detect capacitance would fooled gelatin transfer
Other biometrics factor also defeated determined attacker
In Jan Krissler also known Starbug Chaos Computer Club biometrics researcher demonstrated method extracting enough data photograph defeat iris scanning authentication Krissler reported defeating iris scanner authentication scheme used Samsung Galaxy smartphone
Krissler previously recreated user thumbprint image demonstrate Apple Touch ID fingerprinting authentication scheme also vulnerable
After Apple released iPhone X took researcher two week bypass Apple Face ID facial recognition using mask Face ID also defeated individual related authenticated user including child sibling

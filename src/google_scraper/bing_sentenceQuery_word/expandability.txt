Alfred Thompson blog teaching computer science level
Alfred high school computer science teacher year
He also taught grade computer specialist
Projects exercise lend many different correct solution best sort learning experience I imagine
They really open possibility discussion discussion question answer explanation come real learning
Recently student Old Dominion University Microsoft Student Partner told FizzBizz exercise
see come This exactly sort multiple solution difficult sort exercise I love
Briefly stated exercise Write program print number
But multiple three print Fizz instead number multiple five print Buzz
For number multiple three five print FizzBuzz
So
It involves using sort conditional course
Nested unnested
It done either way
Which way best
Do check multiple three first five
Do check see number one case first one case
Or rather If statement different way completely
Perhaps structure
Does creating complicate simplify result
If student know multiple programming language one better another think especially functional language procedural language
Are special operator like perhaps ternary operator C Java might make code tighter Is trade complication understanding
Oh course solution actually work
Justify answer
Don love I see asking student write explanation solution work way mean forcing examination solution
And side benefit lot student benefit yet another writing exercise
Code explained properly understood cause problem long run
A piece code magic person wrote
There many solution Internet FizzBuzz question
So yes student might go searching one even try use
The question mean still understand explain work like
I see student saying Well I hope try
But grade well explain benefit using borrowed code credited original source properly
And course also able explain solution better others might found
Surely lazy hand first solution found
BTW couple related post mine Here question I taken challenge past
Here link version I also done C one codepad
Curse supporting
So approach I take
I actually approached maximum readability standpoint
As I use cringes expected hardcore programmer booleans
And though I check specifically way I created code make work perfectly
In short would Print fizz multiple buzz multiple number neither applies
Noting true fizz buzz get printed
I tend avoid ternary
They make character count smaller true readability usually suffers
They offer absolutely compiler benefit
I think cover question presented herein
And I concede many right answer best subjective
Mine best course
Haha
One note
You might want check kid problem tickle fancy
Actually site good sort thing Supports C Visual Basic F
Keith mod FizzBuzz elseif mod Buzz elseif mod Fizz else N two number mutually prime number factor product factor
anon mod definitely way math guy first thing I thought
I approach
Unfortunately switch unavoidable
Full explanation
Posted soon
Here better version
Done java via JSP I primarily work web development
Fewest line code I could figure solve problem
I added new line character readability
int String output output Fizz output Buzz br else br Dim As Integer Dim oWrite As oWrite C While If Mod And Mod Then CStr FizzBuzz ElseIf Mod Then CStr Fizz ElseIf Mod Then CStr Buzz Else CStr End If End While This based drinking game called drank get correct number group counted
I lost lot
But congrats one posted code already
If work I set web service return string print given integer input
duh
I jaded
FizzBuzz must hot topic reason I saw day ago site
Over year I seen many plausible response actually help learn thing language The one I seen least time SQL I developed version
I get reminded SQL chooses first match case statement ignores rest first check
I also know I could use string concatenation build look graceful
DECLARE Count INT SET Count DECLARE FzBz VARCHAR WHILE Count BEGIN SELECT FzBz CASE WHEN Count THEN WHEN Count THEN WHEN Count THEN ELSE CAST Count AS VARCHAR END PRINT FzBz SET Count Count END I love ternary scripted language I feel readability suffers syntax unique one know looking ever encountered
I still think could probably condensed feeling back neck I missing something almost certainly would impact readability
I also note I used n integer sample mostly practical application would need made pretty newline character two le code character br
My apology repost
I tried submit acknowledgement page loaded comment listed
C Code int string

FizzBuzz Fizz
Buzz C iam dumb reduced one line int string

FizzBuzz Fizz
Buzz C Code Man iam dumbest c programmer around int

FizzBuzz Fizz
Buzz Explanation code Since come check first
If work check
If FizzBuzz else Fizz
If work check work Buzz else return number string
All one line
Both AND OR condition handled one line
Should go wrong guess may dumb
Aditya ancient god readability curse Modulo obviously first thought using Sieve Eratosthenes approach
Pseudocode three bit five bit three true five true three five three print Fizz five print Buzz else print Benefit No division necessary
Division much expensive CPU addition
So depending context program needed algorithm may much appropriate
It sacrifice space complexity sake time complexity
If really could optimize replacing occurrence letting loop start end earlier would need print number
But would require commenting code
anon You said two number mutually prime number factor product factor
I know
Yet elegance code I check
I save check simply endl till check done
Imports Public Class BizzBuzz Const As Integer Const As Integer Private Sub ByVal sender As ByVal e As Handles Dim nums As New Dictionary Of Integer String Dim output As New StringBuilder Dim line As New StringBuilder bizz buzz For x To For Each key As Integer In If x Mod key Then nums key End If Next If Then x End If vbNewLine line Next End Sub End Class This quick dirty configurable outside code lends upgraded future configured work different number different string
Ideally would read database xml file least user would option entering number string used
It improvement solution presented requires le modification client change specification multiple replaced respectively multiple replaces respectively
Hi Alfred I consider interesting problem mathematics necessary investigate maybe resolve
A faster solution use Mod modulo operator
Should proceed
Thank int num num num FizzBuzz else Fizz else num Buzz else num Solutions use modulus would interesting
As would discussion faster
In fact lot discussion option faster otherwise better encouraged
That way useful presenting solution
No mod
Or Division
OK
Faster
Sure
By le human would ever notice
solution C without using Mod FWIW using System using using using namespace FIzzBuzz class Program static void Main string args var output

Fizz
Buzz foreach var output I could write language I know since I person nature I
For As Integer To If Mod Then Fizz ElseIf Mod Then FizzBuzz Else End If Loop Not quite David
Some case clearly missing
David anyone else may need example Your output first number look like Fizz Buzz Fizz Fizz Buzz Fizz FizzBuzz After Fizz Buzz pattern repeat different number
A simple list answer far easiest write verify read If application would approach I would accept
Would fastest solution meet brief take single line Print Fizz Buzz Fizz Fizz Buzz Fizz FizzBuzz etc The print statement method fast
It reliable typist though highly prone error
And matter scale
How easy modify routine handle number
Or use arbitrary starting ending point
Good coder think expandability maintainability
Some language including C allow write unreadable code understood compiler writer
If I saw something like job yes production code string

FizzBuzz Fizz
Buzz I would reject code review
Yes quick teaching student professional job
Will person able maintain six month
Will someone else understand
How long take someone else understand
In business time money
If programmer need take extra time understand type code assuming whole program written like business wasting valuable time money
Something like String output output Fizz output Buzz br else br As teacher preparing student professional life software engineer important instill idea code readability important

A good question
The proper answer probably specify Integers
I would say go without saying unless specified otherwise given requirement integer expected result also specified integer
The ability understand natural language import good programmer
If reason confusion requirement state measure object foot foot length store database would cause confusion partial measurement one would ask question order understand requirement fully
I unfortunate experience working contractor took approach pointing inane triviality language infinite number number X Y I hire back
Such people unproductive excel creating rabbit hole falling
That say someone legitimately confused requirement I would answer clarification question people confused
They simply unfortunate habit trying look important highly educated something
I never quite sure
But come across difficult work best
Jerks worst
It probably go without saying I gave question interview candidate said infinite number number I would hire
That would immediate disqualifier
If hand said integer
I confirm integer would think le
Ability see missing specification important quality

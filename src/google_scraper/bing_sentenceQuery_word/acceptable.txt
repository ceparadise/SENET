Latency delay input system desired outcome term understood slightly differently various context latency issue also vary one system another
Latency greatly affect usable enjoyable electronic mechanical device well communication
Latency communication demonstrated live transmission various point earth communication ground transmitter satellite satellite receiver take time
People connecting distance live event seen wait response
This latency wait time introduced signal travelling geographical distance well various piece communication equipment
Even limited speed light refractive index cable repeater amplifier along length introduce delay
expression much time take data get one designated point another
In environment example AT T latency measured sending returned sender time considered latency
Ideally latency close zero possible
The contributor network latency include special case network latency Internet large network
The factor determine latency Internet
However distance transmission medium number hop equipment server greater smaller network
Internet latency measurement would generally start exit network end return requested data Internet resource
length time take computer act signal telling stop decide response event
important factor determining Internet latency
A WAN busy directing traffic produce delay whether resource requested server another computer network elsewhere Internet
LAN user also experience delay WAN busy
In either example delay would still exist even rest hop including server desired data located entirely free traffic congestion
delay sound created heard
In sound created physical world delay determined varies slightly depending medium travel
Sound travel faster denser medium It travel faster solid le quickly liquid slowest air
We generally refer speed sound measured dry air room temperature
In electronics audio latency cumulative delay audio input audio output
How long delay depends hardware even software used operating system driver used computer audio
Latencies generally noticed individual separate production arrival sound ear
See video demonstration measure audio latency iOS device defined sum time operation performed linear
In parallel workflow latency determined slowest operation performed single task worker
delay input mechanical system device desired output
This delay determined Newtonian limit mechanism excepting mechanic
An example would delay time shift gear time shift lever gear box bicycle shifter actuated
combined delay input command desired output
In computer system latency often used mean delay waiting increase real perceived beyond desired
Specific contributor computer latency include mismatch data speed microprocessor device inadequate data performance hardware involved well driver
The processing load computer also add significant latency
From user perspective latency issue usually perceived lag action response
In simulation example using helmet provides stereoscopic vision head tracking latency time computer detection head motion time display motion image
In multiplayer networked Internet gaming low latency critical best gameplay enjoyability
Control difficult significant latency player lagging behind event game due delay information getting computer
Latency issue noticeable individual generally increasing user annoyance impacting level increase
The severity effect varies one application another mitigating tactic
However game often enjoyable around latency
In communication delay result heavy traffic hardware problem incorrect set configuration
Latency testing vary application application
In application measuring latency requires special complex equipment knowledge special computer command program case latency measured stop watch
In networking estimated latency equipment server determined running ping command information latency hop gathered trace route command
camera might used capture minute difference response time input various mechanical electronic system
Reducing latency function tuning tweaking upgrading computer hardware software mechanical system
Within computer latency removed hidden technique prefetching anticipating need data input request using parallelism across multiple execution thread
Other step reduce latency increase performance include uninstalling unnecessary program optimizing networking software configuration upgrading hardware

In case instructor define constitutes acceptable collaboration course
What required collaboration one course may considered serious misconduct another
These guideline form default suitable majority course based individual evaluation opposed team evaluation
In event imperative every instructor vocal clear guideline course whether guideline formulated specifically course
If guideline made clear may difficult distinguish honest mistake intentional misconduct
A clear case plagiarism exists student pass someone else work
Examples behavior include limited following These case indisputable plagiarism characterized submission work performed another one name
Collaboration research constitute plagiarism generally encouraged
These effort constitute honest attempt obtaining deeper understanding problem hand
They also serve validation student approach problem
Some example follows Provided plagiarism committed valid encouraged activity
The difference example plagiarism encouraged collaboration originality acknowledgment
In general work submitted without acknowledgment original work indicated author constitutes plagiarism
Some example illustrate point follow
It noted example constitute academic misconduct may questionable academic value
It also noted anyone knowingly negligence contributing someone else academic misconduct also guilty

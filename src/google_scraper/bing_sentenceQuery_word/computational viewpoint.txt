Since time computer become indispensable appliance business essential facet science
From statistical analysis mutation HIV simulation describing evolution universe flow traffic freeway information extracted meaningful way large database transfer money ATM card used computer sophisticated algorithm large network database central life science essential
In science problem become complicated datasets larger technique needed design experiment make sense requires computer algorithm development necessary system simulation analysis
The activity enables accomplishment using computer research tool field computational science
It clearly involves mathematics applied mathematics computer science statistic along understanding science application
This activity involves original thought discovery ability design use tool system facility communicating field
The term broad one describes scientific engineering inquiry computer play essential role
It involves development model system algorithm simulation order solve concrete problem
For instance NSF Program Description Computational Mathematics program support mathematical research area science computing play central essential role emphasizing algorithm numerical method symbolic method
The prominence computation research hallmark program
Proposals ranging project develop analyze innovative computational method interdisciplinary team project create new mathematical computational technique use model study solve important application problem The primary emphasis computational science solution problem development useful computational tool rather proof theorem

Computational Thinking available

Chandrajit Bajaj director ICES Center Computational Visualization computer science professor research develops visualization software used simulate important biological structure ribosome
On surface computer science computational science seem like interchangeable term practitioner insist radical distinction
Simply put computational science involves programming high performance supercomputer science engineering purpose
Computer science generally refers broader design programming computer
The two indisputably overlap computational science tends involve partnership discipline outside computer science
At The University Texas Austin percent faculty degree engineering science math opposed computer science
Unlike traditional counterpart perform experiment laboratory ICES faculty simulate model experiment supercomputer
Computer science define computational science say professor mechanical engineering deputy director ICES director ICES Center Predictive Engineering Computational Sciences
Instead tool enables computer applied investigate scientific question
Computer science includes thing computer build system kind thing
Computational science application computer advance science largely modeling simulating physical world Moser said
The majority institute graduate student undergraduate degree engineering mathematics
In fact enter institute Computational Science Engineering Mathematics CSEM program little computer science experience say ICES graduate advisor leader ICES Computational Hydraulics Group
But enrolled graduate student learn programming language operating system visualization software parallel computing
They learn gamut everything know computer research
So pretty steep learning curve said Dawson
But absolutely necessary skill learn computational scientist apply computer toward understanding complex phenomenon engineering natural science
Take turbulence example
It problem must addressed engineering variety item aircraft golf ball chaotic ephemeral nature make difficult study conventional experimental analytical mean
But using computational method ICES researcher simulated billon point turbulent flow enabling phenomenon studied new detail
It go beyond basic science
CSEM student Travis Sanders degree engineering say advancement computational science affect method used engineer industry
The people ICES discover enhance tool engineer develop application show Another way understand difference computer science computational science outside application look underlying math said Keshav Pingali director ICES Center Distributed Grid Computing
Since computational science often used describe physical phenomenon like fluid flow heat transfer defining mathematics usually continuous based mathematical field calculus
In contrast mathematics computer science discrete involving operation finite matrix set
However investigate physical world using computer continuous must made discrete answer computed finite value
This process called discretization defining mechanism link computer science computational science together
The need discretization gave rise finite element method ICES famous world said Pingali describing hallmark computational science technique break continuous math smaller finite part computer analyze
It Pingali opinion computational science helped shape computer powerful ubiquitous processor today
In particular call FORTRAN first programming language
The language short FORmula TRANslation developed IBM simplify coding process computationally intense problem science engineering
And although developed scientific need FORTRAN served inspiration language applied across software program today
A big chunk computer science got start computational science
It one main reason computer science took like said Pingali
ICES researcher often investigate aspect computer hardware software essential conducting computational science
For example Pingali Galois system manipulates serial code run parallel system like supercomputer often system efficiently compute large amount data associated complex simulation
And George Biros leader ICES Parallel Algorithms Data Analysis Simulation Group recently help develop energy efficient circuit system
From finding common mathematical ground discretization reliance computer two field despite notable difference lot common
And although computer science define computational science essential constituent part according ICES Director Tinsley Oden describes computational science lying intersection mathematics computer science core discipline science The University Texas Street POB University Station Austin Texas

BIDS visiting scholar Lorena Barba posted great blog post computational thinking kindly willing let u blog
Check
President Obama month ago announced initiative
Reactions quickly spread make clear important skill coding
But mean
As become buzzword sadly let conversation clear rhetoric get deeper meaning
To computational scientist essence interacting computer extension mind create discover
That popular message today
The idea computational thinking popularized Jeannette Wing article published ten year ago Viewpoint magazine leading society computer scientist
She label attitude skill set everyone learn use
The emphasis solving problem exploiting fundamental concept computer science abstraction decomposition recursion separation concern
In sum Wing equates computational thinking thinking like computer scientist
The Wing Viewpoint tremendously influential narrative paper citation checked Mar
Google Scholar
But took u detour original powerful idea envisioned year ago
On July I gave keynote SciPy Conference titled inviting leap idea computational thinking picture use computation create new knowledge learn constructivist sense
It turn original notion computational thinking envisioned Seymour Papert already encompasses learning I alluding
In turn popularized meaning computational thinking shallower le powerful idea I explain
I looked deeper matter talk Berkeley Institute Data Science October
The title intention expound I think really killer app education I declared SciPy
By weaving executable code content Jupyter make seamless communication human machine
Why effective learning
In Seymour Papert published book
Papert MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
Previously worked Geneva
Piaget developmental psychologist best known pioneering learning theory known constructivism simply put learner construct new knowledge mind interaction experience previous knowledge
Papert turn developed theory constructionism adding notion learning enhanced learner engaged In introduction Mindstorms Papert refers rise personal computer many people imagined permeating home life business
But thinking beyond role One striking comment follows couple page later phrase instruction evokes Papert unappealing idea vision course child must program computer
But vision pole apart contemporary call learning code
He visualizes programming computer conversation asserts learning communicate computer may change way learning take My central focus machine mind


Papert The phrase computational thinking appears Mindstorms without elaboration
We find detailed exposition idea paper An exploration space mathematics education whose barely Google Scholar citation pale Wing viewpoint piece
Here Papert explores several dimension along imagine mathematics education reformed time examines role computer education
To support rest analysis I picked four salient idea Papert paper Throughout Papert generous example experience child learning Logo programming language
He describes student using Logo object called RANDOM create color effect screen contrast school introducing probability using spinner dice
What child dowith new knowledge besides talk deal problem RANDOM mathematical object student naturally make new one say taking ease idea function composition function
Another example deal study law motion Papert proposes dynamic Objections natural ordering say could raise argument dynamic conceptually harder static need calculus
But reflects static nature Calculus may needed student old medium pencil paper hard medium fight Computing offer multiple new way representing motion making physic lucid simple
The goal use computational thinking forge contemporary message computational thinking
Wing refined meaning always focusing thinking like computer scientist
She highlight abstractionas important process computational thinking add pattern matching recursive thinking basic toolbox
Google developed set free online resource educator called BBC offer online tutorial called Bitesize section
Both list key concept decomposition abstraction pattern recognition algorithm
Google add automation data manipulation analysis simulation
The International Society Technology Education ISTE Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA published set resource called video slide deck booklet almost identical message previously mentioned
I detract value course valuable
The coding initiative etc
valuable Wing others quick declare computational thinking The contemporary message take orthogonal direction Papert ignoring Power Principle
It happened many powerful idea taught school like probability become reduced shallow manipulation seldom connects anything student experience important
Combing dozen article computational thinking emphasis low dimension understanding low power operational perspective low dimension content priming medium
fashioned mathematics dramatically abstract analytic way
And new math maybe overly abstract presentation computing
Papert point u opposite direction towards origin computing mathematics used think physic science economics



Harvey Mudd College increased percentage woman CS bring fun first CS course basing project relevant application giving student choice application topic making scary splitting student section without previous experience investing social cultural context
Education Papert say Another influential figure conversation computer science professor
His article Education Paving Way Computational Thinking emphasizes theory computation using computing think world
With phrase understand computing appearing dozen time seems article equates computational thinking thinking disempowering idea
What interesting Guzdial worked tenaciously introduce computing contextualized fashion approach
In TEDx talk MediaComp Guzdial use word abstraction instead student IBM Fellow Chief Scientist poked idea computational thinking right direction
He noted human outsourced part brain device changing way go world
There incredible expressiveness algorithm Booch say
His word hint computing technology literacy
But still attached Wing language reducing idea back component abstraction data algorithm
Abstraction badge computer science integral mathematics philosophy science
And fixate decomposition pattern algorithm say nothing variable debugging
Naming thing essential computing idea object endowed certain inherent property computationally powerful
There many way draw computing representation knowledge help u think
The operational aspect making problem computable essential aspirational
Most people want computer scientist everyone use computer extension mind experience world create thing matter u
Computational thinking epitomized Jupyter IPython behind one biggest scientific discovery time LIGO collaboration
It help u analyze explain
It source power something figure thing dance computer thought
The inversion starting computing formal thing understand come application later take away power

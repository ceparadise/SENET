Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned
The detail hidden inside see

commonly referred research design use computer technology focused interface people computer
Researchers field HCI observe way human interact computer design technology let human interact computer novel way
As field research interaction situated intersection
The term popularized seminal book although author first used term first known use
The term connotes unlike tool limited us hammer useful driving nail much else computer many us take place dialog user computer
The notion dialog likens interaction interaction analogy crucial theoretical consideration field
Humans interact computer many way interface human computer crucial facilitating
Desktop application internet browser handheld computer computer kiosk make use prevalent GUI today
Voice user interface VUI used speech recognition synthesising system emerging Graphical user interface GUI allow human engage embodied character agent way achieved interface paradigm
The growth interaction field quality interaction different branching history
Instead designing regular interface different research branch different focus concept multimodality rather unimodality intelligent adaptive interface rather based one finally active rather passive interface
For instance recently sensor like video camera eye tracker used feed physiological information human back computer system
Such information used computer dynamically adapt content interface
Thus computer could develop responsiveness cognitive load human emotion
The ACM defines interaction discipline concerned design evaluation implementation interactive computing system human use study major phenomenon surrounding
An important facet HCI securing user satisfaction simply End User Computing Satisfaction
Because interaction study human machine communication draw supporting knowledge machine human side
On machine side technique development environment relevant
On human side discipline relevant
And course engineering design method relevant
Due multidisciplinary nature HCI people variety different background contribute success
HCI also sometimes termed HMI MMI CHI
Poorly designed lead many unexpected problem
A classic example nuclear meltdown accident investigation concluded design interface least partly responsible disaster
Similarly accident aviation resulted manufacturer decision use throttle quadrant layout even though new design proposed superior basic interaction pilot already ingrained standard layout thus conceptually good idea actually undesirable result
interaction study way human make make use computational artifact system infrastructure
In much research field seek interaction improving computer interface
How usability precisely understood relates social cultural value may desirable property computer interface increasingly debated
Much research field interaction take interest Visions researcher field seek achieve vary
When pursuing cognitivist perspective researcher HCI may seek align computer interface mental model human activity
When pursuing perspective researcher HCI may seek align computer interface existing social practice existing sociocultural value
Researchers HCI interested developing new design methodology experimenting new device prototyping new software hardware system exploring new interaction paradigm developing model theory interaction
HCI differs HCI focus user working specifically computer rather kind machine designed artifact
There also focus HCI implement computer software hardware mechanism support interaction
Thus broader term HCI could described human factor computer although expert try differentiate area
HCI also differs human factor le focus repetitive task procedure much le emphasis physical stress physical form user interface
Three area study substantial overlap HCI even focus inquiry shift
In study PIM human interaction computer placed larger informational context people may work many form information many whiteboards notebook sticky note refrigerator magnet order understand effect desired change world
In CSCW emphasis placed use computing system support collaborative work group people
The principle HIM extend scope CSCW organizational level implemented without use computer
When evaluating current designing new user interface important keep mind following experimental design principle Repeat iterative design process sensible interface created
A number diverse methodology outlining technique emerged since rise field
Most design methodology stem model user designer technical system interact
Early methodology example treated user cognitive process predictable quantifiable encouraged design practitioner look cognitive science result area memory attention designing user interface
Modern model tend focus constant feedback conversation user designer engineer push technical system wrapped around type experience user want rather wrapping around completed system
Displays artifact designed support perception relevant system variable facilitate processing information
Before display designed task display intended support must defined
navigating controlling decision making learning entertaining etc
A user operator must able process whatever information system generates display therefore information must displayed according principle manner support perception situation awareness understanding
Christopher Wickens et al
defined principle display design book
These principle human perception information processing utilized create effective display design
A reduction error reduction required training time increase efficiency increase user satisfaction many potential benefit achieved utilization principle
Certain principle may applicable different display situation
Some principle may seem conflicting simple solution say one principle important another
The principle may tailored specific design situation
Striking functional balance among principle critical effective design

A display legibility critical necessary designing usable display
If character object displayed discernible operator effectively make use

Do ask user determine level variable basis single sensory variable
colour size loudness
These sensory variable contain many possible level

Signals likely perceived interpreted accordance expected based user experience
If signal presented contrary user expectation physical evidence signal may need presented assure understood correctly

If signal presented likely understood correctly
This done presenting signal alternative physical form
colour shape voice print etc
redundancy imply repetition
A traffic light good example redundancy colour position redundant

Signals appear similar likely confused
The ratio similar feature different feature cause signal similar
For example similar
Unnecessarily similar feature removed dissimilar feature highlighted

A display look like variable represents
high temperature thermometer shown higher vertical level
If multiple element configured manner look like would represented environment

Moving element move pattern direction compatible user mental model actually move system
For example moving element altimeter move upward increasing altitude

When user attention diverted one location another access necessary information associated cost time effort
A display design minimize cost allowing frequently accessed source located nearest possible position
However adequate legibility sacrificed reduce cost

Divided attention two information source may necessary completion one task
These source must mentally integrated defined close mental proximity
Information access cost low achieved many way
proximity linkage common colour pattern shape etc
However close display proximity harmful causing much clutter

A user easily process information across different resource
For example visual auditory information presented simultaneously rather presenting visual auditory information

A user need retain important information solely working memory retrieve memory
A menu checklist another display aid user easing use memory
However use memory may sometimes benefit user eliminating need reference type knowledge world expert computer operator would rather use direct command memory refer manual
The use knowledge user head knowledge world must balanced effective design

Proactive action usually effective reactive action
A display attempt eliminate cognitive task replace simpler perceptual task reduce use user mental resource
This allow user focus current condition consider possible future condition
An example predictive aid road sign displaying distance certain destination

Old habit display easily transfer support processing new display designed consistently
A user memory trigger action expected appropriate
A design must accept fact utilize consistency among different display
The interface described point communication human user computer
The flow information human computer defined
The loop interaction several aspect including Topics HCI include study ordinary user could routinely tailor application need use power invent new application based understanding domain
With deeper knowledge knowledge domain user could increasingly important source new application expense generic system programmer system expertise low domain expertise
Computation passing beyond computer every object us found
Embedded system make environment alive little computation automated process computerized cooking appliance lighting plumbing fixture window blind automobile braking system greeting card
To extent development already taking place
The expected difference future addition networked communication allow many embedded computation coordinate user
embedded device many case different appropriate workstation
A common staple science fiction augmented reality refers notion layering relevant information vision world
Existing project show statistic user performing difficult task manufacturing
Future work might include augmenting social interaction providing additional information converse
In recent year explosion social science research focusing interaction unit analysis
Much research draw psychology social psychology sociology
For example one study found people expected computer man name cost machine woman name
Other research find individual perceive interaction computer positively human despite behaving way towards machine
In human computer interaction usually exists semantic gap human computer understanding towards mutual behavior
formal representation knowledge used address problem solving semantic ambiguity two party
Traditionally explained journal article discussing user modeling interaction computer use modeled dyad two connected narrow explicit communication channel terminal
Much work done make interaction computing system human reflective multidimensional nature everyday communication
However stated introduction much room mishap failure
Because potential issue interaction shifted focus beyond interface respond observation articulated Engelbart If ease use valid criterion people would stick tricycle never try bicycle
The mean human interact computer continues evolve rapidly
interaction affected force shaping nature future computing
These force include The future HCI based current promising research expected include following characteristic One main conference new research interaction annually held ACM usually referred short name CHI pronounced
CHI organized ACM Special Interest Group Interaction
CHI large conference thousand attendant quite broad scope
It attended academic practitioner industry people company sponsor Google Microsoft PayPal
There also dozen smaller regional specialized conference held around world year including

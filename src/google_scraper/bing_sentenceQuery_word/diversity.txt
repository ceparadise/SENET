The field software computing computer science plagued tremendous underrepresentation woman African Americans Hispanics
In high school Advanced Placement exam Computer Science worst gender diversity across course percent participation men percent woman
Participation student color percent
These underrepresented group represent percent entire US population
This problem extends software workplace suffers similar lack diversity
Obviously many issue address solve entire problem diversity tech workforce unconscious bias hiring retention practice university program
We work help connect work bigger picture
The chart show participation AP Computer Science exam among female student underrepresented minority since
Not overall participation grown overall proportion traditionally underrepresented group increasing
Although chart barometer work popularize computer science break stereotype build pipeline improvement result work alone
Besides organization working diversity tech real credit belongs thousand teacher worked year improve diversity classroom
While thing moving right direction long way go reach balanced population AP Computer Science focus entire pathway
Addressing diversity issue foundational work woven throughout program curriculum teacher professional learning advocacy marketing
We focus gender socioeconomic diversity also increasing participation among underrepresented minority African Americans student Native Native Islanders
We increase diversity computer science reaching student background school way inspire keep learning
Of course teacher integrate computer science classroom student attend immediate impact diversity
Though black Latinx American Indian Native Pacific Islander student dramatically underrepresented university computer science department making CS major AP Computer Science exam may seem le interested studying computer science white Asian peer
But participation course suggests opposite
We ran analysis high school CS Principles classroom turn underrepresented minority choose sign CS class much higher rate national AP data would suggest
The chart show data hundred computer science classroom
We compared percent underrepresented minority school whole percent among student enroll course
The orange dot represent computer science classroom diverse school whole
The blue dot le diverse
Almost classroom diverse school whole classroom track close even balance
When teacher administrator diverse school offer curriculum designed support underrepresented minority participation high school dramatically exceeds nationwide number reality tech industry today
Below example tactic use address diversity issue
From elementary school way high school course designed specifically focus diversity recruitment traditionally underrepresented student
This factored curriculum
For example high school course sequencing begin student unit instead jumping directly computer programming allows student learn together even playing field even student already learned code summer camp school
Across produce recruited wide cast lecturer featuring celebrated technologist like Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg also woman underrepresented minority computing Paola Minaya hispanic engineer Microsoft Tess Winlock female engineer Google Makinde Adeagbo early African American engineer Facebook Pinterest Kate Starbird WNBA basketball player computer scientist University Washington
By casting wide range lecturer diverse CS role model different industry baked curriculum material
The result speak All professional development workshop teacher include session equity access help teacher build awareness stereotype give tool recruit retain diverse CS student population
We also host professional development workshop district administrator counselor play critical role helping high school student choose field study order guide help recruit diverse student new computer science help establish school
By focusing effort school underserved population particularly urban rural geography reach student typically participate computer science
The result evident course designed ground broaden participation computer science
Endorsed College Board course prepares student new AP exam computer science
helped expand access course urban school district New York City Chicago Oakland well rural school Idaho Alabama
Because focus reaching underprivileged student underrepresented minority enrolled CS Principles classroom total nation AP Computer Science exam taker
Our early advocacy effort focused allowing rigorous computer science course count towards math science high school graduation requirement
Polling done Computer Science Teachers Association show woman underrepresented minority decide whether study Computer Science key factor choice whether count graduation credit
In state computer science count towards high school graduation enrollment underrepresented minority percent higher state
past success changing graduation policy state hopefully improve enrollment underrepresented group
As simple example showed policy resulting female representation computer science
Moving forward advocacy effort focused expanding access computer science especially underprivileged school
By offering computer science every school increase enrollment among female increase among African American female
This show massive impact state policy CS help advocacy effort state
The Hour Code international campaign recruit student try computer science one hour
A significant reason break stereotype CS nerdy boy showing student everybody
This stereotype prime reason girl avoid CS
The way organizing participation recruiting teacher offer Hour Code classroom
These math teacher english teacher science teacher balance boy girl communicate anybody try
A student participating Hour Code showed significant improvement attitude towards computer science The result speak million hour served participant female Hour Code effort introduce computer science girl
We also distributed CS teacher help recruit woman classroom
For example produced video specifically highlighting female role model talking importance learning computer science
We also proud according woman team

It Friday evening
I lying bed phone hand reading class spread next
They conveniently slipped mind past half hour I pay heed I suddenly remember photo I posted Instagram yesterday
Guess work I church since I arrived Stanford week ago past Sunday minute
I accompanied incessant baby yelping cue every second group tourist taking Christmas card picture front main altar mother loudly whispering direction Desk Editor Back high school Khalil Griffin feel comfortable taking computer science class
In high school I stereotyped CS Griffin said
Everyone else class At Stanford Griffin gave CS another shot majored
Yet still recognized lack racial diversity among peer professor CS class
In first week last quarter Griffin spoke major advisor Stephen Cooper concern
Now Griffin five CS major getting ready attend ACM Richard Tapia Celebration Diversity Computing Conference next month Boston expense paid School Engineering
VICTOR Stanford Daily While Stanford representative attended national diversity conference year mark first time Stanford serf platinum supporter contributed event according Valerie Taylor executive director national Center Minorities People Disabilities Information Technology
The investment conference one example CS department latest collaboration student address support ethnic diversity among CS undergraduate population recent effort department turning attention according Cooper associate professor CS
We realized need becoming aggressive trying support student Cooper said
While student largely agreed ethnic diversity CS major Stanford fare much better peer institution recognized still work done create welcoming environment underrepresented minority department
When Pablo Hernandez took CS Programming Abstractions freshman year quickly made unsettling realization
I sitting room I realized I like one four Latinos class huge problem Hernandez said
Jordan Miller president Stanford Society Black Students Engineers SBSE said issue stereotype threat underrepresented minority feeling belonging CS others class look like still prevalent problem Stanford
Taylor leading speaker importance diversity computing said feeling isolation among minority student CS lead retention issue fewer student color choose stay computing field
This turn add pipeline issue enough racially diverse CS professor serve mentor future student
Keith Schwarz
lecturer CS recognizes various stereotype exist computer science turn several people away field
With computer science easy get people bounce right Schwarz said
You make stuff arbitrarily VICTOR Stanford Daily When Griffin approached advisor last quarter concern lack ethnic diversity CS Stanford learned took student initiative drawing faculty attention issue get thing rolling
Cooper noted similar strategy led collaborative effort last year addressing lack woman CS
Students brought gender gap issue attention faculty led creation woman CS student group
Tara Balakrishnan Women Computer Science said CS department serf support program woman CS offering fund help put event announcing group event introductory class
Schwarz said started getting involved effort support woman CS learning issue student realized past summer department done lot outreach diversity group
After contacting SBSE Stanford Society Latino Engineers SOLE group soon learned student coming together start initiative address ethnic diversity CS DiversityBase
The initiative beginning stage brings together CS major various ethnic engineering society campus form network peer mentor underclassman friendly community within CS field according Jorge Aguirre president SOLE one student leader DiversityBase
The CS department really excited want push need energy way lot closer student body Aguirre added
While Schwarz look forward initiative role addressing concern underrepresented minority CS student also recognize CS department still contribute cause way
We much organization Miller said SBSE effort create welcoming environment CS member
One concern Miller said certain black CS major face lecture unable resonate presented material want find way use skill learn class able give back community rather find way make money Silicon Valley
Opening possibility CS degree engineering degree really resonates community Miller said
To address concern Schwarz like present example introductory class lecture CS look like way defies stereotype
One example mobile app development big communication system would allow texting Kenya mobile technology much prevalent topic
We done bit piece
We Schwarz said CS department effort address issue ethnic diversity
With field computing ubiquitous society Taylor CS department invited speak campus spring said demographic field must align society demographic whole
Whether program CS department investment resource CS faculty student recognize benefit increasing ethnic diversity CS campus
Schwarz said one tactical benefit come increase ethnic diversity even gender diversity member underrepresented community better address problem prevalent specifically group
I think important people background access sort create solution enables solve important pressing problem normally get lot attention Schwarz said
Others like Griffin hope bring back diversity strategy upcoming conference apply Stanford said diverse voice would contribute fresh new perspective field computer science otherwise lost
While student faculty agreed still much done party fully address diversity concern department field CS overall work towards solution underway
Everyone really seem care question best Schwarz said

Lisa Baer little hesitation making decision freshman year major computer science
Now looking forward graduating Arizona State University spring Baer said never choice
In fact passionate ever pursuit career computer scientist
But despite confidence gained ability field past four year completely immune psychologist call impostor It feeling get accomplishment due merit fearing one day exposed disappoint people said
She alone among fellow female computer science student experiencing feeling
Studies say syndrome seems common even among particularly woman find situation feel place isolated gender
That describes kind environment found many computer science college classroom lab woman remain disproportionately small minority
You might think woman class would make feel special
But really said Nichola Lubold earned undergraduate degree computer engineering working doctoral degree computer science
I never felt I good enough said
But still get feeling maybe I belong maybe right Wu assistant professor computer science ASU Ira Fulton Schools Engineering said see kind doubt prevalent among female student make percent computer science major university
As result really bright student stay program Wu said
She point addition small percentage peer among female computer science major number female faculty member program also comparatively low
So student see lot role model see friendly environment good future field said
To try change situation Wu faculty colleague worked establish maintain support scholarship program send many woman Fulton Schools computer science program annual
The event produced Anita Borg Institute Women Technology presented partnership Association Computing Machinery world largest technical conference woman computing drawing participant country
With grant Anita Borg Institute BRAID initiative additional support one Fulton Schools School Computing Informatics Decision Systems ASU ASU female computer science student able earn scholarship make trip Houston Grace Hopper conference October
At least ASU student also attended support company working intern
The event feature leader field industry academia government presentation research opportunity networking mentoring career fair seeking job student internship
In addition professional development session geared address particular concern woman working world
Students get chance see learn woman making significant contribution computing seek professional relationship could nurture throughout career Wu said
It good place meet people various stage career especially woman dealing career family life challenge different time life said
Students learn people successfully dealt Baer said invaluable student feel sense community like part something important make real Lubold want child still building career said conference given opportunity hear woman I career learn Nichole Emmons graduating bachelor degree December call conference really powerful experience
It amazing see impact younger student one tell thought wondering whether want field said
The conference give new perspective people relate
You see going change Waverly Roeger receive bachelor degree spring one student
Talking listening others coped feeling outsider within field study made feel I belong huge weight lifted said
The conference also helped see challenge facing sign lack ability
You learn obstacle woman overcame success happen genius Roeger said
You see took year hard work build The student emphatic profession contribute society practitioner diverse
When bring different kind people table wellspring creativity Lubold said
We come new technology solution adapted different need wider range Emmons said select group people involved making using new technology lot people going left future technologist creating
The Grace Hopper conference inspiring motivating Roeger said also see lot still done bring awareness importance diversity

She see need computer science expertise growing rapidly demand significantly exceed supply without woman field labor pool depleted
We looking maybe million unfilled job said
So important school big Fulton Schools ASU take challenge helping solve Much problem stem culturally ingrained attitude woman science computer science particular causing woman choose pursue career said
Many female high school even college student interested science engineering technical field often look around classroom see anyone look like said
Bliss spent decade leadership role Massachusetts Institute Technology Lincoln Laboratory Department Defense Research Development Laboratory said fortunate grow family tradition woman highly skilled technical job
Her mother engineer one grandmother led company technology division grandmother neurologist
As computer science undergraduate Cornell University usually one handful woman class male mentor gender matter said
They saw smart student help advance
I never questioned whether I The work environment MIT Lincoln Laboratory similarly supportive
If math mean could dress

The Cohoons lead workshop engaging teacher pedagogically appropriate way diversify computer science classroom thus increase number girl minority participating computer science course
Joanne Cohoon say student choose aspiration based three factor interest confidence sense belonging
Cultivating interest confidence valuable guarantee diversity one would hope
Active recruitment essential getting said
You good class appeal broad range student
Joanne Cohoon express concern girl often expected interest fundamentally different boy
She belief want broaden participation computer science incorporate topic interest girl boy
She talk attracting broader range student using social value computing like helping handicapped people navigate world assisting place major catastrophe
She think anyone say Girls come computing since interest equally attractive boy
The Tapestry workshop focus pedagogy recruiting also maintaining gender balance practice translate better teaching overall according workshop participant
When Seth Reichelson teacher Lake Brantley High School outside Orlando attended first Tapestry workshop several year ago thought pretty good product
Before attending Tapestry workshop stuff I thought great promotion class reality actually driving away student said
After Tapestry workshop I still making mistake I gradually getting better every day
Reichelson say became better teacher learned measure success
He began focus growth goal student looking student started ended rather homogenous standard
The student public high school embraced class successful teaching coding middle school student girl scout elementary student proud moment Autistic Spectrum Students
Reichelson teach computer science student girl making third class
My goal make Lake Brantley place everyone code said
Melody Hagaman Centennial High School Las Cruces student decent gender balance computer science class first attended Tapestry workshop
Afterward began actively recruit girl minority student using strategy even thought workshop
She approach group student girl underrepresented minority talk collaborative nature class opportunity work friend create program application based interest
I find much likely sign group individually commented
What tried extremely effective
Her program grew student percent girl
To make class engaging incorporated logic problem class
She noticed student really enjoy process tend willing solve problem asking help
This given student ownership learning added
She also noted problem solving skill spilled content area well
Not problem help engage student also recruitment booster
I love logic problem

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Would ever think I computer programmer
Lilibeth Perez stand front gymnasium holding microphone
She addressing crowd assembled TedxYouth event The School Columbia University
Imagine computer programmer say
You probably thought male Caucasian thirty poor social skill maybe poorly dressed
Would ever think I computer programmer
She look year old Latina Spanish Harlem wearing polka dot shirt skirt tights
I mean I think I pretty good dressing
The stereotype Lilibeth describes least way statistically accurate
Only percent student AP computer science class female percent student color
There many obstacle student like Lilibeth learn computer science
Only US high school student wealthy district might opportunity take computer science course student school never
If computing taught tends computer literacy necessary like word processing
Lilibeth take pride breaking stereotype
Not I computer programmer skilled Math science say I also athletic creative skilled writer
She opportunity learn programming enrolling class provided
ScriptEd start provides computer programming class school
The class taught professional programmer individual provide mentorship information student
With ScriptEd Lilibeth learned HTML CSS JavaScript
Over summer taught Ruby placed full time paid internship programming
Currently learning Python
Many ScriptEd student say never enrolled program would never opportunity learn code
This obviously unjust especially considering rich opportunity available individual computer science degree
While average salary computer programmer year software engineer Google even higher
Over job added annually however American institution fewer computer science degree year
Yet perhaps important even financial incentive power knowing program
As Douglass Rushkoff writes book creator technology hold future code
Existing technology defines interact one note Twitter Facebook Buzzfeed shaped consume interact news
New technology define parameter speak everything
Software developer create technology match experience
We endless iteration technological solution problem faced predominately white wealthy male elite San Francisco individual iPhone disposable income never wait cab thanks proliferation company like Uber Lyft Sidecar
However public transportation serf rest Bay Area remains notoriously unreliable
Whether one belief everyone programmer fact remains percent high school student never even opportunity learn wildly disproportionate number student female Hispanic African American
This extreme lack diversity unjust stagnates innovation
By teaching student computer science build future technology creator fueled diversity experience thought
This result powerful innovation benefit whole range community
Knowing code mean I make difference world way I never thought possible say ScriptEd alumnus Earl Clifton
I would never learned even career option I found ScriptEd
Organizations like ScriptEd give student resource mentorship skill necessary take control future become creator technology
We need give every student chance become programmer
Doing provide pathway opportunity underprivileged community build diverse body computer programmer create technology truly benefit everyone
Lilibeth graduating year plan double major computer science woman study
She first family graduate high school let alone graduate college
I want make sure child learn want spite stereotype say
Just think might create

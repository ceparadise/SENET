Compute node cluster access three type disk storage The storage intended used stage input file read multiple time well intermediate file
By convention use create use subdirectory username The local cluster storage considered scratch user expected clean file end job
Nodes fail one reason another often without warning resulting loss data stored partition
Given nature cluster network topology possible poorly designed job overwhelm network connection back file system
If job need access remote file multiple time data fit local disk encourage structure code first copy data node access locally
This result increased performance job job running cluster well
If timing code aware accessing file system introduces latency uncertainty
Be sure time computation otherwise measuring may dominated contention Ethernet switch node NFS server NFS server SAN switch disk array disk array
The cluster built using formerly PUIAS Linux distribution clone recompile RedHat Enterprise Linux rebranding
Scheduling done MPICH LAM library collection use cluster environment also installed cluster
version parallel toolkit also available
It worth noting license cluster toolkit able use toolkit achieve higher parallelism
To find available software please check page
If need software package library currently installed compute node please contact CS Staff
If already available repository RPM distribution able install within one business day
Packages available RPM take longer prepare automated configuration management system
Please note might globally install highly specialized package unlikely used others department package conflict already installed package
In case may need install locally home directory project space access
We recommend read information submitting managing job
The scheduler assign job resource using information available
Note assign priority user group
As result time especially near conference deadline user may need coordinate amongst
For example request others hold submitting job day
To use cluster simply using CS username password
This put head node home directory
From submit job Slurm scheduler using command single process job combine MPI job
Details
The head node may used interactive work file editing
The head node may used computationally intensive process
As computational software completely absent head node
It possible get email notification job begin end abort
If submit many job short period time make sure email account prepared receive
That make sure sufficient space Inbox email provider accept message potentially high rate
The CS email system accept message cluster high rate
Because external site frequently blacklist throttle mail server inundated message high rate must send cluster email notification
If forwarding CS Princeton email account external provider Gmail please set filter way prevent forwarding message cluster
These message identified sender address slurm
Those job send large amount output STDOUT STDERR redirect output appropriately job submission script
Otherwise compute node spooling space may fill causing running job fail preventing new job starting
The cluster may brought hardware failure maintenance
Long running job designed regularly checkpoint state resumed event interruption without start entire job
There number different job type run cluster including MPI job single processor job interactive job
These type discussed detail
MPI job run single application multiple CPUs using MPI library call coordinate processing among different CPUs
Single processor job name implies run single CPU
Both job typically initiated creating job file shell script
Interactive job allow user run computationally intensive interactive program cluster developing workload batch job
Jobs submitted cluster using command
The job script always run user current working directory
The submission directory available running job environment variable
Additional shell environment variable maintained scheduling system available script runtime
For list variable see page command
Yes job exceeds requested walltime killed scheduler
If request walltime default hour
The maximum walltime request given job hour one week
For reason good idea ensure job checkpointing capability job killed fails reason lose work already performed
If wish use GPU board must specify need GPU resource using option specify many GPU device job need
Therefore sbatch option like request GPU node GPU capability
Please ensure GPU code respect variable binding GPU mechanism GPUs scheduled allocated
Jobs found using GPUs allocated may killed
Interactive job ionic cluster initiated command head node
You may also want specify resource quantity Please use salloc run interactive job rather mechanism
Using mechanism start interactive job lead failure job accounting making appear though job running extremely inefficiently
Interactive job used troubleshooting mechanism creating batch submission work
If need help forming work batch submission please contact CS Staff happy help
We also ask avoid squatting compute node opening long interactive session without actively using since tie cluster resource could performing work user
Accordingly please make sure exit session finished
Interactive job appear idle long period time may cancelled CS Staff job queue waiting use resource
MPI job ionic cluster executed using command
Here example MPI job submission script
This script assumes script file MPI program binary directory
It specifies hour wall clock time processor node total CPUs
Be sure replace actual email address
Single processor job essentially program wish run batch mode
Just anything would program shell script done single processor job ionic cluster
Of course simplest form job one run single program
You notice job script similar one used MPI job
Again sure replace actual email address
In addition walltime node specify maximum amount physical virtual memory single process job likely use
Using output email add either per node option script
The last line output job completion email includes amount memory used job
If report job used something GB physical memory could modify script line like For future run job modification give scheduler hint job expected use memory
If single processor job need run multiple time exactly command argument like get away single job script command modify line replicate job
The example script run instance command single CPU different node
As example sure replace actual email address
The result script getting submitted using get run different machine
The major problem likely encounter job start job terminate unexpectedly
The first thing look diagnosing job problem STDIN STDOUT output job
Unless direct elsewhere STDIN STDOUT written file named
Another command useful diagnosis command
This command provides accounting information may helpful diagnosing unexpected behavior
Try command like

A computer cluster single logical unit consisting multiple computer linked LAN
The networked computer essentially act single much powerful machine
A computer cluster provides much faster processing speed larger storage capacity better data integrity superior reliability wider availability resource
Computer cluster however much costly implement maintain
This result much higher running overhead compared single computer
Many organization use computer cluster maximize processing time increase database storage implement faster data storing retrieving technique
There many type computer cluster including The major advantage using computer cluster clear organization requires large scale processing

Greg Pfister stated cluster invented specific vendor customer could fit work one computer needed backup
Pfister estimate date time
The formal engineering basis cluster computing mean parallel work sort arguably invented published come regarded seminal paper parallel processing
The history early computer cluster le directly tied history early network one primary motivation development network link computing resource creating de facto computer cluster
The first production system designed cluster Burroughs
This allowed four computer either one two processor tightly coupled common disk storage subsystem order distribute workload
Unlike standard multiprocessor system computer could restarted without disrupting overall operation
The first commercial loosely coupled clustering product Attached Resource Computer ARC system developed using cluster interface
Clustering per se really take released product operating system named OpenVMS
The ARC VAXcluster product supported parallel computing also shared device
The idea provide advantage parallel processing maintaining data reliability uniqueness
Two noteworthy early commercial cluster circa product also circa primarily business use
Within time frame computer cluster used parallelism outside computer commodity network began use within computer
Following success delivered introduced internal parallelism via
While early supercomputer excluded cluster relied time fastest supercomputer
relied cluster architecture
Computer cluster may configured different purpose ranging general purpose business need support scientific calculation
In either case cluster may use approach
Note attribute described exclusive computer cluster may also use approach
cluster configuration share computational workload provide better overall performance
For example web server cluster may assign different query different node overall response time optimized
However approach may significantly differ among application
cluster used scientific computation would balance load different algorithm cluster may use simple assigning new request different node
Computer cluster used purpose rather handling operation web service database
For instance computer cluster might support vehicle crash weather
Very tightly coupled computer cluster designed work may approach

HA cluster implementation attempt use redundancy cluster component eliminate
There commercial implementation cluster many operating system
The project one commonly used HA package operating system
Clusters primarily designed performance mind installation based many factor fault tolerance also allows simpler scalability high performance situation low frequency maintenance routine resource consolidation centralized management
Other advantage include enabling data recovery event disaster providing parallel data processing high processing capacity
One issue designing cluster tightly coupled individual node may
For instance single computer job may require frequent communication among node implies cluster share dedicated network densely located probably homogeneous node
The extreme computer job us one node need little communication approaching
In Beowulf system application program never see computational node also called slave computer interact Master specific computer handling scheduling management slave
In typical implementation Master two network interface one communicates private Beowulf network slave general purpose network organization
The slave computer typically version operating system local memory disk space
However private slave network may also large shared file server store global persistent data accessed slave needed
A special purpose tuned running astrophysical simulation using parallel treecode rather general purpose scientific computation
Due increasing computing power generation novel use emerged repurposed HPC cluster
Some example game console cluster cluster
Another example consumer game product workstation us multiple graphic accelerator processor chip
Besides game console graphic card used instead
The use graphic card rather GPU calculation grid computing vastly economical using CPU despite le precise
However using value become precise work CPU still much le costly purchase cost
Computer cluster historically run separate physical
With advent cluster node may run separate physical computer different operating system painted virtual layer look similar
The cluster may also virtualized various configuration maintenance take place
An example implementation virtualization manager
As computer cluster appearing
One element distinguished three class time early supercomputer relied
To date cluster typically use physically shared memory many supercomputer architecture also abandoned
However use essential modern computer cluster
Examples include Microsoft
Two widely used approach communication cluster node MPI PVM
PVM developed around MPI available
PVM must directly installed every cluster node provides set software library paint node parallel virtual machine
PVM provides environment task resource management fault notification
PVM used user program written C Fortran etc
MPI emerged early discussion among organization
The initial effort supported
Rather starting anew design MPI drew various feature available commercial system time
The MPI specification gave rise specific implementation
MPI implementation typically use socket connection
MPI widely available communication model enables parallel program written language etc
Thus unlike PVM provides concrete implementation MPI specification implemented system
One challenge use computer cluster cost administrating time high cost administrating N independent machine cluster N node
In case provides advantage lower administration cost
This also made popular due ease administration
When large cluster need access large amount data becomes challenge
In heterogeneous cluster complex application environment performance job depends characteristic underlying cluster
Therefore mapping task onto CPU core GPU device provides significant challenge
This area ongoing research algorithm combine extend proposed studied
When node cluster fails strategy may employed keep rest system operational
Fencing process isolating node protecting shared resource node appears malfunctioning
There two class fencing method one disables node disallows access resource shared disk
The method stand Shoot The Other Node In The Head meaning suspected node disabled powered
For instance us power controller turn inoperable node
The approach disallows access resource without powering node
This may include via fibre channel fencing disable port GNBD fencing disable access GNBD server
Load balancing cluster web server use cluster architecture support large number user typically user request routed specific node achieving without cooperation given main goal system providing rapid user access shared data
However computer cluster perform complex computation small number user need take advantage parallel processing capability cluster partition computation among several node
program continues remain technical challenge used effectuate higher via simultaneous execution separate portion program different processor

Speculative software parallelism gained renewed interest recently mechanism leverage multiple core emerging architecture
Two major mechanism used implement parallelism software software transactional memory speculative thread
We propose third mechanism based checkpoint restart
With recent development checkpoint restart technology become attractive alternative
The approach potential advantage conceptual simplicity transactional memory flexibility speculative thread
Since many checkpoint restart system work large distributed memory program provides automatic way perform distributed speculation cluster
Additionally since checkpoint restart system primarily designed fault tolerance using system speculation could provide fault tolerance within speculative execution well embedded application fault tolerance desirable
In paper use series study relative performance speculative system based DMTCP checkpoint restart system compare thread level speculative system

enterprise single pool storage
A storage system also known storage array
Storage system typically use special hardware software along disk drive order provide fast reliable storage computing data processing
Storage system complex may thought special purpose computer designed provide storage capacity along advanced data protection feature
Disk drive one element within storage system along hardware special purpose embedded software within system
Storage system provide either block accessed storage file accessed storage
Block access typically delivered protocol
File access often provided using protocol
Within context storage system two primary type virtualization occur Virtualization storage help achieve location independence abstracting physical location data
The virtualization system present user logical space data storage handle process mapping actual physical location
It possible multiple layer virtualization mapping
It possible output one layer virtualization used input higher layer virtualization
Virtualization map space resource resource
In instance refers LUN presented computer host system direct use
A LUN volume presented host computer system use
The actual form mapping depend chosen implementation
Some implementation may limit granularity mapping may limit capability device
Typical granularity range single physical disk small subset multiple megabyte gigabyte physical disk
In storage environment single block information addressed using LUN identifier offset within LUN known LBA
The virtualization software device responsible maintaining consistent view mapping information virtualized storage
This mapping information often called stored mapping table
The address space may limited capacity needed maintain mapping table
The level granularity total addressable space directly impact size hence mapping table
For reason common amount addressable capacity granularity access granularity
One common method address limit use multiple level virtualization
In several storage system deployed today common utilize three layer virtualization
Some implementation use mapping table instead calculate location using algorithm
These implementation utilize dynamic method calculate location access rather storing information mapping table
The virtualization software device us request
It receive incoming request containing information location data term logical disk vdisk translates new request physical disk location
For example virtualization device may Most implementation allow heterogeneous management storage device within scope given implementation support matrix
This mean following capability limited single vendor device similar capability provided specific storage controller fact possible across different vendor device
Data replication technique limited virtualization appliance described detail
However implementation provide replication service
When storage virtualized replication service must implemented software device performing virtualization
This true virtualization layer true consistent image logical disk vdisk copied
This limit service implementation implement make seriously difficult implement
If virtualization implemented network higher render replication service provided underlying storage controller useless
The physical storage resource aggregated storage pool logical storage created
More storage system may heterogeneous nature added needed virtual storage space scale amount
This process fully transparent application using storage infrastructure
The software device providing storage virtualization becomes common disk manager virtualized environment
Logical disk vdisks created virtualization software device mapped made visible required host server thus providing common place way managing volume environment
Enhanced feature easy provide environment One major benefit abstracting host server actual storage ability data maintaining concurrent access
The host know logical disk mapped LUN change mapping transparent host
This mean actual data moved replicated another physical location without affecting operation client
When data copied moved simply updated point new location therefore freeing physical storage old location
The process moving physical location known
Most implementation allow done manner concurrently host continues perform logical disk LUN
The mapping granularity dictate quickly updated much extra capacity required migration quickly previous location marked free
The smaller granularity faster update le space required quicker old storage freed
There many day day task storage administrator perform simply concurrently performed using data migration technique
Utilization increased virtue pooling migration thin provisioning service
This allows user avoid storage solution
In word kind utilization shared pool storage easily quickly allocated needed avoid constraint storage capacity often hinder application performance
When available storage capacity pooled system administrator longer search disk free space allocate particular host server
A new logical disk simply allocated available pool existing disk expanded
Pooling also mean available storage capacity potentially used
In traditional environment entire disk would mapped host
This may larger required thus wasting space
In virtual environment logical disk LUN assigned capacity required using host
Storage assigned needed point time reducing need much given host need future
Using administrator create large thin provisioned logical disk thus using system think large disk day one
With storage virtualization multiple independent storage device even scattered across network appear single monolithic storage device managed centrally
However traditional storage controller management still required
That creation maintenance array including error fault management
Once abstraction layer place virtualizer know data actually resides physical medium
Backing virtual storage environment therefore requires reconstruction logical disk contiguous disk used traditional manner
Most implementation provide form procedure data migration service least possible time consuming
Interoperability key enabler virtualization software device
It applies actual physical storage controller host operating system software connectivity hardware
Interoperability requirement differ based implementation chosen
For example virtualization implemented within storage controller add extra overhead host based interoperability require additional support storage controller virtualized software
Switch based virtualization may require specific host interoperability us packet cracking technique redirect
Network based appliance highest level interoperability requirement interoperate device storage host
Complexity affect several area Information one valuable asset today business environment
Once virtualized glue middle
If lost actual data would virtually impossible reconstruct logical drive without mapping information
Any implementation must ensure protection appropriate level replica
It important able reconstruct event catastrophic failure
The management also implication performance
Any virtualization software device must able keep copy atomic quickly updateable
Some implementation restrict ability provide certain fast update function copy caching super fast update required ensure minimal latency actual performed
In implementation performance physical storage actually improved mainly due caching
Caching however requires visibility data contained within request limited symmetric virtualization software device
However implementation also directly influence latency request cache miss due flow software device
Assuming software device efficiently designed impact minimal compared latency associated physical disk access
Due nature virtualization mapping logical physical requires processing power lookup table
Therefore every implementation add small amount latency
In addition response time concern throughput considered
The bandwidth lookup software directly impact available system bandwidth
In asymmetric implementation lookup occurs information read written bandwidth le concern tiny fraction actual size
symmetric flow design directly limited processing power connectivity bandwidth
Most implementation provide form model inclusion additional software device instance provides increased scalability potentially increased bandwidth
The performance scalability characteristic directly influenced chosen implementation
virtualization requires additional software running host privileged task process
In case volume management built operating system instance offered separate product
Volumes LUN presented host system handled traditional physical device driver
However software layer volume manager resides disk device driver intercept request provides lookup mapping
Most modern operating system form logical volume management Linux called LVM Solaris FreeBSD zpool layer Windows called LDM performs virtualization task
Note Host based volume manager use long term coined
Like virtualization several category existed year recently classified virtualization
Simple data storage device like single provide virtualization
But even simplest provide logical physical abstraction use scheme join multiple disk single array possibly later divide array smaller volume
Advanced disk array often feature cloning snapshot remote replication
Generally device provide benefit data migration replication across heterogeneous storage vendor tends use proprietary protocol
A new breed disk array controller allows downstream attachment storage device
For purpose article discus later style actually virtualize storage device
A primary storage controller provides service allows direct attachment storage controller
Depending implementation may different vendor
The primary controller provide pooling management service
It may also provide replication migration service across controller
Storage virtualization operating network based device typically standard server smart switch using iSCSI FC network connect
These type device commonly available implemented form virtualization
The virtualization device sits SAN provides layer abstraction host performing storage controller providing storage capacity
There two commonly available implementation storage virtualization
Both model provide service disk management metadata lookup data migration replication
Both model also require processing hardware provide service
Appliance based device dedicated hardware device provide SAN connectivity one form another
These sit host storage case symmetric appliance provide benefit service discussed article
request targeted appliance performs mapping redirecting sending request underlying storage
The appliance also provide caching data implementation provide form clustering individual appliance maintain atomic view metadata well cache data
Switch based device name suggests reside physical switch hardware used connect SAN device
These also sit host storage may use different technique provide metadata mapping packet cracking snoop incoming request perform redirection
It much difficult ensure atomic update metadata switched environment service requiring fast update data metadata may limited switched implementation
also known virtualization device actually sit data path host storage
All request data pas device
Hosts perform virtualization device never interact actual storage device
The virtualization device turn performs storage device
Caching data statistic data usage replication service data migration thin provisioning easily implemented device
also known virtualization device sometimes called
These device perform mapping function
This requires additional software host know first request location actual data
Therefore request host intercepted leaf host lookup requested server may interface SAN return physical location data host
The information retrieved actual request storage
Caching possible data never pass device
A synonym used NAS virtualization

The need virtual memory arises fact How CPU execute program instruction program binary large loaded DRAM
System may running low physical memory allowing loader load page executable memory
Even process currently sitting memory swapped physical memory requirement new process met
The question execute program case
This virtual aka unreal memory come place
How really relying fact order run program need load page memory

To begin execution program aka process
As CPU make reference physical page corresponding reference present DRAM physical page memory need accessed resident memory
OS need handle page fault
The faulting process put sleep page fault handler bring desired page disk memory update page table
Note done address translation already happened via MMU logical address generated CPU translated physical address page table
How demand paging help related virtual memory
The fundamental concept entire program need loaded memory CPU begin execution
There might certain code section may never executed
Thus benefit loading simply keeping memory
As physical reference made desired page happens memory well good
If process page fault page loaded memory may result swapping existing page back disk
The faulting instruction restarted
This principle behind virtual memory
Each process contiguous virtual address space comprising code data bs heap stack region
Virtual address space contiguous range logical address one generated CPU
For example running program memory requirement bit system
The virtual address space range allow u address physical memory max
It would lesser OS kernel code data structure
A logical address translated physical address physical frame offset frame
This main thing understand
Even though process logical address range work virtual memory allows u use keep physical page process memory
If computer lack random access memory RAM needed run program operation Windows us virtual memory compensate
Virtual memory combine computer RAM temporary space hard disk
When RAM run low virtual memory move data RAM space called paging file
Two reason main one originally computer memory extremely expensive think million dollar per megabyte finding way conserve make machine act available memory actually prime motivation
Today cost much concern another benefit way virtual memory work allows virtual address far apart mapped physical memory actually nearby
This allows operation memory cache efficient result performance gain long use secondary disk storage place real memory significant

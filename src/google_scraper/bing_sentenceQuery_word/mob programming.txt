By end degree confident programming similar language Java
Some college also teach student code Python PHP JavaScript since conceptual requirement computer science degree demanding college expect student learn programming time
You need degree find work small freelance programming job gain experience picking job feel qualified complete
You also download source code software submit revision feel benefit project
If work quite meet project standard revision reverted project administrator
While studying computer architecture probably learn assembly programming language designed send system call directly underlying hardware
Assembly language different language Java Python programming job require high degree proficiency assembly
However thoroughly understand computer architecture compiler convert code machine code excellent programmer also pretty good grasp assembly programming
Depending degree track choose find work number different area
make small portion computer science graduate
Typically become developer choose software design track
You find employment data analysis network administration management information system following business track
To continue education bachelor degree choose science track
Researchers analyst administrator much programming application developer although write code need proficient different area
As researcher probably spend time reading writing programming actually programming
As use knowledge efficient design help business organize equipment productively possible
While many different type job available computer science graduate popularity computer science degree mean competition job high
Becoming proficient possible programming computer science help stand job applicant

For software design development many many task productivity always high priority pursuit seemingly supply new method continuous improvement newer one like
One newest approach outgrowth Agile technique two programmer work together sharing single computer taking turn keyboard
We discovered Mob Programming approach learning technique recall Woody Zuill Senior Consultant Agile development firm Industrial Logic phone interview
We using Coding Dojo style everyone work together single computer practice solving programming problem
The style based Llewellyn Falco pair programming method
Mob Programming say Zuill basically expansion approach working group one person keyboard enter edit code everyone else working together go keyboard
The passing around keyboard based principle I idea I hand keyboard somebody else I explain draw whiteboard discus keyed computer
And hour working Mob say Zuill We realized working well wanted keep rest day
And end day decided keep working way following day
That four year ago
Zuill eventually wrote write blog post titled
The software project Zuill first Mobbing complex requiring input developer
So say Zuill We thought meant approach best suited solving complex problem quickly
But got good Mobbing realized also useful smaller simpler problem often find way abstract automate task easy repetitive like cleaning item database
Working team lot easier see pattern act
In November embedded software development firm already using Pair programming decided give Mobbing try based advice Nancy Van Schooenderwoert President technology training consulting firm
We adding engineer Nancy working several year suggested Mob Programming one way mature technical lead faster recall Bluefruit owner CEO Paul Massey
While Mobbing whole team around one keyboard sounded even le efficient Pairing decided give go
And worked
The place Mobbing helped merging code people working alone pair say Matthew Dodkins software architect Bluefruit
In day spent using traditional collaboration would first spend time agreeing task common goal deciding going away write code come back merge resolve problem
By bringing everyone room try merge frequently try almost continuous integration say Dodkins
A lot code get merged time
For big code project try time
When developer programming individually code week
None mob merges last day opposed working week learning meaning several people code fit together
We find Mobbing good solving complex problem dealing merges code multiple people say Dodkins
You get power everyone knowledge problem
It also positive learning social experience team member learn project contribute difficult problem blocking project
So far Bluefruit used Mob technique bit everything report Massey
We used project blue chip client like Electric Bike Home Information Systems may dozen engineer organized multiple team usually maximum six seven per team
And team six maybe one two engineer number smaller program client team may get together one morning per week
Cobol keep keeping time thanks support Micro Focus use latest IDG Communications Inc

software development approach whole team work thing time space computer
This similar two people sit computer collaborate code time
With Mob Programming collaboration extended everyone team still using single computer writing code inputting code base
It build principle lean manufacturing
Early use phrase mob programming made
In addition software coding mob programming team work together almost work typical software development team tackle defining requirement designing working customer business expert
Almost work handled working meeting workshop people involved creating software considered team member including customer business expert

RESOURCES software development approach whole team work thing time space computer
At first glance would appear daunting activity introvert
As introvert Mob Programmer I discovered enjoyable rewarding exercise challenge easy overcome
As I started writing paper I knew I introvert I completely sure I knew theory introversion
I decided research introversion exploring topic I kept finding reason theoretically I hate Mob Programming introvert FossWest
The odd part I like many extroverted colleague love Mob Programming Kerney
I ended spending significant amount time trying figure Mob Programming great would appeal introvert like probably hate practice
I studied computer science college head approach
I went class studied homework took test
Study group extracurricular activity comfortable
Knowing I know way team work learning life general apparent mistake
As introvert appeal wiser human I realized benefit occasionally stepping comfort zone
Something I wish I done college
I spent significant amount technology career QA Automation mostly traditional waterfall type environment
While satisfaction introvert high sitting cube day sporadic meeting professional satisfaction usually extremely low
There seemed like much waste disconnect environment
Work getting done usually sustainable pace low quality felt clumsy
Eventually I introduced Scrum
Initially satisfying
There seemed good balance individual time team time level teamwork product quality contribution felt better previous work environment
But felt like could even better
This ultimately led working current job Hunter Industries I worked past four year
All work Hunter done It defined whole team work thing time place computer
Zuill Mob Programming seen evolution Pair Programming participation go beyond two include whole team
As typically follow pattern
The driver role consists keyboard handling input usually provides minimal navigation
The remaining team member take role navigator providing direction driver
At time designated navigator team member still free contribute suggest research ask question
Roles rotated using timer time ranging two minute fifteen minute depending difficulty type work completed
I usually expect spend day driver remaining time navigator offering suggestion researching
I knew I enjoyed professional satisfaction I got working within team Mob Programming environment really seem foreign
There thing I acclimate introvert small size team made transition relatively uneventful

Why I hate Mob Programming introvert
Introverts prefer solitude
While Mob Programming team embrace time step away break recharge majority day spent group environment
The best could hope introvert pair programming Beck
Introverts prefer space
In environment work open floor plan designated space reserved specific individual
Introverts prefer smaller group setting larger group setting
Our team expanded twenty people period plan add
Introverts shine one one setting
Mob Programming group setting
Introverts express better writing
Most Mob interaction take place verbal conversation
Introverts tend avoid limelight
At point everyone Mob center attention
Introverts think talk
Since extrovert talk first think usually setting direction Mob whether right wrong
I find introvert I comfortable driver
Most introvert fond center attention even positive situation
Since I easily fall category designated navigator still somewhat uncomfortable
Often time I correctly diagnose problem spot problem
I like blurt answer stomp another person talking trying figure something
My initial instinct let person work try figure reserve comment absolutely necessary
If I want share idea question usually quieter voice person sitting closest something announced town crier format
My preference navigator research contributing support designated navigator
This present challenge world extrovert thinking often mistaken incompetence lack knowledge
Furthermore group work setting introvert incorrectly labeled social loafer considered disengaged reality almost exact opposite
The issue perceived disengagement also become compounded factor concept recognition
Sometimes I good idea suggestion ignored dismissed overlooked unless I extremely assertive persistent I present
As introvert assertive persistent annoying come naturally
Often time idea presented another team member received open arm great fanfare
In situation frustrating contribution overlooked
There many different characteristic introvert extrovert
These characteristic varying degree compatibility Mob Programming
I believe characteristic make Mob Programming introvert impossible challenging others
As introvert I draw energy introspection thinking
Of course contrary Mob Programming
If definition Mob Programming whole team work thing time place computer Zuill Looking definition alone apparent could introvert worst nightmare
The great thing experience Mob Programming working together always optional
At time I feel need step away recharge I know I without consequence
Sometimes take quick walk around building
I also able get alone time coming early programming lunch
I decided test keeping log group time personal time
It confirmed I suspected weekday core hour spent group environment morning lunch usually spent personal time evening reserved family time
There deviation team lunch evening
I notice time excessive group conflict proposed solution technical direction moment particularly draining
These occasion I found going short walk
I certain introvert harmonizer
Large group seem function corollary alone time
Most Mob Programming experience group five seven people
When working five people I know well experience comfortable
When working five stranger many
Seven people whether I know start cross uncomfort zone
Our team encourages visit outside observer
This usually involves type knowledge exchange single visitor whole team team six people visit mob
A single visitor usually problem
But situation whole team visit u prove draining
We week steady onslaught visitor four five weekday end week I completely
When I become I recover best going Professor Brian Little refers restorative niche Lambert
A restorative niche place action allows return true self
My restorative niche usually involves briefly leaving environment I find exhausting
In work environment always feasible physically move
In situation I find restorative niche sitting back workspace work related research mobile computing device
I try find something requires minimal social interaction like completing expense report maintenance type task require mob
If fails I sometimes resort nuclear option I shut communication channel
This always appropriate work environment either sometimes feel bit immature leaving feeling I tough suck
My nuclear option something I proud definitely area improvement
Introverts prefer one one conversation group activity Helgoe
I would agree come learning work environment I prefer pairing Mob Programming
Furthermore pairing someone equal skill level learning challenging fun learning together working figure something solve problem new
Strong style pairing also great learning mentor protégé relationship well
Mob Programming also great learning sometimes varying level skill maybe gap learner
Stopping Mob ask question always encouraged embraced
I still feel pressure interrupt flow especially roll
Slowing one person learn something seem intrusive slowing full Mob four people
Working one one feel natural I think relates work related task I feel like difference Pairing Mobbing negligible learning I definitely leaning toward Pairing Mobbing
Introverts take time opening people preferring poet Stephen Dunn refers slow disclosure Chung
It take awhile get know people get settled
I spent grade school probably really start feeling comfortable grade
Of course high school weird time anyway coupled fact I introvert make easier
Five year
That long time
Of course I improved since still take awhile get comfortable open
I naturally drawn familiar teammate I known longest
Getting comfortable gradual process I slowly finding content size team warming newer member team
Introverts territorial
This presented challenge introvert work common area boundary personal space often get blurred
I would often come work find thing piled desk mine
I sure happened member team I found particularly annoying
I took declaration rest team space important repository discarding unwanted item
One issue related personal space addressed early Mob Programming lifespan related seating
Once found chair comfortable adjusted personal taste It labeled given special marking indicate specific owner
This work well make apparent chair belongs
There competition good chair little chair someone else sat chair adjusted setting
As new member joined team concept introduced everyone appears adapted
One area room improvement physical space
Everyone individual space space frequently violated I mentioned earlier
Additionally team member specific area tend congregate park space defined specified specific people unwritten rule someone usual space sort space
As added new member communicated existing team member specific area parked relocate due new member inadvertently taking space
We recently moved new building employee locker designated desk space specific people
We five mobbing station fifteen public workstation available individual use pairing
The new space considerably room team spread seems le contention formally informally defined personal space
While I get satisfaction working alone I find much rewarding working group may typical introvert
I believe work introvert thrive familiar
A smaller group people I established strong relationship would first choice team
A large group people I know would last choice
I sometimes try imagine party would like people closest friend I knew well
I think I would enjoy much engagement smaller number people
I would probably feel uncomfortable maybe even little guilty fact I enough time solid conversation attendee
As long I familiarity team member team size overwhelming group work still appeal introvert sensibility
Introverts enjoy draw energy center attention
As Mob Programmer point either driving keyboard navigating driver keyboard role share center attention
Navigating take greater share center attention role I find intimidating introvert
Navigating comfortable front group though
It comfortable knowledgeable topic discussed navigated
Introverts typically best thinking foot
Navigating almost thinking foot especially subject matter direction completely new
Being able competently articulate direction concept group people much taxing front keyboard following someone else direction
Of course people Mob intimidating task navigating
I attempted improve putting center attention situation
I started attending Toastmasters meeting get better public speaking
I also tried outgoing engaging conference
I also trying facilitate session conference possible
Introverts think speak sometimes think really long time sometimes decide speak
I difficulty thinking foot pressure I would rather go something mind time
I one people think snappy comeback five minute conversation sometimes even five day
In Mob Programming culture problematic
Competence often graded verbal action
A silent introvert sometimes incorrectly perceived disengaged actuality heavily engaged inside mind soaking said analyzing Lange
Sometimes mobbing I engaged thinking going waiting turn speak
Sometimes turn speak never happens
Someone else may end verbalizing thought I moment speak pass
A pause think also seen opportunity interrupt especially overzealous extrovert
One frustrating thing introvert interrupted
Occasionally I pause collect thought I finished talking often mistaken completion statement
I learned sometimes I interrupted I keep talking increase volume let teammate know I still expressing thought
This limited Mob Programming situation happen environment
My teammate told look disappointment face cue picked made aware interrupt
This also testament team environment
The closely work group people better get know teammate easier pick subtle nuance personality personal like dislike
Being aware going teammate make easier work together
Becoming absorbed thought idea challenging introvert Mob Programming environment
I see hear something team working I latch
I get lost thought realize minute gone I temporarily lost focus task hand
I know introvert get comfort recharge best thought extrovert get social interaction Burruss
While might able stay engaged side conversation especially people help guide conversation I think might difficult introvert may comfortable mind
Anyone get distracted Mob Programming extrovert prefer loud another person introvert prefer mind alone
Introverts known pick seat close exit bail much need reprieve
Also introvert prefer sit outskirt edge group Myles
This much issue mob
Each member mob chair type indicator let everyone know owner
If move take chair part pick want sit stand
We occasionally update meeting workspace bring large number people
In situation bit cramped I try find way spot perimeter
I big small talk someone asks day I usually suspect extrovert setting segue telling day
This something limited Mob Programming environment
In reality much issue Mob Programming since usually focused task hand
I sensitive negative energy Keighin
Like workplace relationship people occasionally disagreement
If disagreement become long winded I usually become disinterested quickly
When come disagreement solution I would rather move forward long discussion move forward
In situation I usually step away minute maybe go quick walk time I return course action decided moving forward
Because team operates guideline treating kindness consideration respect disagreement relatively uneventful stepping away need break acceptable encouraged
I started working Hunter around May
For first three year Hunter I comfortable cozy little mob five people
From May December mob grew size five twenty presented challenge
Adding one two people year would preferable introvert Hunter major business goal needed accomplished still team needed grow fast accommodate growth meet business need
Trying get comfortable many new people quickly make miserable
I find gravitating toward original team member certain warmth come familiarity I think may appeal introvert extrovert
In one early retrospective team doubled size ten absorbed another team within company extrovert observed clique appeared forming around old team would work
It valid point I suspect introvert felt natural way allowing overlook could harmful integration member team
Any group social circle I belonged always added new member group point
This always bothered mild way
I would prefer keep group I joined
I realized long ago silly selfish group team survive without bringing new blood
Furthermore everyone held view I I ever allowed join new group club social circle
I found since team growing I withdrawn degree perhaps mechanism coping increased stimulation
Some noticed change well
Since I joined Hunter Mob team tasked couple new project
This mean team growing continue grow
This caused change team way work
As introvert I get excited idea adding people anything
Our cozy little team five almost tripled original member split among different team
I still see team member I bonded worked closely year interaction day limited quick hello water cooler day
Initially started running three mob time issue people hopping team team
This left torn
The introvert wanted dedicated team working core group people every day
But learner seen benefit promiscuous pairing group thinking liked idea cross pollination bumble bee team member
We eventually retrospected group came conclusion primary reason people drifting team team due unfounded fear missing something
We initially allowing team member change mob presented different set challenge
This problem ended solving naturally fell comfortable team composition allowed flexibility adjustment needed
I Mob Programmer almost four year
Given choice I would work way
Mob Programming make better developer better tester better leader better person
I exactly sure Mob Programming appeal introvert I idea
Introverts value close friendship fiercely loyal I think drawn Mob Programming
Woody Zuill brought Hunter Industries worked well together past
I consider Woody friend mentor
That friendship served foundation new environment
Woody since moved I slowly getting know newer member Hunter Mob
One team may better worse another team subjective team different
As Richard Dalton said Teams immutable
Every time someone leaf join new team changed team
Dalton I believe I working toward building close friendship newest Mobbers well
They might agree
I believe friendship biggest factor attracts Mob Programming
There many great thing Mob Programming I believe friendship I developed important
Just writing paper I learned quite bit introvert extrovert
I learned sometimes appears loud top extrovert sometimes team member really excited passionate current work
My advice introverted Mob Programmer would open giving receiving feedback
If concern let people know
Not everyone may aware nuance introvert extrovert
Sharing concern article blog introvert extrovert complement work environment helpful everyone team
If introvert new Mob Programming prepared take time get comfortable like done new environment situation entered entire life
If extrovert new team open mind consider one person think unfriendly cold could introvert opened yet
I actually think extrovert team initially make transition introvert new environment easier
I want thank Woody Zuill Chris Lucian Dexter Baga Jason Kerney role mentor Mob Programmers technologist friend
I would like thank entire Hunter Mob especially new people
Thanks Hunter Industries creating awesome environment great thing allowed happen
My family Tina Skylar Alyssa Lauryn encouraging supportive I grateful
I also want express gratitude mom supported long I remember
Finally many thanks Rebecca asking write document providing great insight feedback recognizing thing important I even realize important

FotolEdhar Fotolia new way approaching timeless software development problem improve productivity
When software professional struggle unanswered question missing information dependency get stuck
But one way solve problem may put whole team work problem
Mob programming software development technique entire team work together produce feature
They sit single computer screen often projector take turn keyboard
The technique build involves four six people instead two said Johanna Rothman management consultant Rothman Consulting LLC based Bedford Hills
It similar swarming one key difference In mob programming team remains together duration work
In swarming team collectively decides
But work divvied member work alone Rothman said
Mob programming one person ability deliver
Mob programming hot topic recent
But necessarily next big thing software development
It simple technique way boost productivity way software team stuck get unstuck according Woody Zuill senior consultant coaching training firm Industrial Logic Berkeley Many thing block productivity exist work together one screen said Zuill managed may world first mob programming team
He tagged three issue block productivity software pro The term mob programming bit misnomer
The mobbing technique applies aspect software development process including requirement testing
The instance writing code Rothman said
But product owner part mob programming process
The team might decide example work refining product feature first said
Let mob making smaller
Zuill set invent mob programming anything like
The technique grew belief team work best figure work said
When joined manufacturing firm Hunter Industries based San Marcos software development manager team six began experimenting new way working
One thing engage weekly training practice using code kata technique hone skill
In code kata concept originated Dave Thomas five six people sit screen taking turn keyboard interval
The team liked technique began adapting applying real project training exercise
They kept discovered something really good happening
The team figured get work done said Zuill run website
The term mob programming took hold accident
A mob group people gathered take action said
I used term jest
One team member liked stuck
He take credit coining phrase mob programming
He first encountered book chapter written Laurie Williams professor computer science department North Carolina State University
What interesting mob programming work
The simple reason get feedback right away stakeholder present Rothman said
I work opposed handing
Teams complete work faster
You get small feature done half day maybe even couple hour said
Zuill team Hunter Industries formally measure productivity
But found working mob great deal work getting done said
What management told developing good software
There profound reason mob programming produce good software
There thinking going Zuill said
Before idea get someone head computer go someone else hand
That force everyone think carefully work hoping said
Although mob programming set rule Zuill recommends guiding principle The mob programming approach new relatively software pro experimented
Not surprisingly skeptical
There also problem technically difficult I need maximum concentration keep everything straight implementing debugging
Having group programmer surrounding seems distracting end posted Dutch Gun June discussion called Mob Programming Huh
technology website
Dutch Gun also noted mob programming approach might help situation
You essentially programming constant design I see quality code would improve
Others dismissive
The people group care idea pas le care getting stuff done wrote Anonymous Coward posting thread
Writing June thread titled Hypersupervised Programming
poster identified said mob programming approach could work aspect development process
In job equivalent programming start project implementing something interesting complex framework component intended reused developer
The time far efficient sit desk headphone bang code integrated appropriate interval
Rothman said mob programming everyone one need experiment unless want
I would never impose said
There rule mob
It one tool toolbox
But software team trouble getting thing done important try something new
Maybe could help little mobbing said

Most work done sitting together group work area
We try make comfortable possible
There plenty room easily others join u whenever needed
Our work area configured standard cubicle wall x
It work pretty nicely although earlier worked separate room found even better
There one computer use programming
We also computer sitting around use mobbing researching looking database writing email etc
parallel programming
There often one person searching information problem new technology trying use
We stay together communicate continually learning
There two projector use dual monitor
We project onto wall painted matte white paint work well purpose
After experimenting height distance brightness setting found basic setup work nicely everyone
The projector model pretty high quality
There two keyboard two mouse everyone choice work
We experimented several different keyboard settled two different setup regular one natural one
Hand sanitizer always available
We use chair move around take different role Driver Navigator
This way need constantly readjust chair
Our chair good quality
Our work surface couple table comfortable sit
We put computer projector phone speaker thing table
We also rolling magnetic whiteboard use keeping track work well whiteboards easel couple file cabinet desk height
We follow style work I originally learned Llewellyn Falco pair programming technique
Llewellyn approach different I shown seen read I think invented evolved
In pattern Navigator thinking direction want go verbally describes discus next step code must
The Driver translating spoken English code
In word code written go brain mouth Navigator ear hand Driver computer
If make sense probably try video complete description sometime soon
In use pattern one Driver rest team join Navigators Researchers
One important benefit communicating discussing design everyone team
Everyone stay involved informed
The main work Navigators thinking describing discussing steering
The coding done Driver simply mechanic getting actual code computer
The Driver also often involved discussion main job translate idea code
Of course great writing code important useful well knowing language IDE tool etc
real work software development problem solving typing
If Driver highly skilled rest team help guiding Driver create code often suggest thing like keyboard language feature Clean Code practice etc
This learning opportunity Driver transfer knowledge quickly througout team quickly improves everyones coding skill
We rotate Driver every minute
Using list working rotate list every minute current Driver move away keyboard join Navigators next person list move keyboard start typing

Golly
How suppose writing code rest team effectively simultaneous code review magically produce fewer feature better code quality everybody writing code throwing together cursory bit code review end
Next telling one two tester per developer produce software spending money developer get feature
You make good point
If way get code review done though something terribly wrong world
Most social interaction innovation thought people understand people like left alone work better way
While I one like left alone working I feel competent code review important part development process
Too bad many previous employer either think I ca review code chatting looking someone shoulder
Nor I concentrate programming people looking shoulder
I need left alone program I accomplished something I discus people
In experience rare people much tune effectively work group time introvert like probably work I ca think talk co We Eric There used u I old school write code although may reviewed others later
A question either pair programming mob programming keep punching fucking face
They
That nobody pair programming real world
You might hey look work together minute twice month
You ask question bad thing
I guessing work solving sort problem fairly well
But problem I run require silent contemplation quite bit time come solution
I hard time envisioning working pair programming I done brief amount mob programming never tried probably like
There also problem technically difficult I need maximum concentration keep everything straight implementing debugging
Having group programmer surrounding seems distracting end
I could see might help situation essentially programming constant design review meeting I see quality code would improve
You unlikely simply accept solution got couple programmer readily suggest solution thought yet
The fact improves quality productivity really come surprise essentially multiplying focused single problem five programmer ca necessarily solve problem five time faster
An interesting concept
I think I want program way pair programming I could see helpful time
At moment I either work project remote contract programmer I largely position solve everything often fairly difficult immediate access programmer advice assistance
When I hear style like I always think network modern computer linked together Ethernet LAN
Whatever benefit additional CPU cycle might add taken away low throughput high latency communication medium
What average throughput spoken conversation anyway
Maybe baud good day
Keep mind human being pretty good creating shared mental context conversation programmer would also lot shared knowledge problem hand well generalized knowledge programmer know
For instance I said We use proxy object create streamlined interface minimize coupling various system much information convey
If programmer probably said quite bit word understand deeper meaning behind word
I guess consider shared knowledge highly effective form compression information spoken communication part remember
For instance I said We use proxy object create streamlined interface minimize coupling various system much information convey
If programmer probably said quite bit word understand deeper meaning behind word
Been programming long time
That sentence useless
Its meaningless speech direct manager know
That may meaning people involved project exact page pretty much case never
Keep mind even though slashdot rediscovered practice done universally suck
This nothing rediscovered fad people ca actually code think Keep mind human being pretty good creating shared mental context conversation You also assume certain amount standard knowledge understanding among peer order shared mental context
Depending I talking I may need dumb vocabulary complexity idea
If I toss phrase scalable lockless datastructure going WHOOSH people I talk
Now I need spend several day trying get someone speed concept probably wo fully understand lot I talk Well respect bandwidth user computer keyboard
If primary purpose communication implementation thousand tool best equal meeting room whiteboard
They trying mash traditional system agree build go build time
To smell like jack trade king none need deal everything hig What average throughput spoken conversation anyway
Maybe baud good day
baud actually pretty accurate guestimation
baud way slower reading speed
baud point certain case say transferring ascii text file pretty much equal slightly faster reading speed balanced relatively slower ANSI box character added mix ANSI color code took byte send
baud point thing beyond reading speed large enough amount baud frustration di You unlikely simply accept solution got couple programmer readily suggest solution thought yet
Absolutely wrong
If right design comittee would synonym utterly fucked
And bigger group likely pick something get fight
Absolutely wrong
If right design comittee would synonym utterly fucked
Point comittee good reaching place comitees necessarily good problem hand
In word designed comittee synonym uttelry fucked never happens one solve problem comittes manager
Imagine world solver instead manager comittee
No design committee fails matter good people job increase number people involved difference opinion politics magnify
Design committee fails even best brightest committee
So break coding element create sound logically structure
You want coder churning code want break coding application final result task required achieve successful outcome
So code researcher gather information problem solved define layout problem
Next code describers describe problem coding term break problem various coding element
Then coder The people group care idea pas le care getting shit done
If putting bunch people together good idea Congress would exist
comittee comitees comittes Perhaps form decide spelling use sake consistency
Design committee often fails experience group equal committee one empowered make final decision willing make final decision need made
In sort programming environment I think would critical least one person authority make final decision matter disagreement contention likely senior programmer come technical issue owner better avg coder cheaper avg one blow away cost much get poor work overall v say good coder
turn process
It bad enough needed peer review log statement need programmer watching type
Has code become complex one brain ca handle one statement
It time refactoring
This seems like another fad day approach
All new method strike coming either manager expert little actual experience keyboard writing actual code university professor theorist whose code written slave labor form grad student
We converging infinite monkey
Code quality awesome
You forgot salesman probably biggest block promoter fad
Seriously I still waiting company realizes private office plus collaborative space know old school office best way go
You need quiet concentrate tricky problem
You
You need get together team work something
You room actual door train people use proper conversational cell phone loud tone boom productivity
Not chaos mimic appearance creative work actual work
Seriousl Seriously hire developer six figure give hundred buck desk space even four cube wall
I wondered
Beyond noise distraction close personal hygiene becomes distraction
Hard concentrate smell neighbor shower week
Different people well different environment
I everyone office
It sucked
Complete lack human interaction work friendship high bar actual collaboration
I found depressing environment
I work open environment
Once long I trouble concentrating due noise
But loss productivity absolutely crushed gain due able talk people
And crushed increased productivity I due Seriously hire developer six figure give hundred buck desk space even four cube wall
That make sense world right
Argh
That goal productive remind pleb place
Offices reserved higher organisation require office
It class system designed remind cattle
The occasional loyal worker course argue better collaboration exchange idea etc consider important enough organisation one day get office Seriously I still waiting company realizes private office plus collaborative space know old school office best way go
Well I waiting since hold breath
Fortunately company I currently work instituted home policy employee lived long way away
I decreed long way basically stopped showing
If ever object I immediately quit I literally feel blood pressure rising I sit open plan office got point life health important career
Fuck
Open
Plan
Of Seriously hire developer six figure give hundred buck desk space even four cube wall
That make sense world right
Argh
They fixing
Their getting rid programmer replacing programmer India
Then balance cubicle space programmer restored
Yeah good idea
Sure team member mediocre noobs may work dealing alpha coder invariably lead open argument people tearing huff
Pair programming work pair collaborates get along compatible way communicating verbally
Taking higher extreme usually result chaos
Hit high point I think
Have tried mob stuff either hope I never would handy workstation around anyone personal quick learning session
Seems team could easily think
Rather formal scheduling group work put together VM sandbox kiosk common stuff mode snapshot couple time day steam A manager went Master Programmer showed requirement document new application
The manager asked Master How long take design system I assign five programmer
It take one year said Master promptly
But need system immediately even sooner
How long take I assign ten programmer
The Master Programmer frowned
In case take two year
And I assign hundred programmer
The Master Programmer shrugged
Then design never completed said
If ca quantify something readily quantifiable probably matter much PHB might wish true
With five people interrupting trying get idea heard likely mean none putting anything past cursory amount thought work
I easily believe group like would actually le productive single person coding alone
Really answer
Competence
Are many fad intended substitute basic coding competence sadly I found rarer might wish
And ultimately fad fail order produce good product competence ca eliminated matter
But big downside truly competent staff forced get bogged management dictated ca produce look nearly bad everyone el There problem mob gang lynch anyone part mob
This happen western
It happening since dawn time natural property crowd least able thinker one likely swayed
And one strongest argument Outsider danger group kill effective survival
life certain threshold intelligence
The combination two aspect There problem mob gang lynch anyone part mob
Democracy often feel way
It necessarily true first meeting even feel later true
Saying always happens realistic
You may noticed mention push quickly repository article mentioned developer trying merge week work That problem
If merge quickly merging usually painless
If everyone save week work merging get really painful
This happen detail nailed
If ever find project detail nailed one field spend lot money verification like NASA I sure could charge programmer admission go see amazement
However I practice different form

All programming compiling testing debugging happens one system

Everyone log system I remain local system start voice conference

Everyone able write code sling straight I immediately compile test everyone get see result hear experience software run
I currently working little version SecondLife
Pair programming suck
Mob moved u fro How could possible better using git sane version history
For starter really good collaboration
Someone could writing code someone else notice fucked indentation syntax fix fly explaining going
And possible advantage everyone logging one system local Most devs country
Waiting everyone thing submit dig shit see I going say I make sense
I parroting personal experience managing coding various project
It make sense afraid admit wrong encountered problem I speak
I thank praise however
It rare I see MOB programming get credit sort
Nancy working several year suggested Mob Programming one way mature technical lead faster If skilled architect year experience nothing see
Unless need grow new one
Looks like put government construction worker charge programming team
Pair extreme programming fun one guy work two take credit
Mob programming promise even fun
Really
Did controlled study
How factor complexity problem domain experience developer efficiency tool etc
Or another buzz word compliant worked marketing gimmick
Does scale based project team size
What global project team may Europe America Asia
How control factor
Sorry sound like crap
Pair programming crap idea never work
The better programmer get held back frustrated programmer incompetence worse programmer stay depth
What ever get mediocre piece work best since better programmer usually compromise sake worse programmer
Thank thank I week
Tip waitor try fish
In experience biggest problem software development people developer PMs stake holder etc
talking one another
And talking next concrete step solution problem
Anything mitigates problem good thing
Wether pair programming Scrum formalised ritual talking one another mob programming stuff
The problem method always keep mind using To solve problem mentioned
Forget Okay I actually mean typing headline short explain
We least one maybe two people group actually produce fairly decent solution l w ad hoc work
For example meeting discussing something I whip query minute answer take back office meeting work ten minute find
He slow typing
He poor using
He constantly need reference documentation diagram
The thing though produce solution actually good work well unlike others either make weird design causing grief road buggy code leading fire fighting
If I asked manager I like let go would near top list
But I sit fiddling thumb worked I probably ready quit le week
I guessing pair programming hand keyboard mob programming I sure enforced round robin system one holding keyboard dominating
Why description Mob Programming remind
Maybe investigate problem code merges first
Having everyone bunch front one editor seems like workaround get root cause problem
If use reasonably loose coupling software component define interface component start writing one one programmer work component merges problem merges someone make mistake
mob programming better merging
hard since merging far worst part programming company
The solution course I implemented programming company decade ago build platform require merging first place
The benefit programming everyone know going everyone see happen
Nothing
Every month get story brand new development paradigm arrangement coder
That new thing Mob Programming Angular usually shown work great specific problem set programmer architect I always wary panacea solution propose best way regardless problem
It like ancient philosophical conundrum defining happiness different different people
name Nuke anonymous coward Had anon child
Sorry occasionally post something value without account
I sure setting control user option dead obvious I could arsed look since layout simple checkboxes hideously mangled
Also I could possibly care le correct JavaScript YMMV expect reply etc
Enjoy
Nice
Here quick dirty script I made fix XX comment Slashdot moved way balloon
Well topic stand counterpoint mob programming
probably caused problem first place
Getting rapped buch programmer worst experience ever
Yeah
Hah nice Pomona Google Maps say bar Louis
From experience single programming quality interact way go
Once started scrum progress slammed halt last big company I worked
I idea blame programmer excel spreadsheet failure timelined project manager
If I lazy I would love one person keyboard happily chirp rest crowd process variable

Now write buzzword filled book make process bam got next Agile
In seriousness sound like wonderful experiment I bet highly dependent team composition
I would think lot good programmer would drowned setting
Here crux typing bottleneck software development writing code building product
The real cost solving problem waste rework
This one insightful thing I ever heard team work software development area
As I would say bottleneck typing many case ability test hypothesis
This combination exploring code find evidence typing potential fix code diagnose problem stepping debugger looking captured packet waiting build etc
Typing code bottleneck writing code
The bottleneck ability get truth happening
The computer best friend mob programmer
The mob would helpful generating hypothesis little verify without computer
Most time I come diagnosis problem solution enough reasoning system verifying reasoning sound
There little time computer idle
In case I get really stumped usually every idea I failed
Until point mob useless
Unfortunately I arrived point cost bringing mob speed problem hand prohibitive
So I remain stuck I unstick
little verify without computer
Agreed
So computer readily available order parallelize small experiment read documentation google etc
Unfortunately I arrived point cost bringing mob speed problem hand prohibitive
Yes cost individual found net gain team
Also one biggest blocker transition code review
I much happier I wait team member review contribution
typing symbol
The disconnect state machine model developer mind actual manifestation great
But people see actual ca see underpinnings behind
tldr People see bridge bridge construction see essential architectural decision
Blocked ublock origin deleted I think mean linearly
The cost increase linear manner add developer
The question get linear reduction time solve problem
I tend agree I believe value outweigh cost general
I hoping blogpost Sounds awful
This mean entire mob collectively work single problem time mean debugging testing single issue stop development work entire mob
Worst mean big project ca developer specialize experience subsystem module big project
It mean ca distribute development subsystem multiple different developer development team time
typing bottleneck entire team pay attention exact thing time would
Sounds like decent exercise awful actual development process
I agree probably scale certain threshold
See experiment find optimal value special case called However I disagree bit debugging testing single issue stop development work simply debugging testing part development
It admittedly unvalidated perception quality code actually wrote exceptionally high group effort
Very seldomly ever encounter bug could fix quickly using collective understanding idea
What become bottleneck whenever grunt work
For case split person mob performs specific task
What net productivity decrease
Do metric like story point resolved ticket
That elephant room article
I one team member AMA I agree hard number would helpful
Unfortunately switch mob programming done time also changing process type work done reliable metric hard get
What I say switch hard time getting done completion
Now I feel much confident ability deliver
With said approaching point feel work thing parallell switching mob workflow
All awesome learning experience u well worth experimenting reason break bad habit

In syntactic unit express action carried
A program written language formed sequence one statement
A statement may internal component
Many imperative language
make distinction statement definition statement containing executable code definition instantiating expression evaluates value
A distinction also made simple compound statement latter may contain statement component
The following major generic kind statement pseudocoded
These pseudocoded statement immediate corresponding syntax typical imperative language like Pascal C Fortran etc
The appearance statement shape look program
Programming language characterized type statement use
family
Many statement introduced like
Often statement reserved used name
Imperative language typically use special syntax statement look quite different function call
Common method describe syntax statement
Semantically many statement differ call handling
Usually actual subroutine parameter evaluated subroutine called
This contrast many statement parameter evaluated several time
condition
loop body loop
Technically statement parameter parameter
parameter evaluated needed see also
When parameter available statement like behaviour implemented subroutine see
For language without parameter semantic description usually beyond capability language
Therefore standard document often refer semantic description natural language
In language statement contrast statement return result executed solely expression always return result often side effect
Among imperative programming language one statement return result
In language mix imperative style family distinction expression statement made even expression executed sequential context solely side effect whose return value used considered
In statement everything expression
This distinction frequently observed wording statement expression
This found function found language Python found applied statement applied expression
Most language fixed set statement defined language experiment allow programmer define new statement

learn share knowledge build career
What statement
Algorithm determines number statement number operation executed Computer Organization Design A line code something
mean I guess
Whatever called statement programming language
Often statement translates compilation dozen machine instruction
For example statement may include function call translates call instruction computation argument instruction push pop argument call depending calling convention

I appointed Team Leader within year today I independently look enhancement maintenance three module sixteen Project ART
During work project ART MBT interaction colleague I grown admire role Computer Networks empowering
I directly involved Computer Networks job avid reading periodical journal like World I sustained interest field
In fact reading immense potential protocol application like Over Private Networks I help feel excited potential new research area
While present job helped develop thorough insight project handling industry environment I currently support desire research
I posse skill Computers I must build achieve goal undertaking research advanced computing specific reference Computer Networks
I therefore believe I must return academic world growth
I wish earn MS degree Computer Science
I intend follow later career research teaching
I spoken professor senior colleague choice University applied Princeton University reputable research facility computing resource
The department web site revealed strong faculty involved extensive research area Computer Networks
This strengthened resolve study Princeton University
I bring along strong grasp fundamental Electronics Computers aptitude teaching team work zest challenge enthusiastic desire learn I

Testing important activity checking correctness system implementation
We need find bug system unit level well integration system level testing
At unit level use white box testing approach find bug developed code whereas integration system level use black box testing approach validate system functionality
In paper focus two widely used black box white box approach software testing
We compare various feature approach find approach useful different stage testing find bug software
Software testing important component software engineering field important technique improving software quality
There two main technique software testing white box testing black box testing
Black box testing deal functionality system based software requirement
Black box testing performed user perspective giving input data getting valid output
White box testing concerned inner design structure system
White box testing helpful find bug software initial level testing
A couple paper describe black box white box testing technique highlighting different feature technique
These paper also tell advantage disadvantage approach explained stage approach used
The paper also mentioned testing cost tester skill testing type
In paper look detail black box white box testing
We highlight main technique different feature approach
Based feature take comparison technique analyze technique feasible testing certain stage software testing
As white box testing used unit level black box testing used integration system level testing
So using white box black box testing sufficient find bug software
Both approach importance testing software finding bug different level software testing
This paper organized follows
Section paper describes black box testing method detail
Section includes detail white box testing approach used test software project
Section describes comparison testing approach white box black box testing
Section concludes paper
Black box testing treat system explicitly use Knowledge internal structure code
Therefore black box testing performed giving input getting expected output
Black box testing verifies correctness software behaviour referred behaviour coverage
The focus black box testing functionality system
Black box testing requirement includes software requirement us case executable program data
These requirement usually met middle phase development lifecycle large piece code begin operate together
Black box testing performed source code
As programming completes packaged larger component code
This package built compiling linking binding executable code demonstrate collective code execution behaviour input output
Here Black box testing diagram
Diagram Black box Testing Developers usually focus positive testing validating expected behaviour code
Tester add value black box testing executing positive negative testing tester know defect found unexpected behaviour
Here technique Black box testing
Equivalence class technique In technique software data divided partition data test case derived
This technique ensures test case derived cover partitioned data
According method one test case enough partition check behaviour program
By using equivalence class technique test case reduced test case partition find new fault program
The recommended black box approach selecting equivalence class value includes value beginning middle end data range
We understand technique help example
Let u assume security system validate log IDs production
Now tester validate logon IDs hand tester know three category IDs clerk supervisor manager
Now sample category sufficient validation
Let u consider logon IDs category
During validation logon IDs given category accepted increase sample size logon ID category continue testing
If initial sample IDs three category correctly accepted tester achieved desired test result using possible test data
Boundary Value Analysis technique In technique analysis extended beginning ending input value possibility equivalence class
The boundary value around beginning ending portion functional error input output data occurs around boundary
The boundary analysis begin identifying smallest value increment specific equivalence class
This increment smallest value called boundary value epsilon
It used calculate value around beginning ending value equivalence class
If take example boundary value category would value equivalence value
Equivalence class remain smaller even addition boundary test value
Expected result coverage Technique The expected result coverage technique focus output test value related input value
To get expected result need find business rule application requirement
The difference expected result actual result combination input cause analysis determine difference faulty test design unclear ambiguous rule program error
Error Guessing In technique Tester judge bug error hidden
Tester test application past experience creates test case validate different task
There specific tool used technique
Advantages Black Box testing Here advantage black box testing Ease Use Black Box testing involved inner functionality application easy tester create test case simple working application
Black box tester need high skill programming rather low skilled person black box testing
Quicker Test Case Development Test case developed quickly tester concern user interface
There need identify internal path may involves specific process
The tester cover UI path user may take make quicker test development
Simplicity Using black box testing even complex application tested focus valid invalid input ensuring correct put received
Issues Black box testing The Followings issue black box testing approach
Fragility User interface interaction make script fragile
The reason UI may rendered constantly time time different platform
Unless tool capable dealing difference UI rendering likely test case fail execute properly
Lack introspection One drawback black box testing look inner logic application unlike white box testing
Therefore black box testing never test application fully
Failure reason Another issue black box testing found reason failure
It tell cause failure system
So pure black box testing guarantee coverage tested component
The white box testing involves inner logic program test case constructed source code program
It based knowledge system implemented
White box testing includes analysis data flow control flow information flow coding practice exception error handling within system test intended unintended behaviour system
White box testing requires access source code
When code developed white box testing performed time life cycle good practice perform white box testing unit level testing
The first step white box testing analyze available design documentation source code knowing make software secure fundamental requirement
Second create test exploit software
Third thing perform testing effectively tester need know technique tool used white box testing
White box testing normally developer extension code debugging activity
The developer usually focus making code work give tendency debug code know work
Software tester add value developer debugging activity helping developer plan debug code usual
The logic test coverage attain debugging fewer defect discovered later kind testing
The earlier defect discovered le expensive correct
Research yet produced white box approach guarantee logic test coverage situation
Here diagram white box testing
Static Analysis Manual Automated Inspection Walkthrough Symbolic Execution Static Verification Diagram White Box Testing White box testing verifies correctness software statement code path condition loop data flow
The prerequisite white box testing include software requirement use case executable program data source code
Here technique used white box testing
Statement Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code line program executed
If line source code program determine manually tool executed line source code achieved statement coverage
A hypothesis context higher source code test coverage fewer defect found later
The practical conclusion new unexecuted code line software time bomb waiting explode inopportune moment production
The question explode question
Branch coverage technique This technique focus determining percentage source code branch logic program executed
Suppose source code branch point program determine manually tool executed branch counting true false branch execution separately achieved branch point coverage
The unexecuted branch unexecuted statement found often untested error recovery logic
Testing simple condition branch compound condition branch requires fewer initial test action
The developer need choose test value force true branch test value force false branch two test value per branch
Compound Condition Coverage Technique This technique extends branch coverage technique branch compound condition one contain combination Boolean operator AND OR NOT along pair parenthesis possible nested
In technique challenge identify test value combination evaluate true false every simple condition every Boolean combination simple condition
Path Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code path program traversed completely
A source code path sequence program statement first executable statement series arithmetic replacement branch looping statement statement
If different path program determine manually tool executed achieved path coverage
The underlying hypothesis higher path test coverage fewer defect found later
Loop Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code loop program cycled completely
In programming language several loop like DO FOR WHILE UNTIL
Some loop clever construct IF statement subsequent return IF statement
The objective loop testing force program loop zero time one time time n terminal loop value n time time
The loop loop loop validate expected loop response beginning middle end longest loop
The time loop test unexpected inappropriate looping condition
Here list common advantage white box testing
Introspection Introspection ability look inside application tester identify object programmatically
It helpful UI change frequently UI yet known It allows testing proceed
In situation decrease fragility test script provided name object change
Stability White box testing delivers greater stability reusability test case object include application never change
Thoroughness White box testing helpful technique essential know every path thoroughly tested every possible internal interaction examined
This technique give tester ability thorough term much application test
The issue white box testing listed Complexity The tester must detailed programmatic knowledge application order test white box testing technique
White box testing involves internal logic application code complexity requires highly skilled tester develop test case
Fragility Although introspection overcomes issue application change breaking test script reality often name object change product development
White box testing requires test script tightly tied underlying code application mean change code often cause white box test script break
Then introduces high degree script maintenance testing process
Integration Due highly integrated nature white box testing tool many provide support one platform usually window
In company company application run platform either need use different tool need test manually
Black box testing based requirement therefore also called behavioral functional testing technique whereas white box testing based internal logic structure project therefore also called structural testing
Black box testing creates test data without aspect software structure technique consider test object implemented requirement
On hand white box testing test derived structure tested object test based actual implementation
Black box testing methodology used integration level system level need look source code need execute system using input data output result
On hand white box testing used logical analytic test unit test level
Black box tester le technical programming bond code tester perception simple white box tester need programming skill identify test path software
In black box testing test case designed soon functional specification complete whereas white box testing test designed program code developed
Black box tester used verify contradiction actual system specification whereas white box tester chooses test case input exercise path code determines appropriate output
It reveals error hidden code
Black box testing focus result user experience whereas white box testing focus internal working making sure application work efficiently possible
White box testing time consuming especially applied whole system directly identifies bug software
In black box testing input need large sample space find expected result
There bug found using black box white box testing
In black box difficult identify possible input limited testing time writing test case slow difficult
In white box testing possible test every path loop program exhaustive testing impossible large system
In black box testing code may reachable without extraordinary measure whereas white box testing tell functionality implemented program
The comprehensive test coverage may achieved black box white box testing technique combined methodology include various benefit application testing
As discussed Black box testing validates functionality software ensures system working correctly according user requirement
Black box testing le expensive compare white box testing performed le technical individual Black box approach cover comprehensive testing system
On hand White box testing check internal structure inner loop condition logic code verify working code
White box testing expensive performed skilled technical individual software size getting huge difficult check part source code integration system level testing
As testing method pro con applied certain level testing
So using one testing approach guarantee bug free software
In conclusion say comprehensive testing system may achieved using technique software testing
White box testing used black box testing improve overall test effectiveness

In context Computer Science use program black box mean use relation executing program chosen input without examining actual code representation sequence symbol program
Using program black box popular Computer Science understanding property program code notoriously hard problem
In talk I survey result regarding use program cryptography
Somewhat surprisingly turn case looking code program actually help
On positive side I present new cryptographic scheme zero knowledge proof system obtainable using technique
Such scheme previously proven obtainable using technique hence conjectured exist
I also briefly survey positive application technique
I also demonstrate power non black box technique negative result namely impossibility result task scrambling obfuscating software
The Trustees Princeton University


performing task chunked together given name
Chunking allows deal potentially complicated task single concept
Instead worrying many many step computer might go though perform task need remember name subroutine
Whenever want program perform task call subroutine
Subroutines major tool dealing complexity
A subroutine sometimes said black box ca see inside precise usually see inside would deal complexity subroutine meant hide
Of course black box way interacting rest world would pretty useless
A black box need kind rest world allows interaction inside box outside
A physical black box might button outside push dial set slot used passing information back forth
Since trying hide complexity create first rule black box Are example black box real world
Yes fact surrounded
Your television car mobile phone refrigerator You turn television change channel set volume using element television interface dial remote control forget plug power without understanding anything thing actually work
The go mobile phone although interface case lot complicated
Now black box inside code subroutine actually performs task electronics inside television set
The inside black box called
The second rule black box In fact possible implementation long behavior box seen outside remains unchanged
For example inside TV set went using vacuum tube using transistor user set need know even know mean
Similarly possible rewrite inside subroutine use efficient code example without affecting program use subroutine
Of course black box someone must designed built implementation first place
The black box idea work advantage implementor well user black box
After black box might used unlimited number different situation
The implementor black box need know
The implementor need make sure box performs assigned task interface correctly rest world
This third rule black box In way black box divide world two part inside implementation outside
The interface boundary connecting two part
By way think interface physical connection box rest world
The interface also includes box controlled using element physical interface
It enough say TV set power switch need specify power switch used turn TV
To put computer science term interface subroutine semantic well syntactic component
The syntactic part interface tell type order call subroutine
The semantic component specifies exactly task subroutine accomplish
To write legal program need know syntactic specification subroutine
To understand purpose subroutine use effectively need know subroutine semantic specification
I refer part interface syntactic semantic collectively subroutine
The contract subroutine say essentially Here use I guaranteed
When write subroutine comment write subroutine make contract clear
I admit practice subroutine contract often inadequately specified much regret annoyance programmer use
For rest chapter I turn general idea black box subroutine general specific writing using subroutine Java
But keep general idea principle mind
They reason subroutine exist first place guideline using
This especially clear I discus subroutine tool program development
You keep mind subroutine example black box programming
For example class also black box
We see class public part representing interface private part entirely inside hidden implementation
All principle black box apply class well subroutine

If wa establish plane crashed need retrieve black box
This virtually indestructible orange device record relevant flight data conversation cockpit
For specialist German Federal Bureau Aircraft Accident Investigation BFU Braunschweig evaluating data recorded black box routine
I think receive something like every week said Jens Friedemann spokesman BFU
But evaluation also incident spectacular serious incident
And serious incident Friedemann mean event flight narrowly averted disaster
Essentially black box flight recorder heavily protected recording device similar hard disk memory card
The black box record relevant flight data addition conversation cockpit
Previously data recorded two different device
But today also unit
According regulation however every airplane must two device board
A black box must able withstand many accident scenario without sustaining damage
Before put use tested see withstand impact concrete wall kilometer per hour static load ton least five minute maximum temperature degree Celsius Fahrenheit one hour water pressure found depth meter foot
In order easier find sea device send signal contact salt water picked within radius two kilometer mile
At short range location wreck already le pinpointed order find device
The voice recorder log sound cockpit including private conversation The voice recorder log sound cockpit
In addition discussion pilot also record automatic computer announcement radio traffic discussion crew announcement passenger
The sound switch engine also recorded device
Private conversation pilot also stored black box captured audio file must handled carefully data protection point view
Discussions evaluated order clarify accident malfunction
For reason recording overwritten maximum minute older device record minute
Technically even possible pilot stop delete recording
In practice however BFU Friedemann said pilot make use feature
But come flight recorder second component black box pilot able directly access stored file
In older aircraft need switch device flight modern aircraft automatic
Black box must withstand pressure depth meter The amount data collected increased significantly recent year
Today hundred sometimes thousand parameter recorded say Friedemann
This includes information thing like flight path altitude aircraft location speed temperature engine exhaust well flap position among many others
The data help expert investigate cause accident serious incident reduce potential source error
However investigator fully reconstruct flight
We use flight simulator animation able get information parameter said Friedemann
There specialized agency worldwide capable evaluating black box every agency able examine various model
The BFU evaluate Western Russian device
But model expert Braunschweig must turn foreign lab help data
In future Friedemann belief video device record certain display cockpit transmission power locator signal water improved
Incidentally black box never actually black
The color predetermined bright orange

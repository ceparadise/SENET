modification software product delivery correct fault improve performance attribute
A common perception maintenance merely involves fixing
However one study indicated maintenance effort used action
This perception perpetuated user submitting problem report reality functionality enhancement system
More recent study put proportion closer
Software maintenance system first addressed
Over period twenty year research led formulation Lehman
Key finding research include maintenance really evolutionary development maintenance decision aided understanding happens system software time
Lehman demonstrated system continue evolve time
As evolve grow complex unless action taken reduce complexity
In late famous widely cited survey study Lientz Swanson exposed high fraction expended maintenance
They categorized maintenance activity four class The survey showed around maintenance effort first two type error correction consumed
Many subsequent study suggest similar magnitude problem
Studies show contribution end user crucial new requirement data gathering analysis
And main cause problem software evolution maintenance
So software maintenance important consumes large part overall lifecycle cost also inability change software quickly reliably mean business opportunity lost
An integral part software maintenance one requires accurate maintenance plan prepared software development
It specify user request modification report problem
The budget include resource cost estimate
A new decision addressed developing every new system feature quality objective
The software maintenance last year even decade development process call effective plan address scope software maintenance tailoring post process designation provide maintenance estimate cost
The selection proper enforcement standard challenging task right early stage software engineering got definite importance concerned stakeholder
This section describes six software maintenance process There number process activity practice unique maintainer example
Swanson initially identified three category maintenance corrective adaptive perfective
The standard superseded June
These since updated present There also notion maintenance good thing lower total cost ownership software
Things like compliance coding standard includes software maintainability goal
The management coupling cohesion software
The attainment software supportability goal SAE example
Note also academic institution carrying research quantify cost ongoing software maintenance due lack resource design document comprehension training resource multiply cost approx
design data available
Impact key adjustment factor maintenance sorted order maximum positive impact Not module troublesome many factor degrade performance
For example complex spaghetti code quite difficult maintain safely
A common situation often degrades performance lack suitable maintenance tool defect tracking software change management software test library software
Below describe factor range impact software maintenance
Impact key adjustment factor maintenance sorted order maximum negative impact

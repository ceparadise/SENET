learn share knowledge build career
I recently started course data compression university
However I find use term entropy applies computer science rather ambiguous
As far I tell roughly translates randomness system structure
What proper definition computer science entropy
Entropy mean different thing In computing entropy randomness collected operating system application use cryptography us require random data
This randomness often collected hardware source either one mouse movement specially provided randomness generator
In information theory entropy measure uncertainty associated random variable
The term context usually refers Shannon entropy quantifies sense expected value information contained message usually unit bit
Equivalently Shannon entropy measure average information content one missing one know value random variable Entropy data compression may denote randomness data inputing compression algorithm
The entropy lesser compression ratio
That mean random text lesser compress
Shannon entropy represents absolute limit best possible lossless compression communication treating message encoded sequence independent random variable Shannon source coding theorem show limit average length shortest possible representation encode message given alphabet entropy divided logarithm number symbol target alphabet
My favorite definition practical focus found Chapter excellent book Andrew Hunt David Thomas While software development immune almost physical law entropy hit u hard
Entropy term physic refers amount disorder system
Unfortunately law thermodynamics guarantee entropy universe tends toward maximum
When disorder increase software programmer call software rot
There many factor contribute software rot
The important one seems psychology culture work project
Even team one project psychology delicate thing
Despite best laid plan best people project still experience ruin decay lifetime
Yet project despite enormous difficulty constant setback successfully fight tendency toward disorder manage come pretty well
One broken window left unrepaired substantial length time instills inhabitant building sense sense power care building
So another window get broken
People start littering
Graffiti appears
Serious structural damage begin
In relatively short space time building becomes damaged beyond owner desire fix sense abandonment becomes reality
The Broken Window Theory inspired police department New York major city crack small stuff order keep big stuff
It work keeping top broken window graffiti small infraction reduced serious crime level
Tip Do Live Broken Windows Do leave broken window bad design wrong decision poor code unrepaired
Fix one soon discovered
If insufficient time fix properly board
Perhaps comment offending code display Not Implemented message substitute dummy data instead
Take action prevent damage show top situation
Text taken I always encountered entropy sense Shannon Entropy
From In information theory entropy measure uncertainty associated random variable
The term context usually refers Shannon entropy quantifies sense expected value information contained message usually unit bit
Equivalently Shannon entropy measure average information content one missing one know value random variable
The information theoretic notion Entropy generalization physical notion
There many way describe Entropy
It measure randomness random variable
It also measure amount information random variable stochastic process contains
It also lower bound amount message compressed
And finally average number question need asked random entity determine value
Equation Entropy sample application probability calculation sum value rv probability value time log prob
p x logp x
This equation derived first principle property information
In term compression information theory entropy source average amount information bit symbol source convey
Informally speaking unlikely symbol surprise appearance brings
If source two symbol say equally likely symbol conveys amount information one bit
A source four equally likely symbol conveys two bit per symbol
For interesting example source three symbol first two twice likely third third surprising also le likely
There net entropy source calculated
You calculate entropy average surprise surprise symbol probability time negative binary log probability The negative binary log used course log value exclusive negative
The word entropy defined one sentence Imagine example expansion universe From beginning matter collected small point big bang could described system matter within one point
While today significantly information required describe system Universe one would need describe planetary position movement
In term information theory definition also work The letter add password system information needed describe password
Then measure different unit eg bit character like hello character entropy bit entropy charsize bit
From also come information way arrange information
If bit different way arranged
If talking password possible arrangement information bit longer going take cracking brute force dictionary attack
Here great alternate explanation information theory
Entropy measure
We also describe entropy would get outcome made initial prediction
Lets say bent coin give u head time tail time
Since one percent chance getting tail would surprised actually get tail
On hand wo surprising got head already percent chance getting head
let assume function called would give u amount surprise outcome average amount surprise probability distribution
This average amount surprise could also used measure uncertain
This uncertainty called
Entropy like hash code virus researcher well
Less entropy get would mean likely encrypted compressed code could potentially virus
A standard binary would higher entropy compressed encrypted one
Entropy many meaning typically Computer Science
It depends context
In security entropy mean much randomality place instance generate private key many application ask move mouse around generate entropy
This generates entropy taking human element randomality add hashing process generating key
Now also defnition software engineering entropy
This definition represents date code code many developer writing
Typically used reference near time refactor software project
The code project enourmous amount entropy many individual maintained project currently
Here third example usage I remembered
In topic simulated annealing far computer science concerned entropy described much decay happened evaluation algorithm
I guess answer question though concrete definition word except one find dictionary
How computer science tends apply term depends context term used applied
It easy make big deal entropy
To mind pretty
Basically quantifies average learn event like flipping coin taking branch instruction indexing array
Like comparison operation middle search algorithm certain probability P taking one branch taking
Suppose P binary search
Then take branch know bit log base
On hand take branch also learn bit
To get average amount information learn multiply learn first branch time probability take branch plus learn second branch time probability branch
time bit plus time bit bit plus bit total bit entropy
That expect learn average decision
On hand suppose linear search table entry
On first test probability YES entropy YES decision bit
So answer YES learn bit chance thousand
On hand NO much likely
It entropy roughly time roughly zero zero
Add two together average learn bit decision
That linear search slow
The entropy much expect learn decision small since going learn bit find entry table
Entropy computer science commonly refers random string bit
The following question making precise In simpler word Entropy defines randomness
like unpredictable something
In technical word computing entropy randomness collected operating system application use cryptography us require random data
This randomness often collected hardware source either one mouse movement specially provided randomness defined wikipedia
One easily conclude meaning entropy respect file measurement much disordered byte file
There various unit used defining entropy like nat shannon hartley
Well common unit used Shannon
The range value entropy must come per algorithm
So entropy value zero one say outcome certain
On contrary entropy value outcome unpredictable could
The formula given Shannon measure randomness outcome event event probability
This equation always result
For information go link In simple word know probability symbol langauge one compute average information content symbol language
Or The entropy language measure information content average symbol language Consider fair coin There two symbol probability entropy calculated h entropy refers extent software reshaped occasionally basing customer requirement hence cost reshaping meet customer reqrments becomes maximum
I heard people misuse thermodynamic definition entropy CS

Entropy definitely increasing system

Cyber security includes controlling physical access hardware well protecting harm may come via network access data code injection
Also due operator whether accidental security susceptible deviating secure procedure various method
The field growing importance due increasing reliance computer system growth including tiny device part Internet Things
A vulnerability weakness design implementation operation internal control
Most vulnerability discovered documented CVE database
An vulnerability one least one working attack exists
Vulnerabilities often hunted exploited aid manually using customized script
To secure computer system important understand attack made typically classified one category A computer system algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security control
They may exist number reason including original design poor configuration
They may added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reason regardless motif existence create vulnerability
DoS designed make machine network resource unavailable intended user
Attackers deny service individual victim deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive time cause victim account locked may overload capability machine network block user
While network attack single IP address blocked adding new firewall rule many form DDoS attack possible attack come large number point defending much difficult
Such attack originate range technique possible including innocent system fooled sending traffic victim
An unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data
They may also compromise security making modification installing software using wireless mouse
Even system protected standard security measure may able booting another operating system tool bootable medium
designed prevent attack
act surreptitiously listening private conversation typically host network
For instance program used eavesdrop system
Even machine operate closed system contact outside world eavesdropped upon via monitoring faint transmission generated hardware specification NSA referring attack

These control serve purpose maintain system quality attribute confidentiality integrity availability accountability
Techopedia defines security architecture unified security design address necessity potential risk involved certain scenario environment
It also specifies apply security control
The design process generally reproducible
The key attribute security architecture A state computer security conceptual ideal attained use three process threat prevention detection response
These process based various policy system component include following Today computer security comprises mainly preventive measure like firewall
A firewall defined way filtering network data host network another network implemented software running machine hooking case operating system built operating system provide real time filtering blocking
Another implementation physical firewall consists separate machine filtering network traffic
Firewalls common amongst machine permanently connected
Some organization turning platform extend data accessibility detect
However relatively organisation maintain computer system effective detection system fewer still organised response mechanism place

Something I puzzled exactly computer regulate tell time
For example I write program Do wait second How processor know second
How time measured computer system
Is specific chip sole purpose
How work
Thanks reply I really interested computer science would love help could give
IIRC small crystal vibrates specific frequency electric current passed
Each movement counted specific number trigger clock cycle
While Joel answer correct reality bit complicated
First thing need taken consideration I going focus PCs several clock computer use
Most popular easiest understand
It basically chip simple clock inside
They usually type quartz crystal standard clock usually battery time keeping computer powered
The problem accurate seen Syntech link
The kHz crystal slow timekeeping modern system whose processor megahertz gigahertz range
Here come next point There internal clock used precise time measurement countdown
A simple clock
What wait certain amount time send interrupt CPU
When CPU receives interrupt stop whatever tend task generated interrupt
This way CPU constantly check something done
Instead focus job PIT tell job done
The PIT us MHz clock source therefore much precise simple RTC
Next interesting measurement system
The idea behind get much precise measurement time using processor clock source using various system timer
PIT MHz clock even earliest processor much higher clock
So timer updated every set amount processor cycle
At time processor stable clock use TSC nice way make precise time measurement
Use TSC however brings number problem
Different processor different tick rate measure time different speed
Later techniology advanced got modern processor change frequency
That major problem sicen CPU clock constant anymore ca use measure time
And
HPET us MHz clock therefore precise PIT
On hand clock source depend CPU clock used measure time even CPU clock change
Unlike PIT work countdown HPET measure time since computer turned compare current time time action needed
There time source available computer I believe need mentioned
Some computer connected atomic clock use precisely measure time
A le expensive option much common use external time source calibrate internal time source computer
For example GPS receiver used provide high precision time measurement GPS satellite internal atomic clock
Another option le common GPS receiver use special radio receiver decodes time information time keeping radio station example
Such time station high precision time source transmit output radio
Since radio wave travel speed light delay often insignificant
HPET us MHz clock HPET us Mhz clock
It precise Mhz never le

In unambiguous specification solve class problem
Algorithms perform task
An algorithm expressed within finite amount space time formal language calculating
Starting initial state initial input perhaps instruction describe proceeds finite number successive state eventually producing output terminating final ending state
The transition one state next necessarily algorithm known incorporate random input
The concept existed century however partial formalization would become modern began attempt solve decision problem posed
Subsequent formalization framed attempt define effective method formalization included
Giving formal definition algorithm corresponding intuitive notion remains challenging problem
The word combination word named word

Generally program algorithm stop eventually
A prototypical example algorithm determine maximum common divisor two integer example others described example later section

But human something equally useful case certain enumerably infinite set They give arbitrary finite
Such instruction given quite explicitly form An enumerably infinite set one whose element put correspondence integer
Thus Boolos Jeffrey saying algorithm implies instruction process creates output integer input integer integer theory arbitrarily large
Thus algorithm algebraic equation two arbitrary input variable produce output
But various author attempt define notion indicate word implies much something order addition example The concept also used define notion
That notion central explaining come starting small set rule
In time algorithm requires complete measured apparently related customary physical dimension
From uncertainty characterize ongoing work stem unavailability definition suit concrete sense abstract usage term
Algorithms essential way computer process data

Gurevich Turing informal argument favor thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm simulated Turing machine according Savage algorithm computational process defined Turing machine
Typically algorithm associated processing information data read input source written output device stored processing
Stored data regarded part internal state entity performing algorithm
In practice state stored one
For computational process algorithm must rigorously defined specified way applies possible circumstance could arise
That conditional step must systematically dealt criterion case must clear computable
Because algorithm precise list precise step order computation always crucial functioning algorithm
Instructions usually assumed listed explicitly described starting top going bottom idea described formally

If algorithm effective must provide set rule extracting square root
This mean programmer must know language effective relative target computing agent
But model used simulation
Van Emde Boas observes even base abstract instead concrete machine arbitrariness choice model remains
It point notion enters
When speed measured instruction set matter
For example subprogram Euclid algorithm compute remainder would execute much faster programmer instruction available rather subtraction worse Minsky decrement
Per algorithm computed model known per Minsky demonstration Turing completeness requires four instruction GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment HALT

For Euclid method succeed starting length must satisfy two requirement length must zero AND ii subtraction must proper test must guarantee smaller two number subtracted larger alternately two equal subtraction yield zero
Euclid original proof add third requirement two length must prime one another
Euclid stipulated could construct proof two number common measure fact
While Nicomachus algorithm Euclid number prime one another yield number common measure
So precise following really Nicomachus algorithm
Only instruction required execute Euclid logical test conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment replacement subtraction
The following algorithm framed Knuth version Euclid Nicomachus rather using division find remainder us successive subtraction shorter length remaining length le
The description shown boldface adapted Knuth Until remaining length R le shorter length S repeatedly subtract measuring number S remaining length EITHER last measure exact remainder R zero program halt OR ii algorithm must continue last measure left remainder R le measuring number The nut Euclid algorithm
Use remainder measure previously smaller number L serf temporary location
The following version Euclid algorithm requires six core instruction thirteen required Inelegant worse Inelegant requires instruction
The flowchart Elegant found top article
In unstructured Basic language step numbered instruction assignment instruction symbolized
The following version used Object Oriented language In place outer Euclid loop Elegant shift back forth two A B loop computes A A B B A loop computes B B A
This work last minuend M le equal subtrahend S Difference Minuend Subtrahend minuend become new measuring length subtrahend become new length measured word sense subtraction revers
Does algorithm author want
A test case usually suffice confirm core functionality
One source us
Knuth suggested
Another interesting case two number
But exceptional case must identified tested
Will Inelegant perform properly R S S R R S
Ditto Elegant B A A B A B
Yes
What happens one number zero number zero
Inelegant computes forever case Elegant computes forever A
What happens number entered
Fractional number
If input number
function computed include positive integer including zero failure zero indicate algorithm program rather
A notable failure due exception rocket failure June
Knuth demonstrates application extended version Euclid algorithm proposes general method applicable proving validity algorithm
Tausworthe proposes measure complexity program length correctness proof
With six core instruction Elegant clear winner compared Inelegant thirteen instruction
However Inelegant arrives HALT fewer step
indicates case Elegant conditional test every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant one
As algorithm usually requires many much time wasted B
test needed remainder computed
Once programmer judge program fit effective computes function intended question becomes improved
The compactness Inelegant improved elimination five step
But Chaitin proved compacting algorithm automated generalized algorithm rather done exhaustive search example found trial error cleverness insight application etc
Observe step repeated step
Comparison Elegant provides hint step together step eliminated
This reduces number core instruction thirteen eight make elegant Elegant nine step
The speed Elegant improved moving
test outside two subtraction loop
This change call addition three instruction B A GOTO
Now Elegant computes faster whether always case given A B R S would require detailed analysis
It frequently important know much particular resource time storage theoretically required given algorithm
Methods developed obtain quantitative answer estimate example sorting algorithm time requirement O using length list
At time algorithm need remember two value largest number found far current position input list
Therefore said space requirement space required store input number counted O counted
Different algorithm may complete task different set instruction le time space others
For example algorithm cost O log n outperforms sequential search cost O n used sorted list array
The discipline often practiced abstractly without use specific implementation
In sense algorithm analysis resembles mathematical discipline focus underlying property algorithm specific particular implementation
Usually used analysis simplest general representation
However ultimately algorithm usually implemented particular hardware software platform eventually put test using real code
For solution one problem efficiency particular algorithm may significant consequence unless n extremely large algorithm designed fast interactive commercial long life scientific usage may critical
Scaling small n large n frequently expose inefficient algorithm otherwise benign
Empirical testing useful may uncover unexpected interaction affect performance
may used compare potential improvement algorithm program optimization
To illustrate potential improvement possible even well established algorithm recent significant innovation relating algorithm used heavily field image processing decrease processing time time application like medical imaging
In general speed improvement depend special property problem common practical application
Speedups magnitude enable computing device make extensive use image processing like digital camera medical equipment consume le power
There various way classify algorithm merit
One way classify algorithm implementation mean
Another way classifying algorithm design methodology paradigm
There certain number paradigm different
Furthermore category include many different type algorithm
Some common paradigm For specific classification algorithm algorithm problem may fall one general category described well one following Every field science problem need efficient algorithm
Related problem one field often studied together
Some example class algorithm
Fields tend overlap algorithm advance one field may improve sometimes completely unrelated field
For example dynamic programming invented optimization resource consumption industry used solving broad range problem many field
Algorithms classified amount time need complete compared input size Some problem may multiple algorithm differing complexity problem might algorithm known efficient algorithm
There also mapping problem problem
Owing found suitable classify problem instead algorithm equivalence class based complexity best possible algorithm
The adjective continuous applied word algorithm mean Algorithms usually patentable
In United States claim consisting solely simple manipulation abstract concept number signal constitute process USPTO hence algorithm patentable
However practical application algorithm sometimes patentable
For example application simple algorithm aid curing deemed patentable
The highly controversial highly criticized patent involving algorithm especially algorithm

Contents Today type readable writable data shaped two different form
Either form soft copy form hard copy
The basic purpose two presentation storage written material data
The purpose article draw fine line hard copy soft copy clear mind reader confusion term
The term hard copy mean something touchable physical tangible soft copy mean data information stored kind digital memory
The term hard copy describes something touchable physical tangible
And copy mean result production information
So collective meaning hard copy production record information physical object form
Printed book newspaper magazine document etc
kind hard copy
Hard copy older way keeping record physical form
Although technology changed still old gold
Property paper contract agreement signed document still required kept physical form hard copy prove page book computer printout likewise page printout best example hard copy
It considered old way representing data still widely used medium data information modern world
The term hard copy sometimes also used computing purpose well
But make clear punched paper tape diskette CDs kind magnetic tape considered hard copy
The hard copy highly associated printing newspaper book likewise printout
Despite fact many advantage using hard copy system gradually decreasing involves huge cost wastage time
You easily share hard copy case original one anyone living country
In case giving another hard copy document anyone mean printing cost
But still hard copy generally accepted authentic medium information
In case validity document signature taken hard format document
Soft copy mean data information stored kind digital memory
It intangible form preserving material
You see record touch
Monitors others display screen used see soft copy result
Soft copy latest form preserving material information digital form
With invention computer concept soft copy came existence
Among lot advantage soft copy two main advantage soft copy anytime send data via email preserve data without actual physical place
In short get rid courier service bulky hard copy stored printed physical paper rather available form digital document file like digital text format image format presentation format
PDF doc file xlx file presentation file etc
best example soft copy
Instead viewing via physical medium accessed database program word processing program presentation program subject format file data
These transferred one PC operating system another PC operating system USB drive external disk drive online sharing downloading
There many advantage using soft copy make environment office paperless
But credibility soft document still stake
Despite fact digital signature system introduced still signature fixed soft copy regarded genuine one authenticate credibility document
Required field marked powerful information good information

submitted What make professor think plagiarizing Computer Science course
What criterion determine whether plagiarize
In programming assignment uncommon code similar
So professor know committed plagiarism come code code look similar someone else
Also use algorithm online put code
An example would using algorithmic code find average array assignment
If two student submitted code programming assignment naming variable different rest source code similar count plagiarizing
It common professor CS major falsely accuse student plagiarizing Thanks
Post comment
Plagiarism usually taken pretty seriously falsely accusing student happen often
As know student plagiarized first place
Take one friend assignment sometime graded returned compare
Do look structure code look code line line character character
See many difference find
I bet lot
As taking code Internet
You taking code someone else wrote passing
That plagiarism
Do
What common algorithm like find sum array
Could use something common
Early CS class teach making write program solved LONG AGO
The point get start thinking like programmer
Sure often time programming life researching actual typing early CS study need practice writing code creative effort
Sure tried true algorithm everything
But miss lot skill polishing START programming life much
The time I followed route using someone code algorithm I usually made comment code noting came
Sometimes easier use existing piece code waste hour trying write
Just make sure make note part used importantly learn used
Figure work
probably program designed parse source code detect similarity two program
Thats school
First outsource work offshore developer
But anyways When right right
Especially introductory class hard detect plagiarism unless painfully painfully obvious
file even look trend make sure coincidence
But trivial thing kinda turn blind eye probabilistically make sense collision
For upper division class inherent increased variability approach problem get easy detect plagiarism
Again look trend figure happening take lot le time would introductory class
There also exist algorithm detect plagiarism code Stanford cool tool although take I believe O n time I recall
I also Google around I suspicious feeling code submitted I find match something end
False accusation happen much look concrete evidence prior talking student
In case look University honor code department professor determine constitutes
tl dr Do cheat easy detect
You spend time avoiding detection would hack away problem
There many indicator one taken seriously multiple student write WRONG
It hard detect plagiarism program simple find average array many correct answer look similar
On hand feel like need copy somebody else code get answer program like great indication work though instead
Your ability get better work might take way time want help learn lot grabbing somebody else solution
Stealing colleague analogy learn play piano watching somebody else play piano
You need painfully
Once code longer much easier detect
Automated tool point suspect code professor look make call
It usually pretty easy tell
Changing variable name order code trick program
They efficient analyzing hundred program couple second
Most importantly something weird way even work show somebody else code big give away
And got stuff web decent chance classmate found material also got web get caught matching code
deleted That good definition solution OP question
OP think work susceptible plagiarism probably consult professor
Oh I curious
Since one assignment professor gave printing line code student
I kind wondering professor know student cheated
White space usually give away
A programmer style usually rather unique
A lot time leave sort fingerprint habit extra white space character end every line tabbing instead spacing etc
Professors tell work isnt
Easily
If worried short program looking similar another student like building first class ever data structuring member function almost relax
Its fine end using assignment statement someone else
Just dont internet
That leaf trace found professor
There always one way skin cat
I actually concern I started second level programming course
I promise PROMISE YOU use code instead fine
Literally every program assigned something already damn c library
He want practice making algorithm instead using already
I similar question
What make professor think plagiarizing Computer Science course
What criterion determine whether plagiarize
In programming assignment uncommon code similar
So professor know committed plagiarism come code code look similar someone else
Also use algorithm online put code
An example would using algorithmic code find average array assignment
If two student submitted code programming assignment naming variable different rest source code similar count plagiarizing

Difference Between Things Terms Objects Posted Last updated September These day bank ask account holder whether want hard copy soft copy bank statement
Internet Service Provider cajole customer accept soft copy bill rather pressing hard copy
So difference hard copy soft copy
This article take closer look two type document file remove confusion mind reader
The term soft copy came existence advent computer
It electronic version file digitalized seen read sent form others easily
Before mail computer even one type document specific word refer
But soft copy coming existence physical form file document labeled hard copy
So getting statement credit card mail printed paper availing hard copy bill
If insist statement sent credit card company email ID desire soft copy easily stored computer
However read soft copy special software installed computer word processor database program
Soft copy document preferred world eliminate need paper ink two object held responsible environmental pollution
Less paper used always good environment paper manufacture requires felling tree
One manipulate soft copy carry along USB drive pen drive
One even send receive soft copy wherever part world provided internet connection
For office even individual soft copy invaluable save much needed space also managed easily retrieved click button
Hard copy physical version document one hold feel hand unlike soft copy electronic read computer monitor
However possible convert soft copy hard copy printer disposal
Soft copy document save space paper considered superior hard copy One carry soft copy place also receive send soft copy provided internet connection
Soft copy electronic digital version document hard copy physical tangible

When come time edit writing project usually two option
You make edits document computer screen within word processor using print project edit pencil pen unless course another quirky way editing say acting edits fashion
Let take closer look two option When editing computer screen quickly make necessary change save time
The edit permanent use track change feature mimic writing hard copy red pen change showing different color allowing still see originally
Editing computer screen also beneficial need look back previously written
You easily use search feature find certain word character need refresh memory confirm hole plotline
This much easier search pile paper looking page specific incident character mentioned
While editing computer screen convenient read text paper understanding deeper read text computer
In addition word pattern sentence structure short long sentence etc
might stick viewing hard copy
For travel might regularly work location editing hard copy make easier wherever
You need worry battery draining finding outlet glare screen want sit outside edit
A con editing hard copy associated ink paper cost reduced using small font print draft need edited
If going edit hard copy need make sure penmanship good graphic designer assistant case
understand written come time implement change
When come editing process really right Ultimately choose whichever method comfortable
Your choice could also vary depending editing process
It might make sense print first rough draft could beneficial time proof copy

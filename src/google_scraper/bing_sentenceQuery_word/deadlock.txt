A deadlock situation two computer program sharing resource effectively preventing accessing resource resulting program ceasing function
The earliest computer operating system ran one program time
All resource system available one program
Later operating system ran multiple program interleaving
Programs required specify advance resource needed could avoid conflict program running time
Eventually operating system offered dynamic allocation resource
Programs could request allocation resource begun running
This led problem deadlock
Here simplest example Now neither program proceed program release resource
The operating system know action take
At point alternative abort stop one program

In state member group waiting member take action sending message commonly releasing lock
Deadlock common problem system software hardware used handle shared resource implement
In deadlock occurs enters waiting requested held another waiting process turn waiting another resource held another waiting process
If process unable change state indefinitely resource requested used another waiting process system said deadlock
In deadlock occur mainly due lost corrupt signal rather resource contention
A deadlock situation resource arise following condition hold simultaneously system These four condition known first description article Most current operating system prevent deadlock
When deadlock occurs different operating system respond different manner
Most approach work preventing one four Coffman condition occurring especially fourth one
Major approach follows
In approach assumed deadlock never occur
This also application
This approach initially used
This used time interval occurrence deadlock large data loss incurred time tolerable
Under deadlock detection deadlock allowed occur
Then state system examined detect deadlock occurred subsequently corrected
An algorithm employed track resource allocation process state roll back restarts one process order remove detected deadlock
Detecting deadlock already occurred easily possible since resource process locked currently requested known resource scheduler operating system
After deadlock detected corrected using one following method Deadlock prevention work preventing one four Coffman condition occurring
A similar deadlock except state process involved livelock constantly change regard one another none progressing
The term defined formally time
An early sighting published literature Babich article program correctness
Livelock special case general definition state specific process progressing
Livelock risk detect recover
If one process take action repeatedly triggered
This avoided ensuring one process chosen arbitrarily priority take action
Distributed deadlock occur used
Distributed deadlock detected either constructing global local graph deadlock detector like
deadlock falsely detected distributed system due system internal delay actually exist
For example process release resource issue request first message lost delayed coordinator detector deadlock could falsely conclude deadlock request would cause deadlock

And deadlock happens common issue noticed multiprocessing system distributed system matter parallel computing
Sponsored Links A deadlock happens occur operating system process thread come waiting state result requested system resource unfortunately held another waiting process chain happens repeated
And said process position change state known deadlock
On hand deadlock may also occur communication system signal either lost corrupted instead resource contention
Deadlock situation arise condition mutual exclusion hold wait resource holding circular wait pre emption
These condition famously known Coffman condition
It plainly assumed deadlock shall never ever occur application Ostrich algorithm
Such approach used UNIX MINIX
However approach put use time interval deadlock occurrence data loss tolerable
Here deadlock permitted occur however happens examined also corrected help algorithm
This algorithm track resource allocation besides process state roll back restarts either process detected deadlock removed
One without trouble detect deadlock already seen resource already locked known resource scheduler OS operating system
And far correction method concerned process termination resource pre emption
A deadlock removed Coffman condition prevented taking place
Livelock happens similar deadlock exemption process state involved livelock tend change respect one another however progress seen either side
Moreover turned one special case resource starvation
On hand livelock turn risk algorithm detect also recover deadlock

In computer science refers specific condition two process waiting another release resource two process waiting resource circular chain see
Deadlock common problem multiprocessing many process share specific type mutually exclusive resource known lock
Computers intended market often equipped guarantee process forcing serialization
Deadlocks particularly troubling solution avoid soft deadlock
This situation may understood analogy two people drawing diagram one pencil one ruler
If one person take pencil take ruler deadlock occurs person pencil need ruler person ruler need pencil give ruler
Both request ca satisfied deadlock occurs
The telecommunication description deadlock little stronger deadlock occurs none process meet condition move another state described process finite state machine communication channel empty
The second condition often left system important telecommunication context system
There four necessary condition deadlock occur known first description article Coffman
Deadlock occur system condition hold true
Circular wait prevention consists allowing process wait resource ensure waiting circular
One approach might assign precedence resource force process request resource order increasing precedence
That say process hold resource highest precedence resource process request resource precedence smaller
This force resource allocation follow particular ordering circular wait occur
Another approach allow holding one resource per process process request another resource must first free one currently holding
An example deadlock may occur database product following
Client application using database may require exclusive access table order gain exclusive access ask
If one client application hold lock table attempt obtain lock second table already held second client application may lead deadlock second application attempt obtain lock held first application
But particular type deadlock easily prevented using resource allocation algorithm
Another example might text formatting program accepts text sent processed return result receiving enough text work

A text editor program written sends formatter text wait result
In case deadlock may occur last block text
Since formatter may sufficient text processing suspend waiting additional text never arrive since text editor sent text
Meanwhile text editor suspended waiting last output formatter
This type deadlock sometimes referred properly used two application involved
However situation easily prevented text editor send message eg
EOF last partial block text formatter return last partial block formatting wait additional text
Nevertheless since solution deadlock prevention type deadlock must anticipated specially prevented
But algorithm implemented within operating system one application becomes blocked usually terminated meantime allowed resource may need surrender already rolled back state prior obtained application
Deadlock avoided certain information process available advance resource allocation
For every resource request system see granting request mean system enter state meaning state could result deadlock
The system grant request lead state
In order system able figure whether next state safe unsafe must know advance time number type resource existence available requested
One known algorithm used deadlock avoidance Banker algorithm requires resource usage limit known advance
However many system impossible know advance every process request
This mean deadlock avoidance often impossible
Two algorithm us technique
In algorithm exists older process O younger process Y
Process age determined time stamp process creation time
Smaller time stamp older process larger timestamps represent younger process
It important note process may unsafe state would result deadlock
The notion state refers ability system enter deadlock state
For example process request A would result unsafe state release B would prevent circular wait state unsafe system deadlock
Deadlocks prevented ensuring least one following four condition occur Often neither deadlock avoidance deadlock prevention may used
Instead deadlock detection process restart used employing algorithm track resource allocation process state roll back restarts one process order remove deadlock
Detecting deadlock already occurred easily possible since resource process locked currently requested known resource scheduler OS
Detecting possibility deadlock occurs much difficult fact undecidable halting problem rephrased deadlock scenario
However environment using mean locking resource deadlock detection may
In case possible distinguish algorithm merely waiting unlikely set circumstance occur algorithm never finish deadlock
Distributed deadlock occur distributed system distributed transaction concurrency control used
Distributed deadlock detected either constructing global graph local graph deadlock detector distributed algorithm like edge chasing

When writing application one common problem experienced deadlock
My question community What deadlock
How detect
Do handle
And finally prevent occurring
A occurs multiple process try access resource time
One process loses must wait finish
A occurs waiting process still holding another resource first need finish
So example Resource A resource B used process X process Y The best way avoid deadlock avoid process cross way
Reduce need lock anything much
In database avoid making lot change different table single transaction avoid trigger switch read much possible
Let explain real world actually real example deadlock situation crime movie
Imagine criminal hold hostage cop also hold hostage friend criminal
In case criminal going let hostage go cop wo let friend let go
Also cop going let friend criminal let go unless criminal release hostage
This endless untrustworthy situation side insisting first step
So simply two thread need two different resource lock resource need deadlock
You dating girl one day argument side waiting call
In situation side want communicate one receives call
Because neither going start communication waiting passive state wait start communication end deadlock situation
Deadlocks occur two lock aquired time grabbed different order
Ways avoid deadlock To define deadlock first I would define process
As know process nothing execution
To execute program process need resource
Resource category may include memory printer CPUs open file tape drive etc
Deadlock situation condition two process holding resource trying acquire resource release resource finish execution
In diagram two process two resource
Resource allocated process resource allocated process
To complete execution process need resource request already allocated
In way Process complete execution need already allocated
process release resource unless complete execution
So waiting another resource wait forever
So Condition
In order deadlock occur four condition must true
condition satisfied diagram
You take look section
It C idea still platform
I quote easy reading A deadlock happens two thread wait resource held neither proceed
The easiest way illustrate two lock A deadlock happens thread waiting something never occurs
Typically happens thread waiting mutex semaphore never released previous owner
It also frequently happens situation involving two thread two lock like You generally detect thing expect happen never application hang entirely
Deadlock common problem problem OS
Say two process two globally shareable resource critical section resource need accessed Initially OS assigns process process
As process running concurrently may start executing code PROBLEM arises process hit critical section
So process wait process release vice versa
So wait forever DEADLOCK CONDITION
A small
Your Mother OS You Your brother Apple Knife critical section cutting apple knife
Your mother give apple knife brother beginning
Both happy playing Executing code
Anyone want cut apple critical section point
You want give apple brother
Your brother want give knife
So going wait long long long time A deadlock occurs circular chain thread process hold locked resource trying lock resource held next element chain
For example two thread hold respectively lock A lock B trying acquire lock
Deadlock occurs two thread aquire lock prevent either progressing
The best way avoid careful development
Many embedded system protect using watchdog timer timer reset system whenever hang certain period time
Deadlock defined formally A set process deadlocked process set waiting event another process set cause
Because process waiting none ever cause event could wake member set process continue wait forever
Here four condition must present deadlock occur
If one absent deadlock possible
Mutual exclusion condition Each resource either currently assigned exactly one process available
Hold wait condition Processes currently holding resource granted earlier request new resource
No preemption condition Resources previously granted forcibly taken away process
They must explicitly released process holding
Circular wait condition There must circular chain two process waiting resource held next member chain
In general four strategy used dealing deadlock
They Just ignore problem altogether
Maybe ignore ignore
Detection recovery Let deadlock occur detect take action
Dynamic avoidance careful resource allocation
Prevention structurally negating one four condition necessary cause deadlock
A deadlock state system single capable executing action
As mentioned others deadlock typically result situation wish acquire lock resource already locked another even
There various method find avoid
One thinking hard trying lot thing
However dealing parallelism notoriously difficult people able completely avoid problem
Some formal method useful serious dealing kind issue
The practical method I aware use process theoretic approach
Here model system process language
CCS CSP ACP LOTOS use available tool check deadlock perhaps property well
Examples toolset use FDR CADP Uppaal
Some brave soul might even prove system deadlock free using purely symbolic method theorem proving look
However formal method typically require effort
learning basic process theory
But I guess simply consequence fact problem hard
Deadlock situation occurs le number available resource requested different process
It mean number available resource become le requested user time process go waiting condition time waiting increase chance check problem lackness resource situation known deadlock
Actually deadlock major problem u occurs multitasking operating system occur single tasking operating system resource present task currently running
Above explanation nice
Hope may also useful In database session
os want resource held another session
data session data also want resource held first session os
There session involved also idea
Actually Deadlocks prevent transaction continuing work
For example Suppose hold lock A request lock B And SKU hold lock B request lock A
Thanks Mutex essence lock providing protected access shared resource
Under Linux thread mutex data type
Before use initialize
To access shared resource lock mutex
If mutex already lock call block thread mutex unlocked
Upon completion visit shared resource unlock
Overall unwritten basic principle Obtain lock using shared resource
Holding lock short time possible
Release lock thread return error

If deadlock process mean starvation also
My Thinking deadlock process using resource starvation like giving chance process progress starvation deadlock Is thinking right
You first state deadlock freedom property starvation freedom property precisely
I use definition
If thread attempt acquire lock thread emphasis added succeed acquiring lock
Every thread attempt acquire lock eventually succeeds
Note starvation freedom implies deadlock freedom
Thus mutual exclusion algorithm suffers deadlock suffers starvation
A direct argument deadlock mean thread attempt acquire lock thread succeed
That starvation
A process starvation waiting resource continuously given process
This different deadlock resource given anyone held blocked process
So necessarily starvation deadlock situation
There might would independent deadlocked process
In case infinite waiting
The difference Deadlock two process waiting like cicrular waiting
On hand starvation also kind waiting proccess expecting resource never available
So difference deadlock occurs process starvation process servant resource
Both case CPU need wait infinitely deadlock definition say A system deadlock one process waiting instance never going happen
Similarly starvation also process need wait infinitely get chance execute

I reading deadlock Operating Systems
Where I came across two example
Circles label process
Squares label resource
Each dot square represents single instance resource type
An edge mean instance resource allocated process
An edge mean process waiting getting instance resource allocated
Now consider two resource allocation graph The example left involves deadlock one right involved deadlock
I understand figure release instance assigned breaking circular wait
Or release instance assigned breaking circular wait
However break circular wait figure
While I try given resource allocation graph decide deadlock I want know generalized rule tell
I found reference book speaking clearly
So bit thinking I came following fact If multiple instance resource deadlock exist combination two process allocated instance resource part least one cycle
In figure deadlock In figure deadlock So I correct realization fact
Or fact deadlock present I missing
What I asking condition met instead one still result deadlock context multiple instance resource apart four classic condition deadlock mutual exclusion preemption hold wait circular wait
All condition must satisfied time
Cycle resource allocation graph represents deadlock
Cycle RAG mean deadlock
You must check way
Let write clear step
Hope help
Your logic follows fall line need circular wait deadlock
A different type diagram model may help answering question condition met still result deadlock deadlock occur
Consider Petri Net model system based left resource allocation graph following assumption A deadlock occurs system system one resource need resource resource never available
There two reason resource resource never available
First resource taken never returned
Second never begin
If left allocation graph state deadlock Figure one possible model reach state
Assuming enough resource one way prevent deadlock process release resource taken one resource need available
Another way prevent deadlock would process allocate resource need resource need available otherwise process allocate resource
The Petri Net Figure designed way resource allocated time process every resource needed process available
Figure Figure interactive dynamic diagram
You step process see state change including occurrence deadlock Figure
Figure initialized two way resource allocated process resource allocation based left resource allocation graph

IT risk management considered component wider system
The establishment maintenance continuous update ISMS provide strong indication company using systematic approach identification assessment management information security risk
Different methodology proposed manage IT risk divided process step
According framework encompasses negative impact operation service delivery bring destruction reduction value organization also benefit enabling risk associated missing opportunity use technology enable enhance business IT project management aspect like overspending late delivery adverse business impact
Because strictly tied uncertainty applied manage risk science
rationally making choice uncertainty
Generally speaking product likelihood time Risk Likelihood Impact
The measure IT risk determined product threat vulnerability value A current Risk management framework IT Risk would TIK framework The Review Manual produced ISACA international professional association focused IT Governance provides following definition risk management There two thing definition may need clarification
First risk management ongoing iterative
It must repeated indefinitely
The business environment constantly changing new emerge every day
Second choice used manage risk must strike balance productivity cost effectiveness countermeasure value informational asset protected

The head organizational unit must ensure organization capability needed accomplish mission
These mission owner must determine security capability IT system must provide desired level mission support face real world
Most organization tight budget IT security therefore IT security spending must reviewed thoroughly management decision
A risk management methodology used effectively help management identify appropriate providing security capability
Risk management IT world quite complex multi faced activity lot relation complex activity
The picture right show relationship different related term
The American defines risk management IT field Some organization many others comprehensive ERM place
The four objective category addressed according COSO According framework IT risk transversal four category
The IT risk managed framework Enterprise risk management Risk sensitivity whole enterprise guide IT risk management process
ERM provide context business objective IT risk management The term mean organized set principle rule drive action particular field knowledge
A methodology describe specific method nevertheless specify several process need followed
These process constitute generic framework
They may broken may combined sequence may change
However risk management exercise must carry process one form another The following table compare process foreseen three leading standard
The framework recent
The Risk IT compare Risk IT ISO
The overall comparison illustrated following table
process includes In general element described ISO process included Risk IT however structured named differently
Due probabilistic nature need cost benefit analysis IT risk managed following process according SP divided following step Effective risk management must totally integrated
Information conducted application computer installation network system development undertaken using structured methodology
This step first step framework
Most elementary activity foreseen first sub process Risk assessment according SP
This step implies acquisition relevant information organization determination basic criterion purpose scope boundary risk management activity organization charge risk management activity
The purpose usually compliance legal requirement provide evidence due diligence supporting certified
The scope incident reporting plan
Another area application certification product
Criteria include risk evaluation risk acceptance impact evaluation criterion
These conditioned Establishing scope boundary organization studied mission value structure strategy location cultural environment
The constraint budgetary cultural political technical organization collected documented guide next step
The set organization charge risk management foreseen partially fulfilling requirement provide resource needed establish implement operate monitor review maintain improve ISMS
The main role inside organization Risk Management recurrent activity deal analysis planning implementation control monitoring implemented measurement enforced security policy
On contrary Risk Assessment executed discrete time point
year demand etc
performance next assessment provides temporary view assessed risk parameterizing entire Risk Management process
This view relationship Risk Management Risk Assessment depicted figure adopted OCTAVE
Risk assessment often conducted one iteration first assessment identify high risk iteration detailed analysis major risk risk
According risk assessment IT field Risk assessment receives input output previous step output list assessed risk prioritized according risk evaluation criterion
The process divided following step The following table compare ISO process framework process The Code practice information security management recommends following examined risk assessment Risk identification state could cause potential loss following identified The output sub process made There two method risk assessment information security field
Purely quantitative risk assessment mathematical calculation based security metric system application
For taking consideration different SLE determined
Then considering probability occurrence given period basis example annual rate occurrence ARO determined product ARO X SLE
It important point value considered involved asset value directly affected resource
For example consider risk scenario threat consider value data related asset contained computer reputation liability company asset deriving lost availability confidentiality data could involved
It easy understand data reputation liability worth much physical resource risk laptop hardware example
Intangible asset value huge easy evaluate consideration pure quantitative approach
Qualitative risk assessment three five step evaluation Very High Low performed organization requires risk assessment performed relatively short time meet small budget significant quantity relevant data available person performing assessment sophisticated mathematical financial risk assessment expertise required
Qualitative risk assessment performed shorter period time le data
Qualitative risk assessment typically performed interview sample personnel relevant group within organization charged security asset assessed
Qualitative risk assessment descriptive versus measurable
Usually qualitative classification done followed quantitative evaluation highest risk compared cost security measure
Risk estimation input output risk analysis split following step The output list risk value level assigned
It documented
Risks arising security threat adversary attack may particularly difficult estimate
This difficulty made worse least IT system connected Internet adversary intent capability may attack physical closeness access necessary
Some initial model proposed problem
During risk estimation generally three value given asset one loss one property Integrity
The risk evaluation process receives input output risk analysis process
It compare risk level risk acceptance criterion prioritise risk list risk treatment indication
To determine likelihood future adverse event IT system must conjunction potential place IT system
refers magnitude harm could caused threat exercise vulnerability
The level impact governed potential mission impact produce relative value IT asset resource affected criticality sensitivity IT system component data
The methodology encompasses nine primary step Risk mitigation second process according SP third according ISO risk management involves prioritizing evaluating implementing appropriate control recommended risk assessment process
Because elimination risk usually impractical close impossible responsibility senior management functional business manager use approach implement appropriate control decrease mission risk acceptable level minimal adverse organization resource mission
The risk treatment process aim selecting security measure risk produce risk treatment plan output process residual risk subject acceptance management
There list select appropriate security measure single organization choose appropriate one according business strategy constraint environment circumstance
The choice rational documented
The importance accepting risk costly reduce high led fact risk acceptance considered separate process
Risk transfer apply risk high easy reduce significantly likelihood mean security control premium compared mitigation cost eventually evaluating mixed strategy partially treat risk
Another option outsource risk somebody efficient manage risk
Risk avoidance describe action way conducting business changed avoid risk occurrence
For example choice storing sensitive information customer avoidance risk customer data stolen
The
risk remaining risk treatment decision taken estimated ensure sufficient protection achieved
If residual risk unacceptable risk treatment process iterated
Risk mitigation systematic methodology used senior management reduce mission risk
Risk mitigation achieved following risk mitigation option Address greatest risk strive sufficient risk mitigation lowest cost minimal impact mission capability suggestion contained Risk communication horizontal process interacts bidirectionally process risk management
Its purpose establish common understanding aspect risk among organization stakeholder
Establishing common understanding important since influence decision taken
The Risk Reduction Overview method specifically designed process
It present comprehensible overview coherence risk measure residual risk achieve common understanding
Risk management ongoing never ending process
Within process implemented security measure regularly monitored reviewed ensure work planned change environment rendered ineffective
Business requirement vulnerability threat change time
Regular audit scheduled conducted independent party
somebody control responsible implementation daily management
Security control validated
Technical control possible complex system tested verified
The hardest part validate people knowledge procedural control effectiveness real application daily business security procedure
internal external instrument verifying status security control
organizational procedural control aim evaluating security
The IT system organization evolving quite rapidly
Risk management cope change change authorization risk evaluation affected system process periodically review risk mitigation action
Monitoring system event according security monitoring strategy incident response plan security validation metric fundamental activity assure optimal level security obtained
It important monitor new vulnerability apply procedural technical security control like regularly evaluate kind control deal
The attitude involved people follow seminar sector factor assure state art organization IT risk management practice
Effective risk management must totally integrated
An IT system SDLC five phase initiation development acquisition implementation operation maintenance disposal
The risk management methodology regardless SDLC phase assessment conducted
Risk management iterative process performed major phase SDLC
SP devoted topic
Early integration security SDLC enables agency maximize return investment security program This guide focus information security component SDLC
First description key security role responsibility needed information system development provided
Second sufficient information SDLC provided allow person unfamiliar SDLC process understand relationship information security SDLC
The document integrates security step linear sequential
waterfall SDLC
The SDLC cited document example one method development intended mandate methodology
Lastly SP provides insight IT project initiative clearly defined development architecture project IT facility development
Security incorporated information system acquisition development maintenance implementing effective security practice following area
Information system security begin incorporating security requirement process new application system enhancement
Security designed system beginning
Security requirement presented vendor requirement phase product purchase
Formal testing done determine whether product meet required security specification prior purchasing product
Correct processing application essential order prevent error mitigate loss unauthorized modification misuse information
Effective coding technique include validating input output data protecting message integrity using encryption checking processing error creating activity log
Applied properly cryptographic control provide effective mechanism protecting confidentiality authenticity integrity information
An institution develop policy use encryption including proper key management
Disk Encryption one way protect data rest
protected alteration unauthorized viewing using SSL certificate issued Certificate Authority implemented Public Key Infrastructure
System file used application must protected order ensure integrity stability application
Using source code repository version control extensive testing production plan appropriate access program code effective measure used protect application file
Security development support process essential part comprehensive quality assurance production control process would usually involve training continuous oversight experienced staff
Applications need monitored patched technical vulnerability
Procedures applying patch include evaluating patch determine appropriateness whether successfully removed case negative impact
Risk management scientific methodology criticized shallow
Major IT risk management programme large organization mandated US criticized
By avoiding complexity accompanies formal probabilistic model risk uncertainty risk management look like process attempt guess rather formally predict future basis statistical evidence
It highly subjective assessing value asset likelihood threat occurrence significance impact
However better way deal subject emerged
It quite hard list method least partially support IT risk management process
Efforts direction done Enisa report classified different method regarding completeness free availability tool support result The FAIR main document An Introduction Factor Analysis Information Risk FAIR Risk Management Insight LLC November outline method lack rigorous definition risk factor

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I new computer science programming I wondering difference computer science programming
get choose study one university
We looking long answer provide explanation context
Do give answer explain answer right ideally citation
Answers include explanation may removed
Computer science study computer programming practice making computer thing
Take look offered university interested find whether course CS course programming course something else example Software Engineering even combination
Many course advertised computer science offer significant programming component may put theoretical part course practice may sake learn skill making program
A caveat Science become muddied field modern time least United States university degree programming
This mean people interested programming must sign Computer Science degree reaction Computer Science program emphasize programming
That said Computer Science mathematical science Computational Mathematics might better term
It involves study graph theory algorithmic complexity formal logic automaton general logical structure describe transformation response input algorithm
A Computer Scientist classic sense could reason rule govern computing system including modern computer without necessarily knowing detail implementation current architecture
A strong background Computer Science give ability develop recall efficient scalable algorithm anticipate logical reduction reason soundly tractable
Programming contrast person use transform something machine
That make obvious intimate connection Computer Science much confusion come
A programmer relative environment language able take virtually set algorithm transform form writing code
A strong background programming CS degree provide enables write better code code easily understood others successful expressing algorithm implementing
There large amount crosstalk course high level experience one correspond strongly developing experience noted CS major almost always competent programmer seasoned programmer picked many principle CS
Think Physics Engineering
A good way remembering difference requires computer see work programming pencil paper Computer Science
Computer science deal theoretical foundation information computation practical technique implementation application
Computer science computer astronomy telescope
Edsger Dijkstra Programming craft creating computer program
Computer Science point view supposed Hard Science like Physics
It involves study compiler compiler generator hardware architecture concept various form number system algorithm algorithmic efficiency performance theory behind arithmetic operation processor
When I CS university spent lot time mucking around assembler learning difference compiling linking interpreting etcetera
A lot done programming act writing code compiled run via interpreter intention generating result solve problem
That Programming act solving problem described knowledge Computer Science
It kind Pure Maths Applied Maths split
You need Computer Science degree programmer programmer CS background likely deeper understanding behaviour computer program
I would reword question What difference Computer Science Software Engineering
After involve programming
Computer Science theortical study computation possible
It look thing like Godels Theorem Halting problem
Software engineering write program designed maintanable
theory programming
Programming implementation
scientific practical approach computation application
A computer scientist specializes theory computation design computational system
Its subfields divided variety theoretical practical discipline
Some field computational complexity theory explores fundamental property computational problem highly abstract field computer graphic emphasize visual application
Still field focus challenge implementing computation
For example programming language theory considers various approach description computation whilst study computer programming investigates various aspect use programming language complex system
interaction considers challenge making computer computation useful usable universally accessible human
If programming carpentry computer science
More info carpentry interested thing like order build thing frame subfloor interior wall drywall etc
How build take le time construct modified later
In case architecture part like CS anyway concerned thing like capability material big beam need support span
Similarly CS theoretical capability computer programming practical application knowledge
Computer science programming physic mechanical engineering
Computer science theoretical take scientific mathematical approach information computation
Computer programming practical process designing writing testing debugging maintaining source code computer program
They different related field
Both benefited
A degree computer science lot broader scope cover theory behind computing
A hand focused developing coding programming skill student training different programming language
If confused browse detail program California College San Diego
That may provide clarity regarding scope degree
It study problem solving method
Computer programming It part problem solving process make field computer science
Computer programming small subset computer science
Programming people
People read write maintain code
Computer science implement describe algorithm
Programming development making money
Science discovering new thing
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Visual Basic Microsoft language used writing Windows application
With Visual Basic VB programmer design application programming environment look lot like Windows
The current version Visual used application
There also Visual Basic Applications used Excel application
Visual Basic evolved lot year history
As name suggests programming language origin BASIC used largely student language
The goal Visual Basic simplify process writing Windows program build step programming environment make programmer waste time writing line unnecessary code
Visual Basic built GUI application mind visual indeed
The first version released
For new release every year two
VB came VB
VB reigned five year replaced significantly different product Visual
The environment necessitated change
One big change shared library VB language
VB became similar language like C
This created controversy Visual Basic community
The language become flexible argue quite simple intuitive
It arguably still one easiest language pick
For first time VB placed within reach hobbyist
Microsoft something programming environment done earlier release It released free Express version
There course multiple version Visual Basic suit different need
The language confused Visual Basic Applications VBA although VBA incorporates element Visual Basic
VBA thing like automate report database communication
It also extend functionality Microsoft Office application
Microsoft ubiquitous programming environment
Visual Basic among popular computer language
TIOBE place VB spot year earlier October
often used business application
Positions may favor experience SQL Microsoft language college degree
Check undergraduate degree program Although Visual Basic longer supported Microsoft still find job ad citing experience language
There many online resource learning Visual Basic
The main thing make sure learning current version one match installed computer
How Start Programming start basic concept reassurance wo typing binary progress lesson
Do select particular concept statement progress bar etc
Tutorials taught primarily video
different sort tutorial
There lot category subcategories click want see code
It quite reference necessarily written true beginner
FunctionX also provides introduction Visual
Of course Microsoft provides lot resource
You access conceptual documentation video library Visual Studio section Microsoft Software Developer Network MSDN
You also find link language reference section includes table keywords another attribute
You may want explore CodePlex project
There additional Visual Studio resource common Visual Basic C
You visit Visual Basic forum separate part MSDN site

floor Excella Arlington Tech Exchange Using Agile one team one product backlog straightforward
But scale support larger involve people reasonably fit single team
Most agile practitioner recommend scaling feature team team pull feature product backlog complete
Most large organization prefer scaling component team team focus development component subsystem used create part feature
It would naive assume one type team always superior another situation given diversity organization work
In session I describe apply economic framework making informed tradeoff considering whether scale component team feature team blended model
By considering economic consequence choice address waste better achieve fast flexible flow feature maintaining integrity core component

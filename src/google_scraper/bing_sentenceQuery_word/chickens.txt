What learned avian brain behavior last year contradicts hundred year misinformed view chicken bird
Much previously thought exclusive domain human primate communication brain cognitive function social behavior discovered chicken bird
It nothing short revolution understanding chicken
Recent scientific research chicken behavior confirms many observed chicken closely year long known true chicken far intelligent cognitively sophisticated previously believed
While intelligence level morally relevant criterion treat others finding help u debunk prejudice harmful stereotype chicken contribute utterly abysmal status society
To frank treat like unfeeling unthinking object
In fact chicken turkey combined represent animal killed food
Some billion globally slaughtered year six week age
One striking discovery made researching subject modern domesticated chicken contrary popular belief much common wild jungle fowl descends
As author Annie Potts point Despite different circumstance wild domestic fowl behaviour permitted natural expression remain This contradicts common belief natural behavior desire essentially bred domestic chicken
Chickens distinct vocalization communicate wide range information pertaining territory mating nesting distress danger fear contentment food discovery
A January feature story The Scientific American called open explaining chicken deceptive cunning posse communication skill par primate us sophisticated signal convey intention
When making decision chicken take account prior experience knowledge surrounding situation
It solve complex problem empathizes individual The lead researcher SA article also published numerous depth scientific report study chicken behavior August also featured recent documentary watch clicking title
Among many striking finding work Smith provides multiple example chicken use highly complex form communication using signal functionally referential representational form communication observed many primate bird raven chickadee
One example kind communication male entice female food form immediately lead mating
This mean female take time eavesdrop evaluate male behavior also must form various male reputation providing food commit various experience memory
Only female express mating preference
Another example Smith offer submissive male flock use clever deceptive strategy court female diverting attention away dominant male would otherwise derail plan
The objective outsmart dominant male attracting potential mate away without getting wise submissive male intention
And strategy often succeeds
Potts cite example chicken responding call indicating presence novel food much food call known food
Thus appears cognitive process involved representational thinking chicken similar required associative learning A hierarchal order important social life chicken
The head rooster protects territory group inhabits well chick hen group
Groups composed dominant hen remain close head rooster well submissive hen rooster keep closer periphery
Roosters display number courting ritual attract mate
Hens attracted rooster based physical behavioral characteristic
The pecking order established maintains order stability within group
Additionally Smith identifies specific chicken behavior demonstrate complex social world including individual tend others learn likely imitation emulation An article called July present finding research team Imperial College London found area brain human bird important cognition memory problem solving wired region brain similar Professor Murray Shanahan author study wrote Birds evolving separately mammal around million year hardly surprising microscope brain bird look quite different mammal
Yet bird shown remarkably intelligent similar way mammal human Yet many animal ethicist behavioral expert point problem comparison prevent u authentic understanding chicken think feel
Karen Davis president presented tremendously analysis comparison article entitled
Leading avian neurologist researcher argues instead ranking animal according simplistic anthropocentric model intelligence would accurate assessment recognized many different measure kind intelligence
And evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff explains article comparison silly dangerous suggest animal suffer le smarter one
Moreover never able know certain form intelligence animal might posse could simply outside human understanding
As author Annie Potts explains While chicken display feeling comparable human grief fear happiness doubt also posse exceptional form emotion consciousness even rigorous scientific test may begin uncover simply inimitable perspective chicken register conceptually experientially within human yet another measure cognition awareness animal mind
Science aside u easily identify emotion animal close like dog cat
And u spend lot time around chicken see visceral diverse expression emotion yet society still generally believe chicken express emotional state act emotion
But case chicken behavior emotion science proving popular opinion wrong
A Spring gained important new insight mind domestic hen discovering first time show clear physiological behavioral empathic response chick
We found adult female bird posse least one essential underpinning attribute empathy ability affected share emotional state another reported Jo Edgar PhD student involved Bristol study
The research team belief finding great importance since chicken modern agriculture routinely forced witness pain suffering death flock mate
Such witnessing trauma distress could exacerbate already animal forced live
Those u observe chicken daily basis see memory recall action wide variety everyday situation
Recent science tell u chicken recognize individual face even several month separation
They also confirm chicken consider future practice benefit later reward something previously believed exclusive human primate
As stated earlier chicken learn trial error
They retain learned past experience recall apply learned future situation
Researcher Monash University Australia released study chicken behavior May
An important part study involved observation mother hen chick specifically mother hen taught young edible food item chick learned retained learned mother hen modified teaching based progress chick learning
One recent high profile study chicken behavior veteran researcher Christine Nicol University Bristol credit chicken ability perform complex skill within day hatching basic arithmetic self control basic structural engineering skill develop human toddler year
The mass medium turned comparison catchy headline like Ethologist University Trento Italy widely recognized pioneer chicken behavior cognition research specifically newly hatched chick
His work demonstrates chick born understanding basic arithmetic geometry physic advanced quick learning retention
Italian psychologist Rosa Rugani Lucia Regolin Vallortigara showed single object smaller set object
The chick study found imprint bond object mother flock mate
The complex numerical ability manipulate number performing simple arithmetic
We know rhesus monkey know chick explain researcher
In recent interview Vallortigara explains Basically I use young domestic chick investigate origin knowledge I interested core knowledge ability like number space time cause I trying clarify much ability already available birth interaction object world may shaped learning experience
We found indeed newly hatched chick posse surprisingly sophisticated ability birth know basic principle physic solidity could perform basic arithmetic small numerousness deal geometry enclosed surface orient While scientific researcher appear reluctant extrapolate ethical implication work chicken behavior many identify routine chicken farming practice present serious ethical problem
From stage chicken science presented confirms chicken exploited meat egg endure staggering degree physical psychological suffering
Neuroscientist Lesley Rogers author argues compelled understand cognitive ability chicken bird exploited least respected avian specie
Even Vallortigara claim see ethical implication discovery nonetheless make clear ethical judgment say Moreover exploitation billion chicken every year biological requirement animal flesh morally indefensible
When easily make choice harm animal Karen Davis eloquently articulates article Much research chicken behavior biology motivated poultry industry objective efficiently exploit chicken resource
As author Annie Potts point book It coincidence first creature full genome map chicken Gallus studied specie world
Every biological feature experimented aim rendering chicken serviceable Free Harm opposes animal breeding exploitation includes animal testing recognize even observational study conducted natural environment possible encourage natural behavior present ethical problem
Aside ethical challenge observational study chicken behavior intended benefit specie rather industry exploit may great value changing society attitude toward chicken
The bird study spared life agricultural commodity
And researcher work rehome animal sanctuary private individual care companion
While science provides important empirical validation understanding chicken behavior anyone inquisitive mind interest chicken learn great deal observing interacting
In short time individual personality rich life experience revealed
Free Harm documented using photo story provide intimate portrayal chicken pleasure getting know
Karen Davis also offered compelling chronicle year experience rescued bird sanctuary essay A future article focus learning chicken behavior sanctuary

Chickens make interesting fun pet also make interesting fun subject science project
Students observe record change environment affect chicken development behavior
They also experiment egg incubate hatch fertilized egg
Changes environment produce change chicken behavior
Testing whether music affect egg production may reveal sensitive chicken environment
Carefully measure record feed ration ensure change feeding affect result experiment keep water free choice keep experiment humane
Also record control week experiment week order sufficient data comparison
To test music effect egg production choose style music single song play week coop
Try different music following week record compare result
Egg production generally decrease winter
However testing whether hour light produce egg answer whether decrease production caused fewer daylight hour colder temperature
Again carefully measure record feed ration ensure change feeding affect result experiment keep water free choice keep experiment humane
Also record control week experiment week order sufficient data comparison
Install light timer hen house
Add one hour extra light inside hen house first week record production
Each week add additional hour light reach total hour light including daylight
Record compare result
Developing chicken embryo need oxygen live grow yet eggshell appear hard solid
Prove eggshell solid appear allow water penetrate surface egg
Use five egg project
Mark egg identifying number letter using crayon
Weigh egg scale capable distinguishing change weight small gram

Chickens may bird brain eye different matter
When come color vision farm fowl bested human many way new study find
The superior color vision come eye structurally speaking researcher say
They mapped five type light receptor eye
They discovered receptor laid interwoven mosaic maximized chicken ability see many color given part retina structure back eye
Based analysis bird clearly u several way term color vision said study author Joseph Corbo Washington University School Medicine Louis Mo
Color receptor organization chicken retina greatly exceeds seen retina certainly mammalian retina
Birds likely owe exceptional color vision spent period evolutionary history dark according Corbo
relies photoreceptors retina called rod daytime vision relies receptor called cone
During age dinosaur mammal became nocturnal million year
Birds widely believed descendant dinosaur never spent similar period nocturnal animal
As result bird type cone mammal
The human retina cone sensitive red blue green wavelength explained Corbo
Avian retina also cone detect violet wavelength including ultraviolet specialized receptor called double cone believe help detect motion
In addition avian cone specialized structure Corbo compare cellular sunglass drop oil within cone pigmented filter particular range light
Researchers used drop map location different type cone chicken retina
While different type cone evenly distributed throughout retina two cone type located next
This ideal way uniformly sample color space field vision said Corbo
It appears global pattern created simple localized rule You next cone next kind cone
Corbo speculates extra sensitivity color may help bird often involves colorful plumage feeding berry colorful fruit
study look eye organization established
Corobo say insight could eventually help scientist seeking use stem cell new technique treat nearly genetic disorder cause various form blindness

Tracking device worn around chicken ankle track movement aviary food nesting perching site located different tier
Christina Rufener It look like chaos inside commercial aviary
In barn thousand squawking flap perch grabbing food one level rolling dust another laying egg nesting area
Animal welfare researcher trying make sense madness
He colleague tracking chicken move aviary
The study ongoing result published yet found far surprised
You go barn brown bobbing head look say Toscano based University Bern
But peering bit deeper research indicates least chicken tracking smaller flock Each one routine
Each bird different appear consistently Like chicken seems daily schedule stick almost like clockwork
Toscano want learn pattern try tease factor encourage healthy behavior laying hen
That could help egg producer well chicken
The chicken tracking study funded two foundation well Swiss government started way study bone fracture farming
As bird hop flap around aviary likely hurt instance crashing pen chicken
In mature flock percent bird extension breast bone wing muscle attach
If bird damage affect mobility Toscano wondered
At time colleague noticed within aviary bird choose go outdoors time never go
If visit one large commercial flock access outside look great go inside see bird percent larger flock say Toscano
The farmer everything bird deciding go outside
Why A closer look tracking device chicken leg
Christina Rufener The group preliminary study suggested chicken went outside healthier bone lung may even happier
Evidence suggests rodent happy brain hippocampus grows new neuron whereas neuron tend decrease hippocampus chronically depressed rodent
Similarly bird regularly went outside higher marker neural growth
By putting tracker chicken Toscano hoping learn factor make le likely go outside keel bone damage affect bird mobility egg production
To get started researcher devise way tell bird apart
Commercial aviary like city say Toscano
There anywhere bird one aviary way tell apart since similar color Farmers able track dairy cow easily
Because big cattle carry large GPS unit accelerometer veterinarian instantly alerted member herd injured
But chicken smaller live crowded condition team develop tracking technology
One option use RFID tracker
These tiny tag require battery
Instead chicken pass front antenna recognizes individualized chip tied around chicken ankle recording identity time location computer
The problem radio system work well inside aviary mostly made metal
The option ended working better use infrared beam
Beams different zone feeding area versus perch bird encoded different signal
When beam hit receiver chicken ankle tell tracker zone chicken time
The data get recorded device researcher download every day
The left graph show movement chicken throughout pattern differ
The graph right show one chicken movement several day see chicken moved different level aviary pretty consistent schedule every day
Michael Toscano The result graph plot chicken progress tier aviary throughout day
So far found bird daily routine unique follows schedule every day
We expect consistent could tell separate animal looking graph say Toscano
Individual tracking individual within large group important goal difficult get technology promise much actually work well practice say animal welfare researcher University Bristol involved study
It sound like Mike Toscano got really neat recording system
Toscano crew placed tracker chicken spread across six pen bird
They track bird location session different time point week age
At time point take bird
If keel bone broken able compare bird activity level damage
The data reveal injury affect mobility teach farmer recognize sign keel bone damage flock
Infrared beam glowing purple encoded location data
When beam hit tracker bird ankle tracker record itme level aviary bird
Christina Rufener By feeding chicken pill special dye change yolk color egg produce study keep track many individual laying impacted mobility keel bone damage
If data show bird broken keel bone produce many egg would provide extra incentive farmer address problem
Eventually Toscano hope scale experiment see pattern hold large flock well
With data deluge coming tracker Toscano team also start look new pattern chaos
Do group bird tend use tier often
In word chicken friend
And one bird change pattern affect others
We know bird damage move differently say Toscano
But gotten much bigger
There whole area individual variation
Looking graph definitely show thinking That might exactly egg producer consumer want hear even entirely surprising
This research open lot difficult question kind question need asked say Toscano
If animal going provide u meat milk egg responsibility meet certain standard

People raising chicken year
Chickens first domesticated Indian
You might think chicken farm animal even people city raise chicken backyard
Chicken coop take much room
Chickens raised mostly egg meat ultimately chicken also make good pet
Chickens raised mostly egg meat chicken also make good pet
Some chicken tame allow hold pet
Chickens eat almost anything grass table scrap
If clean plate chicken
A healthy chicken lay egg year
lot omelet
Chickens cluck lay egg
Watch video chicken A video aboutÂ private life chicken
Do chicken lay white egg
Some chicken lay brown blue green egg
How long chicken live
Most chicken live year

A special sort member intermediate functionality
The syntax reading writing property like field property read writes usually translated method call
The syntax easier read write lot method call yet interposition method call hood allows element implementation may called field
See instructive example C language
Programming language support property include
Some language support property require programmer define pair method instead
provides alternative mechanism using object variable visibility flag
Other language designed natively support property
While first class property emulated due operator overloading
Also note compiler support first class property Microsoft compiler example
In language property implemented pair method accessed using syntax public field
Omitting method pair yield uncommon property
In language support property similar construct implemented single method either return change underlying data depending context invocation
Such technique used

Some language Ruby Smalltalk achieve syntax using normal method sometimes limited amount
Some language follow syntax convention formally specifying utilizing property method
Among convention The following example demonstrates dot notation JavaScript
The following example demonstrates bracket notation JavaScript
Recent C version also allow property backing field property generated compiler compilation
This mean property must setter however private
first class property exist several way emulate property limited degree
Two follow An example taken MSDN
In D version property accessor mutator must marked property The example could used arbitrary method like Properties work correctly class class available Python newer see
Python added new syntax involving decorator defining property
Ruby also provides automatic synthesizer defined instance method Class

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

I trying figure best way handle derived class also property I want also derived different class
Let show simplified class Now I like able And I thought using Generics I would But I sure recommended entity would work EF Code First
The way I though going constraining AttendanceCode constrain constructor like I wondering recommended way dealing type situation see pitfall using one approach
Theres conflict design
Each concrete implementation contains exactly one concrete implemenation
always always Just write function body appropriately everything fine
Whenever instantiate pas make sure
Likewise whenever instantiate pas make sure Your constructor example look fine
In body something like The thing I would suggest change name many look alike

These seem mean thing
But term appropriate context
Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
In general term normal English usage term mean thing
In specific context HTML Javascript term get confused HTML representation DOM element term used XML pair contained within tag represented JavaScript object attribute appear object
To confuse thing change property typically update attribute
For example changing update element reflected call
However subsequently property normalised absolute URL even though might relative URL
These word existed way Computer Science came around
Attribute quality object someone something
For example scepter attribute power statehood
Property quality
For example clay adhesive quality one property metal electrical conductivity
Properties demonstrate though physical phenomenon without need attribute someone something
By token saying someone masculine attribute
In effect could say property owned someone something
To fair though Computer Science two word least part used interchangeably programmer usually hold degree English Literature write care much grammar book
Often used describe mechanism thing
A used describe model
For instance document sitting desk may attribute draft
The class model document property indicate whether draft
In case property capture state
The precise meaning term going depend lot talking
In attribute part tag equal sign value property mean anything example
So need information domain discussing
An attribute actual thing use within HTML tag like In instance type checked attribute
The property though value attribute browser save inside DOM element
Often value attribute property equal make confusing
In example DOM element property value property value notice value differs value inside HTML attribute
Using Firebug observe behaviour property clicking element selecting DOM view
In Python A property single name wrap collection setter getter deleter function
An attribute usually single object within another object
Having said however Python give method like allow extend definition attribute
Bottom Line almost synonymous
Python make technical distinction implemented
would one way look
In C In HTML seems attribute specific DOM tree property used describe characteristic DOM element Delphi used property found way architect
In Delphi often used combination runtime type information integrated property editor used set property designtime
Properties always related field
They function possible side effect course bad design
In Java language using depends usage Property used value change often usually used startup environment variable Attributes value object child Element object change time persistent What difference Attribute Property
What difference Feature Function
What difference Characteristic Character
What difference Act Behavior
Its change context
Object Product Personality Person A Person Acts Behavior
A Personality Characteristics given Character
A Product Feature derive Functionality
An Object Attributes give Properties

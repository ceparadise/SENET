discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

PAMELA SAMUELSON When computer program first developed proprietary right issue much concern
Software often developed academic research setting
Much progress programming field occurred result informal exchange software among academic researcher
In course exchange program developed one person might extended improved number colleague would send back others revised version software
Computer manufacturer period often provided software customer machine make major product computer commercially attractive caused software characterized bundled hardware
To extent computer program distributed period firm proprietary right software important program tended developed distributed restrictive trade secret licensing agreement
In general individually negotiated customer
The licensing tradition early day software industry framed industry expectation proprietary right issue implication issue still litigated today
In program began become diverse complex firm began invest development program began envision wider market software product public dialogue began develop kind proprietary right available computer program
The industry trade secrecy licensing protection thought legal protection might needed
Copyright law one existing intellectual property system thought computer program might potentially fit
Copyright number potential advantage software could provide relatively long term protection unauthorized copying based minimal showing creativity simple inexpensive registration process
Copyright would protect work idea contained
Others would free use idea software develop independently similar work
All would forbidden copying expression first author work
In
Copyright Office considered whether begin accepting registration computer program copyrightable writing
It decided rule doubt condition full text program deposited office would available public review
The Copyright Office doubt copyrightability program Under federal copyright statute effect law mainly used protect published work unauthorized copying distribution
Protection lasted year could renewed additional year
After work could freely copied
Upon publication copyright notice appear copy work else work would considered dedicated public domain
The author would generally register work Copyright Office upon publication
The Copyright Office would give work cursory examination determine met copyright modest substantive standard
After examination upon payment modest fee office would issue certificate registration
Unpublished work generally protected state law
Under Copyright Act right copyright attach original work authorship moment first fixation tangible medium last life author plus year
Registration Copyright Office remains simple inexpensive process registration necessary bring action copyright infringement right attach

See Samuelson CONTU revisited The case copyright protection computer program form Duke

The Copyright Office deny registration work clearly uncopyrightable occasion register work whose copyrightability office doubt leaving court ultimate question whether work qualifies copyright protection
The registration certificate issued work reflect issuance rule doubt
arose Supreme Court decision held piano roll infringing copy copyrighted music rather part mechanical device
Mechanical device process traditionally excluded copyright domain
Although office aware form computer program mechanical character also textual character Copyright Office decided accept registration
The requirement full text source code program deposited order copyright program registered consistent practice Copyright Office well long perceived constitutional purpose copyright namely promoting creation dissemination knowledge
Relatively program however registered Copyright Office policy
Several factor may contributed
Some firm may deterred requirement full text source code deposited office made available public inspection would dispelled trade secret status
Some may thought registration certificate issued rule doubt might worth much
However main reason low number copyright registration probably mass market software still lay future
Copyright useful mainly protect product trade secrecy quite adequate program small number distributed copy
Shortly Copyright Office issued policy registrability computer program Patent Office issued policy statement concerning view patentability computer program
It rejected idea computer program intellectual process might embodied patentable subject matter

Although patent right considerably shorter duration copyright patent right considered stronger one may make use sell claimed invention without patent owner permission life patent
Patents give right someone copy protected innovation even develop independently
Also much copyright law would consider unprotectable functional content idea described book protected patent law
The Patent Office policy denying patentability program innovation consistent recommendation presidential commission convened make suggestion office could effectively cope age exploding technology

Report President Commission Patent System To Promote Progress Useful Arts Age Exploding Technology quoted Uncertainty exists whether statute permit valid patent granted program
Direct attempt patent program rejected ground nonstatutory subject matter
Indirect attempt obtain patent avoid rejection drafting claim process machine component thereof programmed given manner rather program confused issue permitted
The Patent Office examine application program lack classification technique requisite search file
Even available reliable search would feasible economic tremendous volume prior art generated
Without search patenting program would tantamount mere registration presumption validity would nonexistent
It noted creation program undergone substantial satisfactory growth absence patent protection copyright protection program presently available
Some would argue report conclusion valid today year ago
See Kahin The software patent crisis Technology Review April early overturning Patent Office rejection computer application software developer looked patent system protection two Supreme Court decision ruled patent protection available algorithm
These decision generally regarded calling question patentability software innovation although continued pursue patent software innovation notwithstanding decision
As drew close despite seeming availability copyright protection computer program software industry still relying principally trade secrecy licensing agreement
Patents seemed largely totally unavailable program innovation
Occasional suggestion made new form legal protection computer program devised practice day trade secrecy licensing discourse additional protection focused overwhelmingly copyright
During computer science research community grew substantially size
Although software distributed restrictive licensing agreement much software well innovative idea develop software continued exchanged among researcher field
The result much research published discussed openly research conference
Toward end period number important research idea began make way commercial project seen impediment research computer scientist commercial venture tended arise research published
Researchers period part seek proprietary right software software idea although reward tenure recognition field available whose innovative research published
Four significant development changed landscape software industry intellectual property right concern developed software
Two development computing field two legal development
The first significant computing development introduction market personal computer PC machine made possible improvement design semiconductor chip memory storage
These case discussed length Samuelson supra note device processing unit
A second visible commercial success early PC application notably Visicalc Lotus significantly contributed demand PCs well making software developer aware fortune could made selling software
With development base large mass market software finally place
During period computer manufacturer began realize advantage encourage others develop application program could executed brand computer
One form encouragement involved making available software developer whatever interface information would necessary development application program could interact operating system software provided vendor computer information might otherwise maintained trade secret
Another form encouragement pioneered Apple Computer recognized potential value consumer ultimately Apple relatively consistent look feel application program developed run Apple computer
Apple developed detailed guideline application developer aid construction consistent look feel
The first important legal place first successful software application introduced passage amendment copyright statute resolve lingering doubt whether copyright protection available computer program
These amendment adopted recommendation National Commission New Technological Uses Copyrighted Works CONTU Congress established study number new technology issue affecting copyrighted work
The CONTU report emphasized written nature program text made seem much like written text long protected copyright law
The CONTU report noted successful expansion boundary copyright year take new technology product photograph motion picture sound recording
It predicted computer program could also accommodated copyright regime
Copyright law perceived CONTU best alternative protection computer program existing intellectual property regime
Trade secrecy CONTU noted inherently unsuited product first sale product open market would dispel secret
CONTU observed Supreme Court ruling cast Whether computer program protectable copyright law prior amendment subject dispute
See Samuelson supra note
See CONTU report supra note doubt availability patent protection software
CONTU confidence copyright protection computer program also partly based economic study commissioned
This economic study regarded copyright suitable protecting software unauthorized copying sale first copy marketplace fostering development independently created program
The CONTU majority expressed confidence judge would able draw line protected expression unprotected idea embodied computer program routinely kind copyrighted work
A strong dissenting view expressed novelist John Hersey one member CONTU commission regarded program mechanical protected copyright law
Hersey warned software industry intention cease use trade secrecy software
Dual assertion trade secrecy copyright seemed incompatible copyright historical function promoting dissemination knowledge
Another development period Copyright Office dropped earlier requirement full text source code deposited
Now first last page source code deposited register program
The office also decided objection copyright owner blacked portion deposited source code reveal trade secret
This new policy said consistent new copyright statute protected published unpublished work alike contrast prior statute protected mainly published work
With enactment software copyright amendment software developer legal remedy event someone began exact copy developer program competition owner copyright program
Unsurprisingly first software copyright case involved exact copying whole substantial portion program code court found copyright infringement
Copyright litigation late began grapple question besides program code copyright protects computer program
Because litigation affect current legal framework protection computer program issue raised case dealt next section
As CONTU Commissioner Hersey anticipated software developer give claim valuable trade secret embodied program enactment amendment copyright statute
See Raskind The uncertain case special legislation protecting computer software Pitt

To protect secret developer began distributing product form often relying licensing agreement limit consumer right software

That led however disuse
One common trade provision license well many negotiated license prohibition decompilation disassembly program code
Such provision relied basis software developer assertion notwithstanding mass distribution program program treated unpublished copyrighted work virtually fair use defense raised
Those seek prevent decompilation program tend assert since decompilation involves making unauthorized copy program constitutes improper mean obtaining trade secret program
Under theory decompilation program code result three unlawful act copyright infringement unauthorized copy made decompilation process trade secret misappropriation secret obtained improper mean copyright licensing agreement printed form inserted box containing disc software loaded clear plastic covering box

method solution problem depends solution smaller instance problem opposed
The approach applied many type problem one central idea computer science
The power recursion evidently lie possibility defining infinite set object finite statement
In manner infinite number computation described finite recursive program even program contains explicit repetition
Most computer programming language support recursion allowing call within program text
Some define looping construct rely solely recursion repeatedly call code
prof language computationally powerful Turing complete imperative language meaning solve kind problem imperative language even without iterative control structure
A common tactic divide problem type original solve combine result
This often referred combined store result solving avoid solving repeatedly incurring extra computation time referred
A recursive function definition one meaning input function produce result without recurring one meaning input program recurs call
For example function defined recursively equation
Neither equation constitutes complete definition first base case second recursive case
Because base case break chain recursion sometimes also called terminating case
The job recursive case seen breaking complex input simpler one
In properly designed recursive function recursive call input problem must simplified way eventually base case must reached
Functions intended terminate normal example exception
Neglecting write base case testing incorrectly cause
For function one computes obvious base case implied input data one may add number term added series example provide criterion establishes base case
Such example naturally treated successive term output partial sum converted recursion using indexing parameter say compute th term th partial sum
Many must process generate arbitrarily large quantity
Recursion one technique representing data whose exact size know programmer specify data definition
There two type definition inductive definition
An inductively defined recursive data definition one specifies construct instance data
For example defined inductively using syntax The code specifies list string either empty structure contains string list string
The definition permit construction list finite number string
Another example inductive positive Similarly recursive often used model structure programming language
Language designer often express grammar syntax grammar simple language arithmetic expression multiplication addition This say expression either number product two expression sum two expression

The problem computing first n one solved corecursive program

Recursion contains single known recursion contains multiple known
Standard example single recursion include list traversal linear search computing factorial function standard example multiple recursion include search
Single recursion often much efficient multiple recursion generally replaced iterative computation running linear time requiring constant space
Multiple recursion contrast may require exponential time space fundamentally recursive able replaced iteration without explicit stack
Multiple recursion sometimes converted single recursion desired thence iteration
For example computing Fibonacci sequence naively multiple iteration value requires two previous value computed single recursion passing two successive value parameter
This naturally framed corecursion building initial value tracking step two successive value see
A sophisticated example using allows iterative tree traversal rather multiple recursion
Most basic example recursion example presented demonstrate function call
recursion occurs function called another function called either directly indirectly
For example call direct recursion call call indirect recursion Chains three function possible example function call function function call function function call function
Indirect recursion also called symmetric term though simply difference emphasis different notion
That call call turn call point view alone indirectly recursing point view alone indirectly recursing point view mutually recursing
Similarly set three function call called set mutually recursive function
Recursion usually done explicitly calling function name
However recursion also done via implicitly calling function based current context particularly useful known
Some author classify recursion either structural generative
The distinction related recursive procedure get data work process data Functions consume structured data typically decompose argument immediate structural component process component
If one immediate component belongs class data input function recursive
For reason refer function STRUCTURALLY RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
Thus defining characteristic structurally recursive function argument recursive call content field original input
Structural recursion includes nearly tree traversal including XML processing binary tree creation search etc
By considering algebraic structure natural number natural number either zero successor natural number function factorial may also regarded structural recursion
alternative Many recursive algorithm generate entirely new piece data given data recur
refers kind generative recursion
Examples generative recursion include
This distinction important function
A classic example recursive procedure function used calculate The function also written This evaluation recurrence relation demonstrates computation would performed evaluating pseudocode This factorial function also described without using recursion making use typical looping construct found imperative programming language The imperative code equivalent mathematical definition using accumulator variable The definition translates straightforwardly example iteration implemented recursively
The computes two integer written recursively
Function definition greatest common divisor express The recursive program equivalent iterative algorithm computation shown show step evaluation would performed language eliminates tail call
Below version algorithm using explicit iteration suitable language eliminate tail call
By maintaining state entirely variable using looping construct program avoids making recursive call growing call stack
The iterative algorithm requires temporary variable even given knowledge Euclidean algorithm difficult understand process simple inspection although two algorithm similar step
The Towers Hanoi mathematical puzzle whose solution illustrates recursion
There three peg hold stack disk different diameter
A larger disk may never stacked top smaller
Starting disk one peg must moved another peg one time
What smallest number step move stack

Recursion used algorithm pas new array created cutting old one half
The binary search procedure called recursively time new smaller array
Typically array size adjusted manipulating beginning ending index
The algorithm exhibit logarithmic order growth essentially divide problem domain half pas
Example implementation binary search C An important application recursion computer science defining dynamic data structure
Recursive data structure dynamically grow theoretically infinite size response runtime requirement contrast size static array must set compile time
Recursive algorithm particularly appropriate underlying problem data treated defined recursive term
The example section illustrate known structural recursion
This term refers fact recursive procedure acting data defined recursively
As long programmer derives template data definition function employ structural recursion
That recursion function body consume immediate piece given compound value
Below C definition linked list node structure
Notice especially node defined term
The next element pointer another effectively creating list type
Because data structure defined recursively procedure operate implemented naturally recursive procedure
The procedure defined walk list list empty list pointer value NULL
For node print data element integer
In C implementation list remains unchanged procedure
Below simple definition binary tree node
Like node linked list defined term recursively
There two pointer left pointing left right pointing right
Operations tree implemented using recursion
Note two pointer left right tree operation may require two recursive call At two recursive call made given call defined
The example illustrates binary tree
A special case binary tree data element node order
Since number file may vary practical way traverse thus enumerate content
Traversing filesystem similar therefore concept behind tree traversal applicable traversing filesystem
More specifically code would example filesystem
This code blend line least somewhat recursion
It essentially recursive implementation best way traverse
It also example direct indirect recursion
The method rtraverse purely direct example method traverse indirect call rtraverse
This example need base case scenario due fact always fixed number file directory given filesystem
In actual implementation rather pure recursive function single check base case otherwise recursive step number modification may made purpose clarity efficiency
These include On basis elegance wrapper function generally approved base case frowned upon particularly academia
Hybrid algorithm often used efficiency reduce overhead recursion small case recursion special case
A function directly called recurse instead calling separate auxiliary function actually recursion
Wrapper function used validate parameter recursive function skip perform initialization allocate memory initialize variable particularly auxiliary variable level recursion partial computation handle exception error
In language support auxiliary function nested inside wrapper function use shared scope
In absence nested function auxiliary function instead separate function possible private called directly information shared wrapper function using
base case also known consists checking base case making recursive call checking next call base case instead calling checking base case
particularly done efficiency reason avoid overhead function call immediately return
Note since base case already checked immediately recursive step need checked separately one need use wrapper function case overall recursion start base case
For example factorial function properly base case
immediately returning
may miss mitigated wrapper function
primarily concern many base case encountered Null pointer tree linear number function call hence significant saving algorithm illustrated search
tree corresponds considering leaf node child base case rather considering empty node base case
If single base case computing factorial provides saving
Conceptually considered either base case recursive step checking base case recursion considered different base case one step removed standard base case complex recursive step namely check valid recurse considering leaf node rather Null node base case tree
Because complicated flow compared clear separation base case recursive step standard recursion often considered poor style particularly academia
A basic example given DFS binary tree see section standard recursive discussion
The standard recursive algorithm DFS In instead In term standard step move base case check recursive step
Alternatively considered different form base case recursive step respectively
Note requires wrapper function handle case tree empty root node Null
In case height node Null pointer child leaf cut number function call half worst case
In C standard recursive algorithm may implemented The algorithm may implemented Note use Boolean AND operator recursive call made node valid
Note first term AND pointer node second term bool overall expression evaluates bool
This common idiom recursive
This addition evaluation Boolean OR operator check right child left child fails
In fact entire function replaced single Boolean expression return statement legibility suffers benefit efficiency
Recursive algorithm often inefficient small data due overhead repeated function call return
For reason efficient implementation recursive algorithm often start recursive algorithm switch different algorithm input becomes small
An important example often implemented switching data sufficiently small
Hybrid recursive algorithm often refined derived hybrid merge sort
Recursion iteration equally expressive recursion replaced iteration explicit stack iteration replaced tail recursion
Which approach preferable depends problem consideration language used
In iteration preferred particularly simple recursion avoids overhead function call call stack management recursion generally used multiple recursion
By contrast recursion preferred tail recursion optimization leading little overhead sometimes explicit iteration available
Compare template compute x defined x f n x x For imperative language overhead define function functional language overhead define accumulator variable x
For example factorial function may implemented iteratively C assigning loop index variable accumulator variable rather passing argument returning value recursion Most use today allow direct specification recursive function procedure
When function called program keep track various instance function often using although method may used
Every recursive function transformed iterative function replacing recursive call simulating call stack explicitly managed program
Conversely iterative function procedure evaluated computer see expressed term recursive function iterative control construct routinely rewritten recursive form
However practice rewriting depends feature language
notable mainstream language function call including may cause stack allocation would occur use looping construct language working iterative program rewritten recursive form may although tail call elimination may feature covered language specification different implementation language may differ tail call elimination capability
In language favor iterative looping construct usually significant time space cost associated recursive program due overhead required manage stack relative slowness function call function call particularly typically fast operation difference usually le noticeable
As concrete example difference performance recursive iterative implementation factorial example depends highly compiler used
In language looping construct preferred iterative version may much several order magnitude faster recursive one
In functional language overall time difference two implementation may negligible fact cost multiplying larger number first rather smaller number iterative version given happens may overwhelm time saved choosing iteration
In programming language maximum size much le space available recursive algorithm tend require stack space iterative algorithm
Consequently language sometimes place limit depth recursion avoid stack overflow one language
Note caveat regarding special case
Multiply recursive problem inherently recursive prior state need track
One example contrast list traversal linear search list singly recursive thus naturally iterative
Other example include function
All algorithm implemented iteratively help explicit programmer effort involved managing stack complexity resulting program arguably outweigh advantage iterative solution
function function recursive call hence build deferred operation
For example gcd function shown
In contrast factorial function also recursive call tail position build deferred multiplication operation must performed final recursive call completes
With treat call rather function call function gcd execute using constant space
Thus program essentially iterative equivalent using imperative language control structure like loop
The significance tail recursion making call tail call caller return position need saved recursive call return branch directly previously saved return position
Therefore language recognize property tail call tail recursion save space time
In simple case function calling instruction placed recursive call executed per recursion instruction placed recursive call
The latter executed repeatedly maximum recursion reached
Consider example The recursive algorithm expressed
They usually simplified single term
If function form Then thus represents number recursive call level recursion represents factor smaller input next level recursion
number piece divide problem represents work function independent recursion
partitioning recombining level recursion

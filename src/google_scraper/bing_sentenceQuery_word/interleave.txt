You given array element The task interleave array using algorithm resulting array look like If requirement could easily create new array copy element giving O n time algorithm
With requirement divide conquer algorithm bump algorithm n n
So question Is O n time algorithm also
Note You assume uniform cost WORD RAM model translates O space restriction
Here answer elaborates upon algorithm paper linked Joe First let u consider n n algorithm us divide conquer
We given Now use divide conquer n try get array recurse
Notice portion cyclic shift place
This classic done three reversal O n time
Thus divide conquer give n n algorithm recursion similar T n n
Now another approach problem consider permutation set disjoint cycle
The permutation given assuming starting j If somehow knew exactly cycle using constant extra space could realize permutation picking element A determine element go using formula put element target location temporary space put element A target location continue along cycle
Once done one cycle move onto element next cycle follow cycle
This would give u O n time algorithm assumes somehow knew exact cycle trying within O space limitation make problem hard
This paper us number theory
It shown case element position different cycle every cycle contains element position
This us fact generator Z
Thus follow cycle approach give u O n time algorithm cycle know exactly begin power including computed O space
Now combine two Divide Conquer Permutation Cycles
We divide conquer pick power n
So instead recursing half recurse one n extra work
This give u recurrence T n T cn n c thus give u O n time O space algorithm
I pretty sure I found algorithm rely number theory cycle theory
Note detail work possibly tomorrow I quite confident work
I handwave I supposed sleeping I trying hide problem Let first array second assume simplicity
Let subarray index inclusive
Arrays
Let return position rightmost bit counting right
The algorithm work follows
Let take array number let start interleaving using swap see happens Of particular interest first part second array The pattern clear alternately add number end replace lowest number high number
Note always add number one higher highest number already
If somehow able figure exactly number lowest given time easily
Now go bigger example see see pattern
Note need fix size array construct example
At point get configuration second line subtracts every number Now clearly show pattern apart apart apart
We therefore devise algorithm tell u next smallest number mechanism pretty much exactly binary number work
You bit last half array bit second quarter
If therefore allowed enough space store bit need n bit computational model allows pointer array also need n bit figure number swap O time amortized
We therefore get first half array interleaved state O n time O n swap
However fix second half array seems messed
Now first half second part end recursively interleaving half trick interleave array O n time O n recursive call halve input size
Note need stack call tail recursive space usage remains O
Now question pattern part need sort
Trying number give u fix
Note exact pattern
grouped together fashion saw earlier
Now trick recursively interleave subpart
We interleave
We interleave
We interleave
This sort first part
Just like total cost operation O n
Adding still manage get total running time O n

Learn something new every day email In computer interleaving method writing reading data sequence
Data interleaving used combine multiple digital data stream like file contain audio video
This technique also used memory interleave disk storage used make data read write quickly
A us mapping decipher interleaved data le diagram interleaved pattern computer us decipher data
In medium file interleaving allows player quickly read audio video data
This give user single file contains audio video properly configured read play
Reading interleaved medium file often requires play interleaved file
A codec software tell player read interleaved medium file
The common interleaved medium file type Audio Video Interleave commonly known
Memory interleave process putting one data source effort speed processing
Interleaving usually used hard drive Random Access Memory RAM
While data processed target location next data prepared additional data source data processed first data source load next data line
To understand memory interleave work imagine ride conductor amusement park two elevator hold four ride patron leading entrance ride
He load rider quickly room people line loading area
To get rider onto loading platform conductor assistant bottom elevator accompany group four ride one elevator time
In interleaved system conductor would instruct assistant time departure staggered system designed keep flow rider quick smooth
Similarly interleaved data flow multiple place staggered allow time data source stream data process
One disadvantage memory interleave data transfer cause latency
Latency system time delay
When one data source becomes stopped affect data source using data transfer stream causing slowdown system response
Likewise amusement park ride conductor problem loading one elevator full rider slow line process rider group loaded
In older hard drive interleaved memory used compensate reading slower motor spin
Data written sequence allow hard drive time process data reading
Newer hard drive designed fast enough read data spinning speed eliminating need memory interleaving
One editor review suggestion make change warranted

Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

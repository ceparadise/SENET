A set test input execution condition expected result developed particular objective exercise particular program path verify compliance specific requirement
A test case could simply question ask program
The point running test gain information example whether program pas fail test
Test case cornerstone developed verify quality behavior product
In order fully test requirement application met must least two test case requirement one positive test one negative test
If requirement must least two test case
Keeping track link requirement test frequently done using
Written test case include description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted
A formal written characterized known input expected output worked test executed
The known input test expected output test
For application system without formal requirement test case written based accepted normal operation program similar class
In school testing test case written activity result reported test run
In hypothetical story used help tester think complex problem system
These scenario usually written detail
They simple diagram testing environment could description written prose
The ideal scenario test story motivating credible complex easy evaluate
They usually different test case test case single step scenario cover number step key
A test case usually single step occasionally sequence step test correct feature application
An expected result expected outcome usually given
Additional information may included Larger test case may also contain prerequisite state step description
A written test case also contain place actual result
These step stored word processor document spreadsheet database common repository
In database system may also able see past test result generated result system configuration used generate result
These past result would usually stored separate table
often also contain Besides description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted time consuming part test case creating test modifying system change
Under special circumstance could need run test produce result team expert would evaluate result considered pas
This happens often new product performance number determination
The first test taken base line subsequent test product release cycle
use variation written test case commonly performed group client system ensure developed system meet requirement specified contract
User acceptance test differentiated inclusion positive test case almost complete exclusion negative test case

The test execution time displayed depends whole test case execution includes I need detailed statement execution time businesslogic businesslogic
That I done inside testcase Well
I think I determine time realy awkward way
Furthermore I dont think necessary declare two Date variable
I need advice writing code efficiently unit test I would prefer add timeout Test JUnit annotation determine whether test pass fast enough To determine exact Runtime business logic I would add Time statement right critical Codepath like repeat several time get scholastically correct result remove statement slim code
JUnit introduced
It quite straigthforward use become way verifying time spent test
Here sample class showcasing functionality There useful utility Guava library
This would allow write following By posting answer agree

A test case document set test data precondition expected result postconditions developed particular test scenario order verify compliance specific requirement
Test Case act starting point test execution applying set input value application definitive outcome leaf system end point also known execution postcondition
Test Case ID Test Scenario Test Case Description Test Steps Prerequisite Test Data Expected Result Test Parameters Actual Result Environment Information Comments Let u say need check input field accept maximum character
While developing test case scenario test case documented following way
In example first case pas scenario second case FAIL
If expected result match actual result log defect

In I want able lock Test Case work item modified description step executed execution history record
I problem tester linking test case executed previous release new release modifying test case case substantially product changed
When looking history appears new test executed passed successfully prior release inappropriately
What happen new test case created copy I ca seem enforce rule within system
I need able lock content test case executed I always accurate historical record product tested released
If ever patch old version old test case would still accurate instead test case modified new functionality applicable original version
Any idea
The tester put test case Closed state executed previous release
For new release run test case Ready state

Software Testing Complete Guide Posted In We tester aware various type Software Testing Functional Testing Testing Automation Testing Testing etc
Each u would come across several type testing testing journey
We might heard might worked everyone knowledge testing type
Each type testing feature advantage disadvantage well
However article I covered mostly every type software testing usually use day day testing life
Let go look
What You Will Learn It common type testing used software industry
The objective testing identify possible issue defect releasing market user
Alpha testing carried end software development phase Beta Testing
Still minor design change may made result testing
conducted developer site
virtual user environment created type testing
An acceptance test performed client verifies whether end end flow system per business requirement per need end user
Client accepts software feature functionality work expected
It last phase testing software go production
This also called User Acceptance Testing UAT
The name suggests testing performed basis
reference test case also without plan documentation place type testing
The objective testing find defect break application executing flow application random functionality
testing informal way finding defect performed anyone project
It difficult identify defect without test case sometimes possible defect found testing might identified using existing test case
The aim determine whether software application accessible disabled people
Here disability mean deaf color blind mentally disabled blind old age disabled group
Various check performed font size visually disabled color contrast color blindness etc
It formal type software testing carried customer
It performed releasing product market actual end user
Beta testing carried ensure major failure software product satisfies business requirement perspective
Beta testing successful customer accepts software
Usually testing typically done others
It final testing done releasing application commercial Beta version software product released limited certain number user specific area
So end user actually us software share feedback company
Company take necessary action releasing software worldwide
Whenever input data entered application store database testing database known
There different database like SQL Server MySQL Oracle etc
Database testing involves testing table structure schema stored procedure data structure
In testing GUI involved tester directly connected database proper access tester easily verify data running query database
There issue identified like data loss deadlock data corruption etc testing issue critical fixing system go live production environment It subtype Compatibility Testing explained performed testing team
Browser Compatibility Testing performed web application ensures software run combination different browser operating system
This type testing also validates whether web application run version browser
It type testing validates whether newly developed software updated software work well older version environment
Backward Compatibility Testing check whether new version software work properly file format created older version software also work well data table data file data structure created older version software
If software updated work well top previous version software
Internal system design considered type testing
Tests based requirement functionality
Detailed information advantage disadvantage type Black box testing seen
This type testing check behavior application boundary level
Testing performed checking defect exist boundary value
Boundary value testing used testing different range number
There upper lower boundary range testing performed boundary value
If testing requires test range number Boundary Value Testing performed value
It type white box testing carried unit testing
Branch Testing name suggests code tested thoroughly traversing every branch
Comparison product strength weakness previous version similar product termed Comparison Testing
It testing type validates software behaves run different environment web server hardware network environment
ensures software run different configuration different database different browser version
Compatibility testing performed testing team
It mostly performed developer completion unit testing
Component Testing involves testing multiple functionality single code objective identify defect exists connecting multiple functionality
Similar system testing involves testing complete application environment situation mimic use interacting database using network communication interacting hardware application system appropriate
It testing technique type Black Box Testing
During equivalence partitioning set group selected value number picked testing
It understood value group generate output
The aim testing remove within specific group generates output defect
Suppose application accepts value using equivalence partitioning value picked testing zero one positive value one negative value
So Equivalence Partitioning testing
It mean testing
Example testing includes scenario also involves scenario based experience tester
Exploratory Testing informal testing performed testing team
The objective testing explore application looking defect exist application
Sometimes may happen testing major defect discovered even cause system failure
During exploratory testing advisable keep track flow tested activity start specific flow
performed without documentation test case
This type testing ignores internal part focus output check per requirement
It type testing geared functional requirement application
For detailed information Functional Testing click
The objective GUI testing validate GUI per business requirement
The expected GUI application mentioned Detailed Design Document GUI mockup screen
The GUI testing includes size button input field present screen alignment text table content table
It also validates menu application selecting different menu menu item validates page fluctuate alignment remains hovering mouse menu
Gorilla Testing testing type performed tester sometimes developer well
In Gorilla Testing one module functionality module tested thoroughly heavily
The objective testing check robustness application
The objective Happy Path Testing test application successfully positive flow
It look negative error condition
The focus valid positive input application generates expected output
This approach testing continuous testing application new functionality added
Application functionality module independent enough test separately
This done programmer tester
Testing done full partial upgrade process different operating system different hardware software environment termed
Testing integrated module verify combined functionality integration termed
Modules typically code module individual application client server application network etc
This type testing especially relevant distributed system
It type testing objective Load testing check much load maximum workload system handle without performance degradation
Load testing help find maximum capacity system specific load issue cause software performance degradation
Load testing performed using tool like LoadRunner WebLoad Silk performer etc
Monkey testing carried tester assuming monkey us application random input value entered Monkey without knowledge understanding application
The objective Monkey Testing check application system get crashed providing random input
Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary aware full functionality system
Mutation Testing type white box testing source code one program changed verifies whether existing test case identify defect system
The change program source code minimal impact entire application specific area impact related test case able identify error system
Testers mindset attitude break using negative testing validate system application break
performed using incorrect data invalid data input
It validates system throw error invalid input behaves expected
It type testing every organization separate team usually called Test NFT team Performance team
NFT testing involves testing requirement Load Testing Stress Testing Security Volume Recovery Testing etc
The objective NFT testing ensure whether response time software application quick enough per business requirement
It take much time load page system sustain peak load
This term often used interchangeably stress load testing
done check whether system meet performance requirement
Different performance load tool used testing
It type testing validates well application system recovers crash disaster
Recovery testing determines system able continue operation disaster
Assume application receiving data network cable suddenly network cable unplugged
Sometime later plug network cable system start receiving data lost connection due network cable unplugged
Testing application whole modification module functionality termed Regression Testing
It difficult cover system typically used type testing
In Risk Based Testing functionality requirement tested based priority
testing includes testing highly critical functionality highest impact business probability failure high
The priority decision based business need priority set functionality high priority functionality test case executed first followed medium low priority functionality
The low priority functionality may tested tested based available time
The testing carried insufficient time available test entire software software need implemented time without delay
This approach followed discussion approval client senior management organization
Sanity Testing done determine new software version performing well enough accept major testing effort
If application crashing initial use system stable enough testing
Hence build application assigned fix
It type testing performed special team tester
A system penetrated hacking way
done check software application website secure internal external threat
This testing includes much software secure malicious program virus secure strong authorization authentication process
It also check software behaves hacker attack malicious program software maintained data security hacker attack
Whenever new build provided development team software testing team validates build ensures major issue exists
The testing team ensures build stable detailed level testing carried
check show stopper defect exists build prevent testing team test application detail
If tester find major critical functionality broken initial stage testing team reject build inform accordingly development team
Smoke Testing carried detailed level functional regression testing
Static Testing type testing executed without code
The execution performed documentation testing phase
It involves review walkthrough inspection deliverable project
Static testing execute code instead code syntax naming convention checked
The also applicable test case test plan design document
It necessary perform static testing testing team defect identified type testing project perspective
This testing done system stressed beyond specification order check fails
This performed heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity complex database query continuous input system database load
Under entire system tested per requirement
It type testing based overall requirement specification cover combined part system
Testing individual software component module termed Unit Testing
It typically done programmer tester requires detailed knowledge internal program design code
It may also require developing test driver module test harness
Under testing check done
Application flow tested know new user understand application easily Proper help documented user get stuck point
Basically system navigation checked testing
The testing involves identifying weakness software hardware network known Vulnerability Testing
Malicious program hacker take control system vulnerable kind attack virus worm
So necessary check system undergo Vulnerability Testing production
It may identify critical defect flaw security
It type testing performed performance testing team
The software application undergoes huge amount data Volume Testing check system behavior response time application system came across high volume data
This high volume data may impact system performance speed processing time
This testing based knowledge internal logic application code
It also known Glass box Testing
Internal software code working known performing type testing
Under test based coverage code statement branch path condition etc
For information white box testing type please click
The testing type part testing
However still list type testing testing type used type project
So I covered common Types Software Testing mostly used testing life cycle
Also alternative definition process used different organization basic concept everywhere
These testing type process implementation method keep changing project requirement scope change
valuable information type testing Thanks Namita Actually I planning detail description type later thought big mess single post
I take one type time future posting
usefull software tester student alpha testing beta testing sequrity usefull thanking u I need sample general checklist detailed checklist need create control chart
It really good
It simple giving good idea
Hello question real time founding bug send developer developer asks clear step better understanding bug sending also unable understand status given developer situation
THIS INFERMATION IS
I NEED FULL INFERMATION ABOUT MERCURY QUALITY U SEND IT

The information provided u really helping
Can u give information java testing
hai This reply answer
Typically know basic knowledge testing mean knowledge enough kind software testing
difference functional testing systemtesting Naga Vishala In case developer might ask bug reporter detail bug make status bug Need Info Thilak The answer NO
Think development If theoretical knowledge programming language say write program using language
No must knowledge
If basic knowledge software testing enough testing type
You gain knowledge type using basic knowledge
chengaiah Functional testing black box testing without considering program structure
You verify program using specification document
System testing end end application testing includes whole application one unit generally tested usability functionality performance load

Hi Meenu Can u please tell r question ask interview
also planning attend interview
experience
u share question help
Friends Could please throw light testing us
role Independent Path Unit testing real time
phase SDLC testing
hello friend Can tell specifide result project testing
Folks Lot people asking difference Smoke Sanity testing
And info get confused people becoming
Let make simple Difference Smoke Sanity Smoke testing done verify build tested done properly
The build new updated version software
The motive check application build working fine crash
For example say application following feature say feature page case feature page Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Smoke Test Check page displayed properly broken link page
Check button page clickable disabled hidden
Check traverse back forth page
Check see help section page legal disclaimer section page outgoing link page Check look feel page font user text box displayed properly broken image cluttered text font scramble optional check unless see something unreadable Check able enter info input box need transaction check whether able input text page
Note required transaction Smoke test
In word testing functionality application application build
Sanity Testing done verify whether new updated build functioning properly
Note difference smoke check application build sanity check build functionality higher level
Take example say application following feature Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Sanity Test Check customer critical functionality working performing least one transaction major feature
Your depth sanity testing depends functionality application
Say major feature application
So need perform one transaction feature verify major feature working properly
Sanity test concentrate testing major feature
A feature said major accessed customer frequently daily working important business
Now say login logout enter info delete info generate record main feature application
Sanity test Check able login Check able logout Check able enter info save record new user
Check able delete data existing user
Check generate report current date
You need test rest feature
Nor require run exhaustive test case major feature
Note check basic functioning major feature working
Don run end end multiple operation test case sanity
Just ran Basic test case feature designed
Hope everyone got clear understanding Smoke Sanity testing
And Difference Well

Or dont u download free
call mail Present working software company data tool use company open source tool effective testing tool tell effective tool evailble open source
test plan write properly
Hi I got lot info
The defn testing type ready HI EVERY ONE TELL ME HOW TO WRITE TEST CASE
eg like mobile fan etc plese ergnt A test plan base line testing activity A test plan address
When
And
Test planning ass software application risk develops plan determine software minimizes risk Testers must understand development method environment effectively plan testing The tester must understand new increased risk order evaluate control computer application The test plan focused identified risk An Ideal Test Plan comprise Test Scope Test Objective Assumptions Risk Analysis Test Design Roles Responsibilities Test Schedule Resources Test Data Management Test Environment Communication Approach Test Tools Vijay In article End End testing explained wrong
The name give exact definition
Say Example ATM transaction End End testing test performed inserting card get cash reciept card
That mean entire functioniality application input output know End To End Testing
Cheers george ya completely agree George
System Testing called end end testing scratch application entire functionality application every part application checked ita proper functionality
In actual testing final phase testing entire application tested functionality prior User Acceptance Testing
Hi back
This time info System testing people seem
You may asked question interview System testing
What difference Functional System Testing
Functional Testing Everyone know I going explain keep short test functionality software product functional testing
All feature transaction checked functional The common type testing
System Testing Like must read comment End End type testing
mean
You test software right login till
Test everything system testing
M kidding
Then system
It mean check system
Check functionally well Check functionality functional testing
Check requirement like Usability Accessibility Compatibility Localization Performance I recall rest In short supposed test everything kind testing System testing
That called One liner definition system testing To make simple system testing check functional well requirement software
Functional requirement affect product directly like feature whereas requirement affect product like page load time compatibility different browser user friendliness localization
So important check requirement well
Hope everyone clear Lets make Cheers Sameer K meant database testing
done real time
dear friend Computer science working lecturer CS
I interesting working programming testing
For shifter present career new field stftware testing
learing thing testing
please help fresher jon testing
thanks DB Testing Hi shreya I idea database real time base supoose u testing Payroll System Payslip
u wil enter data like employee name basicsalary empId outerface design u enter data base check data insert database properly time data insert wrong manner becase u must check database every module u chek compare databse
Hope u idea plese replay Cheers PHALGUNA Hi shreya I idea database real time base supoose u testing Payroll System Payslip
u wil enter data like employee name basicsalary empId outerface design u enter data base check data insert database properly time data insert wrong manner becase u must check database every module u check compare databse
Hope u idea plese replay Cheers PHALGUNA well explanation sameer
I confustion cheer jk Hi phalguna Thanks ur reply I need extra info db testing I know like entering data outer interface checking database
I heard need perform I wanted know wtelse thing mentioned happen db hai Plz one tell difference stress load testing example Hi All Here difference see SMOKE TESTING Smoke testing originated hardware testing practice turning new piece hardware first time considering success catch fire smoke
In software industry smoke testing shallow wide approach whereby area application without getting deep tested
A smoke test using written set test automated test A Smoke test designed touch every part application cursory way
It shallow wide
Smoke testing conducted ensure whether crucial function program work bothering finer detail
Such build verification
Smoke testing normal health check build application taking testing depth
SANITY TESTING A sanity test narrow regression test focus one area functionality
Sanity testing usually narrow deep
A sanity test usually unscripted
A Sanity test used determine small section application still working minor change
Sanity testing cursory testing performed whenever cursory testing sufficient prove application functioning according specification
This level testing subset regression testing
sanity testing verify whether requirement met checking feature
Hope Regards VijayD Great I got type testing

Thanks Suresh Hi Shreya This Suresh Working Test Engineer
mention Database Testing link given Below Data ba testing basically include following
Data validity testing
Data Integritity testing Performance related data base
Testing Procedure trigger function
data validity testing good SQL query For data integrity testing know referintial integrity different constraint
For performance related thing idea table structure design
testing Procedure trigger function able understand
Thanks Suresh Hi All This Suresh Working Test Engineer
mentioned Difference Load Stress Volume Testing given Below Load Stress Volume testing part Performence testing
Load Testing Load Testing gauge efficently application performs function tested varying workload
Stress Testing Stress Testing look see well software reacts compensates resource low
Volume Testing Volume Testing test functional limit application increasing amount data thrown untill longer cope flow
Thanks Suresh Hi Renuka This Suresh Working Test Engineer
mentioned Regression Testing given Below What Regression Testing
Introduction This article attempt take close look process technique Regression Testing
What Regression Testing
If piece Software modified reason testing need done ensure work specified negatively impacted functionality offered previously
This known Regression Testing
Regression Testing attempt verify That application work specified even made The original functionality continues work specified even software application The software application introduced new bug When Regression Testing necessary
Regression Testing play important role Scenario change made previously tested software code
Regression Testing hence important aspect various Software Methodologies software change enhancement occur frequently
Any Software Development Project invariably faced request changing Design code feature
Some Development Methodologies embrace change
For example Extreme Programming Methodology advocate applying small incremental change system based end user feedback
Each change implies Regression Testing need done ensure System meet Project Goals
Why Regression Testing important
Any Software change cause existing functionality break
Changes Software component could impact dependent Components
It commonly observed Software fix could cause bug
All affect quality reliability system
Hence Regression Testing since aim verify important
Making Regression Testing Cost Effective Every time change occurs one following scenario may occur More Functionality may added system More complexity may added system New bug may introduced New vulnerability may introduced system System may tend become fragile change After change new functionality may tested along original functionality

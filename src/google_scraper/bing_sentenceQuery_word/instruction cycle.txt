An sometimes called basic operational process computer
It process computer retrieves determines action instruction dictate carry action
This cycle repeated continuously computer CPU computer shut
In simpler CPUs instruction cycle executed sequentially instruction processed next one started
In modern CPUs instruction cycle instead executed often next instruction start processed previous instruction finished possible cycle broken separate step
Each computer CPU different cycle based different instruction set similar following cycle The cycle repeated
The cycle begin soon power applied system initial PC value predefined system architecture instance Intel CPUs predefined PC value
Typically address point set instruction ROM begin process loading
Step instruction cycle fetch cycle instruction The control unit fetch instruction address
Step instruction Cycle called Decode Cycle
The decoding process allows CPU determine instruction performed CPU tell many operand need fetch order perform instruction
The opcode fetched memory decoded next step moved appropriate register
The decoding done
Step evaluating operation
If Memory operation step computer check direct indirect memory operation If Register instruction computer check kind executes instruction
Step Instruction Cycle Execute Cycle
Here function instruction performed
If instruction involves arithmetic logic Arithmetic Logic Unit utilized
This stage instruction cycle useful perspective end user
Everything else overhead required make execute phase happen

I reading various phase I found three phase like
Now part I understand need decode phase
The instruction already stored binary format memory location fetch execute
As say instruction binary format say I actually check number bit
Can execute
Well easy somewhere description instruction set including CPU architecture encoded binary
You understand sequence bit organized specifies instruction argument register involved may depend instruction
Once sorted information pas control specialized circuitry supposed actually perform instruction say addition data register decoded
For different instruction pas control data different circuitry
It like team game
There often one guy whose role dispatch ball appropriate player decoding next step game
Well bit far fetched
In CPU specific circuitry decodes instruction
The name decoding actually bit misleading thing take place stage
You view translation external representation instruction CPU internal interpretation
All CPU architecture encoding instruction usually involving specification number specifying action instruction opposed argument might register memory location etc
Note number often byte
For instance addition instruction might byte value subtraction might
However note numbering somewhat arbitrary
It say instruction something would look instruction manual
What decoding stage map number actual instruction
This often involves looking instance ROM
You could compare decode stage looking manual see instruction actually
Now instruction manual written language
What computer manual written
One method used many implementation ROM map value specifies control signal must sent execution pipeline cause action executed
For instance instruction involves looking value register adding storing result another register ROM contain value control signal command register bank read mode ALU addition mode
The detail control signal course implementation dependent depending CPU internally function control signal various internal unit accepts
However point decode stage map representation instruction form actual action form control signal
Note many architecture one instruction might actually decoded several essentially long word control signal
This allows architecture provide application programmer complex instruction short encoding
This generating sequencing might also take place decode stage
Now could ask let instruction contain control signal
In case decode stage might necessary
Only problem execution instruction often involves lot control signal meaning instruction would long got
Also would expose internal working CPU since external representation instruction would deeply tied internal working
By way architecture complicated encoding scheme decoding involves lot work lookup ROM fact rather complicated logic determine length prefix etc
instruction
Also various trick might necessary keep ROM acceptable size also allow fast
On superscalar instruction even possible several instruction parallel even encoding variable length instruction
So see decoder pretty busy
Download manual modern processor example Look instruction format
And tell straight face execute
Just fun try write function given array byte containing instruction processor bit mode return length instruction byte
Enjoy challenge
But real reason decoder needed Instruction set designed year past year go seemed good idea year ago good idea today
In typical modern processor instruction described instruction set manual translated quite different instruction processor actually executes
Some instruction translated pair processor instruction
Sometimes multiple instruction combined single processor instruction
Sometimes instruction get executed instruction decoder keep track effect adjusts following instruction
This allows maker processor change internal instruction set without affecting program written processor

An abstract model
It also referred
A realization ISA called
An ISA permit multiple implementation may vary physical size monetary cost among thing ISA serf
Software written ISA run different implementation ISA
This enabled different generation computer easily achieved development computer family
Both development helped lower cost computer increase applicability
For reason ISA one important abstraction today
An ISA defines everything need know order program computer
What ISA defines differs ISAs general ISAs define supported state semantics set comprises computer machine language model
An instruction set architecture distinguished set technique used particular processor implement instruction set
Processors different microarchitectures share common instruction set
For example implement nearly identical version radically different internal design
The concept distinct design specific machine developed IBM design phase
Prior NPL company computer designer free honor cost objective selecting technology also fashioning functional architectural refinement
The SPREAD compatibility objective contrast postulated single architecture series five processor spanning wide range cost performance
None five engineering design team could count able bring adjustment architectural specification way easing difficulty achieving cost performance objective
Some support ISA Microsoft implement translating bytecode commonly used code path native machine code
In addition virtual machine execute le frequently used code path interpretation see
implemented instruction set atop processor fashion
An ISA may classified number different way
A common classification architectural
A CISC many specialized instruction may rarely used practical program
A RISC simplifies processor efficiently implementing instruction frequently used program le common operation implemented subroutine resulting additional processor execution time offset infrequent use
Other type include VLIW architecture closely related LIW EPIC architecture
These architecture seek exploit le hardware RISC CISC making responsible instruction issue scheduling
Architectures even le complexity studied MISC OISC
These theoretically important type commercialized
built discrete
On processing architecture given instruction may specify More complex operation built combining simple instruction executed sequentially otherwise directed instruction
Examples operation common many instruction set include Processors may include complex instruction instruction set
A single complex instruction something may take many instruction computer
Such instruction instruction take multiple step control multiple functional unit otherwise appear larger scale bulk simple instruction implemented given processor
Some example complex instruction include Complex instruction common CISC instruction set RISC instruction set RISC instruction set may include well
RISC instruction set generally include ALU operation memory operand instruction move large block memory RISC instruction set include instruction perform arithmetic operation multiple piece data time
SIMD instruction ability manipulating large vector matrix minimal time
SIMD instruction allow easy algorithm commonly involved sound image video processing
Various SIMD implementation brought market trade name
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifies operation perform zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In VLIW architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous opcodes operand specified single instruction
Some exotic instruction set opcode field TTA operand
The instruction set lack operand specifier field including NOSC
Conditional instruction often predicate bit encode specific condition cause operation performed rather performed
For example conditional branch instruction executed branch taken condition true execution proceeds different part program executed branch taken condition false execution continues sequentially
Some instruction set also conditional move move executed data stored target location condition true executed target location modified condition false
Similarly IBM conditional store instruction
A instruction set include predicate field every instruction called
The size length instruction varies widely little four bit many hundred bit VLIW system
Processors used instruction size bit
The longest possible instruction byte bit
Within instruction set different instruction may different length
In architecture notably RISC typically corresponding architecture
In architecture instruction variable length typically integral multiple
Some variable encoding two fixed usually encoding instruction mixed freely must switched branch exception boundary
A RISC instruction set normally fixed instruction length often byte bit whereas typical CISC instruction set may instruction widely varying length byte
instruction le complicated handle instruction several reason check whether instruction straddle cache line virtual memory page boundary instance therefore somewhat easier optimize speed
The instruction constituting program rarely specified using internal numeric form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
The design instruction set complex issue
There two stage history microprocessor
The first CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer many different instruction
In however place like IBM research found many instruction set could eliminated
The result RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture us smaller set instruction
A simpler instruction set may offer potential higher speed reduced processor size reduced power consumption
However complex set may optimize common operation improve memory efficiency simplify programming
Some instruction set designer reserve one opcodes kind
For example us us eight code CF DF EF FF use code range
Fast virtual machine much easier implement instruction set meet
The used much easier implement unprogrammed state memory interpreted
On system multiple processor algorithm much easier implement instruction set includes support something atomic
Any given instruction set implemented variety way
All way implementing particular instruction set provide implementation instruction set able run executables
The various way implementing instruction set give different tradeoff cost performance power consumption size etc
When designing processor engineer use block electronic circuitry often designed separately adder multiplexer counter register ALUs etc
Some kind often used describe decoding sequencing instruction ISA using physical microarchitecture
There two basic way build implement description although many design use middle way compromise Some design use combination hardwired design microcode control unit
Some CPU design use compile instruction set writable inside CPU processor FPGA
An ISA also software
Naturally due interpretation overhead slower directly running program emulated hardware unless hardware running emulator order magnitude faster
Today common practice vendor new ISAs microarchitectures make software emulator available software developer hardware implementation ready
Often detail implementation strong influence particular instruction selected instruction set
For example many implementation allow single memory load memory store per instruction leading RISC
For another example early way implementing led
The demand digital signal processing pushed opposite instruction implemented particular way
For example perform digital filter fast enough MAC instruction typical DSP must use kind fetch instruction two data word simultaneously requires
In early computer memory expensive minimizing size program make sure would fit limited memory often central
Thus combined size instruction needed perform particular task important characteristic instruction set
Computers high code density often complex instruction procedure entry parameterized return loop etc
therefore retroactively named
However typical frequent CISC instruction merely combine basic ALU operation add access one operand memory using direct indirect indexed etc
Certain architecture may allow two three operand including result directly memory may able perform function automatic pointer increment etc
instruction set may even complex powerful instruction
first widely implemented period rapidly growing memory subsystem
They sacrifice code density simplify implementation circuitry try increase performance via higher clock frequency register
A single RISC instruction typically performs single operation add register load memory location register
A RISC instruction set normally fixed whereas typical CISC instruction set instruction widely varying length
However RISC computer normally require often longer instruction implement given task inherently make le optimal use bus bandwidth cache memory
Certain embedded RISC ISAs like typically exhibit high density owing technique called code compression
This technique pack two instruction one instruction unpacked decode stage executed two instruction
MISC form separate instruction multiple instruction fit single machine word
These type core often take little silicon implement easily realized form
The code density MISC similar code density RISC increased instruction density offset requiring primitive instruction task
There research mechanism improving code density
The mathematics describes challenge limit
Instruction set may categorized maximum number operand specified instruction
In example follow direct calculated address referring memory cell refer machine register
Due large number bit needed encode three register instruction RISC architecture instruction invariably design Atmel AVR version
RISC architecture instruction usually design architecture
Each instruction specifies number operand register memory location immediate value
Some instruction give one operand implicitly stored top implicit register
If operand given implicitly fewer operand need specified instruction
When destination operand explicitly specifies destination additional operand must supplied
Consequently number operand encoded instruction may differ mathematically necessary number argument logical arithmetic operation
Operands either encoded opcode representation instruction else given value address following instruction
measure availability free register point time program execution
Register pressure high large number available register use thus higher register pressure often register content must memory
Increasing number register architecture decrease register pressure increase cost
While embedded instruction set suffer extremely high register pressure small register set RISC ISAs like enjoy low register pressure
CISC ISAs like offer low register pressure despite smaller register set
This due many addressing mode optimization addressing memory operand ALU instruction absolute addressing addressing spill CISC ISAs offer

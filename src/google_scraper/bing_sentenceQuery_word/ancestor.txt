Suppose I What fast algorithm constructing complete family tree using information
family forest everyone may related single common ancestor
This homework book
It derived issue I coupling adaptive finite element code blackbox mesh generation software boiled core problem expressed analogy share mathematical structure
Right I O method seems horribly inefficient
Thank help
I implemented Gilles suggestion Matlab tested
Here pseudocode code unit test script
I release public domain
We finite set D person relation x mean x
This relation following property Let given data structure following operation defined We also use data structure node contains person set child
If tree write person root node set child
A set tree
We start empty forest add person one one
At step relationship forest relationship ancestor relation
We define recursive function insert tree forest
forest F tree none element tree related person F
Let x
First check whether x ancestor existing person split set F according property x F
Let C subset F consisting descendant x root tree descendant x element also descendant transitivity F remaining subset
By antisymmetry none person C ancestor x
None element related person C assumption
Let u tree root person x set child root C
By chain assumption x ancestor one tree F
Iterate tree F determine one ancestor x root splitting operation one set guaranteed contain one element
Start empty forest iteratively graft person D grafting person mean grafting tree person root child
From remark algorithm easy prove recursive call graft valid relative node tree inserted inside tree x ancestor tree iff x
graft F performs n ancestor test n number person F one test per root F one test per root descendant new node test performed recursive call applies subset F including root
The complexity operation linear number ancestor test performed
Therefore forest construction algorithm performs n ancestor test n total number person
In fact easy see never performs test twice
The overall complexity therefore O
In worst case possible n test performed
This happens two person related unavoidable case
follows somewhat informal description O algorithm build dag V E expressing ancestor relation subsequently thin family tree
dag node person involved edge shall represent ancestor relationship u v E u ancestor v
let n
step build transitive closure ancestor relation iterating pair candidate adding u v E iff
complexity O
step determine source node dag
source node represent minimal element ancestor relation seen partial order
note exactly source node per connected component since consider ancestor among sex
thus edge ending given node v actually forward edge introduced transitive closure underlying family tree
step actually implemented part step counting incoming edge visited node adding node v indeg v heap deleting node indeg v heap
completion step heap contains node indeg ie
source node
node max inserted deleted heap step contributes O n n
step perform depth first search tha dag starting source node
node visited first time record distance current source node immediate predecessor current dfs root path
node visited current root path length greater recorded node set length immediate predecessor value current dfs path delete recorded edge dag
dfs finished dag reduced family forest
every edge visited max complexity O E
step work dag contain crossing edge
therefore given pair u v V never different path u v equal length
summary O O n n O E O By posting answer agree

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

I wondering consensus definition ancestor computer science context
I ask Second Edition description algorithm seems odd
In finding successor node right subtree node empty successor lowest ancestor whose left child also ancestor
In binary search tree root key child successor parent
In case left child successor
According book definition must ancestor unless I missing something
I found anything
It merely matter definition case
CLRS define ancestor x node unique path root x definition includes x
The sentence fragment quoted begin mentioning exercise next page specifies Recall every node ancestor
Is node tree considered ancestor
Not normally AFAIK
For example Wikipedia page defined thus If path exists node p node q node p closer root node q p ancestor q q descendant But apparently text book definition node ancestor
This definition exactly intuitive textbook free introduce definition terminology us
Maybe definition simplifies related description theorem etc
No node ancestor
According right subtree node x empty x successor lowest ancestor x whose left child code given book supposedly handling type case

Im trying understand various definition student quite agree
My definition please correct wrong Base class top class hierarchy
Super Ancestor class class higher hierarchy including base class Parent class next class hierarchy
Yes
direct superclass one level hierarchy class
Depending programming language class multiple parent
While ancestor class superclass class parent class parent parent class
According base class class another class inherits one property method
If accept definition mean super ancestor parent base class synonymous term describing relationship class particular

In two node DAG lowest
deepest node descendant define node descendant direct connection lowest common ancestor
The LCA shared ancestor located farthest root
Computation lowest common ancestor may useful instance part procedure determining distance pair node tree distance computed distance root plus distance root minus twice distance root lowest common ancestor
In lowest common ancestor also known
In node point parent lowest common ancestor easily determined finding first intersection path root
In general computational time required algorithm height tree length longest path leaf root
However exist several algorithm processing tree lowest common ancestor may found quickly
example preprocesses tree linear time provide LCA query
In general DAGs similar algorithm exist complexity
The lowest common ancestor problem defined Dov Harel first develop optimally efficient lowest common ancestor data structure
Their algorithm process tree linear time using subsequent lowest common ancestor query may answered constant time per query
However data structure complex difficult implement
Tarjan also found simpler le efficient algorithm based data structure
Baruch Schieber simplified data structure Harel Tarjan leading implementable structure asymptotic preprocessing query time bound
Their simplification based principle two special kind tree lowest common ancestor easy determine tree path lowest common ancestor computed simply minimum level two queried node tree node may indexed way lowest common ancestor reduce simple binary operation index
The structure Schieber Vishkin decomposes tree collection path connection path structure binary tree combine two simpler indexing technique
Omer Berkman Uzi Vishkin discovered completely new way answer lowest common ancestor query achieving linear preprocessing time constant query time
Their method involves forming graph formed input tree doubling every edge using tour write sequence level number node order tour visit lowest common ancestor query transformed query seek minimum value occurring within subinterval sequence number
They handle problem combining two technique one technique based precomputing answer large interval size power two based table lookup query
This method later presented simplified form Michael Bender
As previously observed range minimum problem turn transformed back lowest common ancestor problem using technique
Further simplification made
A variant problem dynamic LCA problem data structure prepared handle LCA query intermixed operation change tree rearrange tree adding removing edge This variant solved using O logN time modification query
This done maintaining forest using dynamic tree data structure partitioning size maintains decomposition tree allows LCA query carried logarithmic time size tree
Without preprocessing also improve naïve online algorithm computation time O log storing path tree using random access list still permitting tree extended constant time
This allows LCA query carried logarithmic time height tree
While originally studied context tree notion lowest common ancestor defined directed acyclic graph DAGs using either two possible definition
In edge DAG assumed point parent child
In tree lowest common ancestor unique DAG node pair node may much LCAs existence LCA pair node even guaranteed arbitrary connected DAGs
A algorithm finding lowest common ancestor given find ancestor return maximum element intersection two set
Better algorithm exist analogous LCA algorithm tree preprocess graph enable LCA query
The problem solved optimally sparse DAGs mean algorithm due
present unified framework Directed Acyclic Graphs DAGs compute least upper bound two vertex constant time
Their framework us adaptive asymptotic cost depend number cross edge DAG
Consequently possible achieve time sparse DAGs constant time LCA
A library work available public use
present method extends computation LCA disjunctive ancestor semantic similarity measure
He defines ancestor disjunctive difference number distinct path two node ancestor different using lower common ancestor
The problem computing lowest common ancestor class arises implementation system
The LCA problem also find application model found

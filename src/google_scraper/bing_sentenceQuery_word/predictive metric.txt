In business predictive model exploit found historical transactional data identify risk opportunity
Models capture relationship among many factor allow assessment risk potential associated particular set condition guiding candidate transaction
The defining functional effect technical approach predictive analytics provides predictive score probability individual customer employee healthcare patient product SKU vehicle component machine organizational unit order determine inform influence organizational process pertain across large number individual marketing credit risk assessment fraud detection manufacturing healthcare government operation including law enforcement
Predictive analytics used field
One application used throughout
Scoring model process customer customer data order individual likelihood making future credit payment time
Predictive analytics area statistic deal data using predict behavior pattern
Often unknown event interest future predictive analytics applied type unknown whether past present future
For example identifying suspect crime committed credit card fraud occurs
The core predictive analytics relies capturing relationship predicted variable past occurrence exploiting predict unknown outcome
It important note however accuracy usability result depend greatly level data analysis quality assumption
Predictive analytics often defined predicting detailed level granularity generating predictive score probability individual organizational element
This distinguishes forecasting
For example Predictive learns experience data predict future behavior individual order drive better decision
In future industrial system value predictive analytics predict prevent potential issue achieve integrated decision optimization
Furthermore converted data used product life cycle improvement vision
Generally term predictive analytics used mean scoring data predictive model
However people increasingly using term refer related analytical discipline descriptive modeling decision modeling optimization
These discipline also involve rigorous data analysis widely used business segmentation decision making different purpose statistical technique underlying vary
model relation specific performance unit sample one known attribute feature unit
The objective model ass likelihood similar unit different sample exhibit specific performance
This category encompasses model many area marketing seek subtle data pattern answer question customer performance fraud detection model
Predictive model often perform calculation live transaction example evaluate risk opportunity given customer transaction order guide decision
With advancement computing speed individual agent modeling system become capable simulating human behaviour reaction given stimulus scenario
The available sample unit known attribute known performance referred training sample
The unit sample known attribute unknown performance referred training sample unit
The sample unit necessarily bear chronological relation training sample unit
For example training sample may consist literary attribute writing Victorian author known attribution sample unit may newly found writing unknown authorship predictive model may aid attributing work known author
Another example given analysis blood splatter simulated crime scene sample unit actual blood splatter pattern crime scene
The sample unit may time training unit previous time future time
Descriptive model quantify relationship data way often used classify customer prospect group
Unlike predictive model focus predicting single customer behavior credit risk descriptive model identify many different relationship customer product
Descriptive model customer likelihood taking particular action way predictive model
Instead descriptive model used example categorize customer product preference life stage
Descriptive modeling tool utilized develop model simulate large number individualized agent make prediction
describe relationship element known data including result predictive model decision forecast result order predict result decision involving many variable
These model used optimization maximizing certain outcome minimizing others
Decision model generally used develop decision logic set business rule produce desired action every customer circumstance
Although predictive analytics put use many application outline example predictive analytics shown positive impact recent year

Proper predictive analytics lead proper pricing decision help mitigate future risk default
collection data set large complex become awkward work using traditional tool
The volume variety velocity big data introduced challenge across board capture storage search sharing analysis visualization
Examples big data source include data Internet search indexing call detail record military surveillance complex data astronomic biogeochemical genomics atmospheric science
Big Data core predictive analytic service offered IT organization
Thanks technological advance computer CPUs cheaper memory new technology processing big data feasible collect analyze mine massive amount structured new insight
It also possible run predictive algorithm streaming data
Today exploring big data using predictive analytics within reach organization ever new method capable handling datasets proposed
The approach technique used conduct predictive analytics broadly grouped regression technique machine learning technique
model mainstay predictive analytics
The focus lie establishing mathematical equation model represent interaction different variable consideration
Depending situation wide variety model applied performing predictive analytics
Some briefly discussed
The analyzes relationship response dependent variable set independent predictor variable
This relationship expressed equation predicts response variable linear function parameter
These parameter adjusted measure fit optimized
Much effort model fitting focused minimizing size residual well ensuring randomly distributed respect model prediction
The goal regression select parameter model minimize sum squared residual
This referred OLS estimation result best linear unbiased estimate BLUE parameter assumption satisfied
Once model estimated would interested know predictor variable belong
estimate variable contribution reliable
To check statistical significance model coefficient measured using
This amount testing whether coefficient significantly different zero
How well model predicts dependent variable based value independent variable assessed using statistic
It measure predictive power model
proportion total variation dependent variable explained accounted variation independent variable
Multiple regression generally used response variable continuous unbounded range
Often response variable may continuous rather discrete
While mathematically feasible apply multiple regression discrete ordered dependent variable assumption behind theory multiple linear regression longer hold technique discrete choice model better suited type analysis
If dependent variable discrete superior method model
Logistic regression probit model used dependent variable
In classification setting assigning outcome probability observation achieved use logistic model basically method transforms information binary dependent variable unbounded continuous variable estimate regular multivariate model See Allison information theory logistic regression
The used test statistical significance coefficient model analogous test used OLS regression see
A test assessing classification model percentage correctly predicted
An extension case dependent variable category
In case collapsing data two category might make good sense may lead loss richness data
The multinomial logit model appropriate technique case especially dependent variable category ordered example color like red blue green
Some author extended multinomial regression include feature method
offer alternative logistic regression modeling categorical dependent variable
Even though outcome tend similar underlying distribution different
Probit model popular social science like economics
A good way understand key difference probit logit model assume dependent variable driven latent variable z sum linear combination explanatory variable random noise term
We observe z instead observe take value z otherwise
In logit model assume random noise term follows mean zero
In probit model assume follows normal distribution mean zero
Note social science
economics probit often used model situation observed variable continuous take value
The around longer
They behave similarly except tends slightly flatter tailed
One reason logit model formulated probit model computationally difficult due requirement numerically calculating integral
Modern computing however made computation fairly simple
The coefficient obtained logit probit model fairly close
However easier interpret logit model
Practical reason choosing probit model logistic model would model used predicting forecasting future behavior variable
These model account fact data point taken time may internal structure autocorrelation trend seasonal variation accounted
As result standard regression technique applied time series data methodology developed decompose trend seasonal cyclical component series
Modeling dynamic path variable improve forecast since predictable component series projected future
Time series model estimate difference equation containing stochastic component
Two commonly used form model AR MA model
The methodology developed George Box
Jenkins combine AR MA model produce autoregressive moving average model cornerstone stationary time series analysis
autoregressive integrated moving average model hand used describe time series
Box Jenkins suggest differencing time series obtain stationary series ARMA model applied
time series pronounced trend constant mean variance
Box Jenkins proposed methodology involving model identification estimation validation
The identification stage involves identifying series stationary presence seasonality examining plot series autocorrelation partial autocorrelation function
In estimation stage model estimated using time series maximum likelihood estimation procedure
Finally validation stage involves diagnostic checking plotting residual detect outlier evidence model fit
In recent year time series model become sophisticated attempt model conditional heteroskedasticity model ARCH GARCH generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model frequently used financial time series
In addition time series model also used understand among economic variable represented system equation using VAR vector autoregression structural VAR model
another name analysis
These technique primarily developed medical biological science also widely used social science like economics well engineering reliability failure time analysis
Censoring characteristic survival data generate difficulty trying analyze data using conventional statistical model multiple
The symmetric distribution take positive well negative value duration nature negative therefore normality assumed dealing data
Hence normality assumption regression model violated
The assumption data censored would representative population interest
In survival analysis censored observation arise whenever dependent variable interest represents time terminal event duration study limited time
An important concept survival analysis defined probability event occur time conditional surviving time Another concept related hazard rate survival function defined probability surviving time Most model try model hazard rate choosing underlying distribution depending shape hazard function
A distribution whose hazard function slope upward said positive duration dependence decreasing hazard show negative duration dependence whereas constant hazard process memory usually characterized exponential distribution
Some distributional choice survival model F gamma Weibull log normal inverse normal exponential etc
All distribution random variable
Duration model parametric
Some model commonly used Cox proportional hazard model non parametric
classification tree analysis also called hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis generalization may used identify statistical model maximum accuracy predicting value categorical dependent variable dataset consisting categorical continuous variable
The output HODA tree combine categorical variable cut point continuous variable yield maximum predictive accuracy assessment exact Type I error rate evaluation potential statistical model
Hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis may thought generalization Fisher linear discriminant analysis
Optimal discriminant analysis alternative ANOVA analysis variance regression analysis attempt express one dependent variable linear combination feature measurement
However ANOVA regression analysis give dependent variable numerical variable hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis give dependent variable class variable
Classification regression tree CART technique produce either classification regression tree depending whether dependent variable categorical numeric respectively
formed collection rule based variable modeling data set Each branch tree end terminal node
Each observation fall one exactly one terminal node terminal node uniquely defined set rule
A popular method predictive analytics Leo Breiman
MARS technique build flexible model fitting
An important concept associated knot
Knot one local regression model give way another thus point intersection two spline
In multivariate adaptive regression spline tool used generalizing search knot
Basis function set function used represent information contained one variable
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines model almost always creates basis function pair
Multivariate adaptive regression spline approach deliberately model prune get optimal model
The algorithm computationally intensive practice required specify upper limit number basis function
branch artificial intelligence originally employed develop technique enable computer learn
Today since includes number advanced statistical method regression classification find application wide variety field including detection analysis
In certain application sufficient directly predict dependent variable without focusing underlying relationship variable
In case underlying relationship complex mathematical form dependency unknown
For case machine learning technique emulate human learn training example predict future event

They commonly use kernel based method apply linear classification technique classification problem
There number type SVM linear polynomial sigmoid etc
based Bayes conditional probability rule used performing classification task
Naïve Bayes assumes predictor statistically independent make effective classification tool easy interpret
It best employed faced problem
number predictor high
The KNN belongs class pattern recognition statistical method
The method impose priori assumption distribution modeling sample drawn
It involves training set positive negative value
A new sample classified calculating distance nearest neighbouring training case
The sign point determine classification sample
In neighbour classifier k nearest point considered sign majority used classify sample
The performance kNN algorithm influenced three main factor distance measure used locate nearest neighbour decision rule used derive classification neighbour number neighbour used classify new sample
It proved unlike method method universally asymptotically convergent
size training set increase observation regardless distribution sample drawn predicted class converge class assignment minimizes misclassification error
See Devroy et al
Conceptually rooted principle occurrence event modeled limited distribution
Occurrences event neither uniform random spatial environment factor infrastructure sociocultural topographic etc
constrain influence location event occur
Geospatial predictive modeling attempt describe constraint influence spatially correlating occurrence historical geospatial location environmental factor represent constraint influence
Geospatial predictive modeling process analyzing event geographic filter order make statement likelihood event occurrence emergence

I know I could simply divide confidence measure sample bucket would reduce reliability result would require trade reducing sample set range accepting larger error form broader test range
I want use information get accurate result possible
Measuring probability given single occurrence really make sense data fit sample
If many sample sample measuring
For example could take measure although symmetric
Once certain reliability measure algorithm update data every time additional sample manner
If detail regarding specific algorithm specific type prediction probably tailor something suit better scenario

I evaluating Credit Risk model predicts estimated likelihood customer defaulting mortgage account
The model Logistic Regression estimator built another team
They use Gini metric measure performance model
They achieved
Upon evaluation I found recall whilst error rate non rare event class default
Am I correct thinking Gini actually misleading metric case really show extremely poor predictive performance rare event class
I questioned tried recommend use metric well confusion matrix graph quickly dismissed
Any advice would much appreciated
The Gini Coefficient also expressed term area ROC curve AUC
The ROC curve hand influenced class imbalance false positive rate
If number negative lot larger could potential issue
In short Gini Coefficient similar pro con AUC ROC metric
Gini coefficient understanding bad mertric imbalanced classification related AUC work fine
Maybe gini impurity coefficient
Check AUC prediction
Also Area PR curve better metric imbalanced classification AUC maybe see

When testing choosing correct performance measure imperative making sure model work correctly
In literature common use measure always used past without really judging whether best way measure performance current problem
The common problematic measure RMSE regression accuracy classification
The RMSE penalizes larger error smaller error
However problem response variable right skewed error severely affected data point right end tail
Example right skewed distribution
A way handle might use measure predicted true value
Similarly bad measure class highly imbalanced
In binary classification problem class B class A trivial achieve accuracy
That mistake I seen newcomer machine learning
There different measure handle imbalanced class
There recently published book regarding performance metric classification called
I would highly recommend one starting machine learning predictive modelling
Evaluating learning algorithm A classification perspective In case I going much detail individual measure since covered future post
However I cover two simple trick

When regression plot histogram response
If extremely skewed go instead RMSE

When classification check balanced class
If highly imbalanced use
Values close indicate better performance
So next time using RMSE accuracy make sure right thing

I working predictive model I evaluate I find good
But I get good result using confusion matrix
What metric I Trust
I using metric
The problem highly unbalanced class
If data get high accuracy predict regardless feature data set
This show model accurate class highly unbalanced good actually differentiating two class
None statistic best tell different thing model fit
A metric like AUC Gini KS would better comparing model evaluating model fit highly unbalanced class
These statistic rank order prediction remove effect unbalanced class
Even unbalanced sample predict data get AUC
Keep mind also want use hold sample evaluation metric
For AUC detail check implementation Python

What fundamental difference predictive modeling clustering
according literature predictive modeling supervised learning aim construct model predict value target attribute
On hand clustering unsupervised method split data set couple group
In idea
finding target attribute actually trying categorize similar clustering
I know clustering make subgroup available data predictive modeling try find model predict value attribute unseen data based current available data
Could anyone explain difference two concept clearly
Thanks sometimes called learning teacher whereas left completely alone
split data training testing subsample used verifying computed model
Predictive regression model typically assign weight attribute
From compute internal evaluation metric necessarily correlate desired human judgment
Unsupervised learning clustering mostly treat attribute equal without external information one ca say attribute important

In also called fraction relevant instance among retrieved instance also known fraction relevant instance retrieved total amount relevant instance
Both precision recall therefore based understanding measure
Suppose computer program recognizing dog photograph identifies eight dog picture containing dog cat
Of eight dog identified five actually dog true positive rest cat false positive
The program precision recall
When return page relevant failing return additional relevant page precision recall
So case precision useful search result recall complete result
In item hypothesis accepted rejected based number selected compared sample size absence corresponds respectively maximum precision false positive maximum recall false negative
The pattern recognition example contained type I error type II error
Precision seen measure exactness whereas recall measure completeness
In simple term high precision mean algorithm returned substantially relevant result irrelevant one high recall mean algorithm returned relevant result
In information retrieval scenario instance document task return set relevant document given search term equivalently assign document one two category relevant relevant
In case relevant document simply belong relevant category
Recall defined retrieved search precision defined retrieved search search
In task precision class
number item correctly labeled belonging positive class
sum true positive item incorrectly labeled belonging class
Recall context defined
sum true positive item labeled belonging positive class
In information retrieval perfect precision score mean every result retrieved search relevant say nothing whether relevant document retrieved whereas perfect recall score mean relevant document retrieved search say nothing many irrelevant document also retrieved
In classification task precision score class C mean every item labeled belonging class C indeed belong class C say nothing number item class C labeled correctly whereas recall mean every item class C labeled belonging class C say nothing many item incorrectly also labeled belonging class C
Often inverse relationship precision recall possible increase one cost reducing
Brain surgery provides illustrative example tradeoff
Consider brain surgeon tasked removing cancerous tumor patient brain
The surgeon need remove tumor cell since remaining cancer cell regenerate tumor
Conversely surgeon must remove healthy brain cell since would leave patient impaired brain function
The surgeon may liberal area brain remove ensure extracted cancer cell
This decision increase recall reduces precision
On hand surgeon may conservative brain remove ensure extract cancer cell
This decision increase precision reduces recall
That say greater recall increase chance removing healthy cell negative outcome increase chance removing cancer cell positive outcome
Greater precision decrease chance removing healthy cell positive outcome also decrease chance removing cancer cell negative outcome
Usually precision recall score discussed isolation
Instead either value one measure compared fixed level measure
combined single measure
Examples measure combination precision recall weighted precision recall variant DeltaP DeltaP
weighted arithmetic mean Precision Inverse Precision weighted Bias well weighted arithmetic mean Recall Inverse Recall weighted Prevalence
Inverse Precision Inverse Recall simply Precision Recall inverse problem positive negative label exchanged real class prediction label
Recall Inverse Recall equivalently true positive rate false positive rate frequently plotted curve provide principled mechanism explore operating point tradeoff
Outside Information Retrieval application Recall Precision argued flawed ignore true negative cell contingency table easily manipulated biasing prediction
The first problem using second problem discounting chance component renormalizing longer affords opportunity explore tradeoff graphically
However renormalizations Recall Precision geometric mean thus act like debiased
In context precision recall defined term set
list document produced query set
list document internet relevant certain topic cf

The measure defined
In field precision fraction retrieved document query For example text search set document precision number correct result divided number returned result
Precision take retrieved document account also evaluated given rank considering topmost result returned system
This measure called
Precision used percent relevant document returned search
The two measure sometimes used together provide single measurement system
Note meaning usage precision field information retrieval differs definition within branch science technology
In information retrieval recall fraction relevant document successfully retrieved
For example text search set document recall number correct result divided number result returned
In binary classification recall called
It viewed probability relevant document retrieved query
It trivial achieve recall returning document response query
Therefore recall alone enough one need measure number document also example also computing precision
For classification task term see definition compare result classifier test trusted external judgment
The term refer classifier prediction sometimes known term refer whether prediction corresponds external judgment sometimes known
Let u define experiment positive instance negative instance condition
The four outcome formulated follows Precision recall defined Recall context also referred true positive rate precision also referred PPV related measure used classification include true negative rate
True negative rate also called
Additionally predicted positive condition rate PPCR identifies percentage total population flagged example search engine returning result retrieved document document PPCR
It possible interpret precision recall ratio probability Note random selection refers uniform distribution appropriate pool document
mean selecting document set retrieved document random fashion
The random selection document set equally likely selected
Note typical classification system probability retrieved document relevant depends document
The interpretation extends scenario also need explanation
Another interpretation precision recall follows
Precision average probability relevant retrieval
Recall average probability complete retrieval
Here average multiple retrieval query
A measure combine precision recall precision recall traditional balanced This measure approximately average two close generally case two number coincides square divided
There several reason criticized particular circumstance due bias evaluation metric
This also known measure recall precision evenly weighted
It special case general measure real value Two commonly used measure measure weight recall higher precision measure put emphasis precision recall
The derived van Rijsbergen measure effectiveness retrieval respect user attache time much importance recall precision
It based van Rijsbergen effectiveness measure second term weighted harmonic mean precision recall weight
Their relationship
There parameter strategy performance metric information retrieval system area curve AUC
For retrieval user objective clear precision recall ca optimized
As summarized Lopresti comfortable powerful paradigm

I application read barcode extract part check valid
I use C Autofac Nunit I undecided best implementation Facade Pattern
Strategy Pattern
Are overengineering bit
At least look example
I would drop Strategy pattern idea
Are going ever one strategy
I like first solution good testability DI I would call line code Facade really
I like solution A better opinion better job separating concern
The BarcodeReader read barcode return string barcode represents
Assuming nothing else app go Solution A
It keep thing succinct maintainable possible show need added complexity Solution B
A third option even use constructor static function performing check
Additionally I would rename function
They return value name reflect
You want go something like IsValid instead Check GetBarcode instead Read
I would opt Solution B
While necessarily look like strategy pattern I like better separation concern
The BarcodeReader generic know read part barcode send back
It used application reading barcodes
The Checker look business specific
Your first solution mixing business logic generic reading barcodes together
Note I assuming logic validating business logic barcode specific validation
If barcode specific validation go barcode reader
I would Model reader XmlReader
It check wellformed xml etc
Solution B make class easier test usually sign something right
You stub one fewer method
If consuming class interested barcode better approach

The Boy Scouts rule Always leave campground cleaner found
If find mess ground clean regardless might made mess
You intentionally improve environment next group camper
Actually original form rule written Robert Stephenson Smyth father scouting Try leave world little better found
What followed similar rule code Always check module cleaner checked
No matter original author always made effort matter small improve module
What would result
I think followed simple rule see end relentless deterioration software system
Instead system would gradually get better better evolved
We also see caring system whole rather individual caring small little part
I think rule much ask
You make every module perfect check
You simply make checked
Of course mean code module must clean
It also mean clean least one thing check module back
You might simply improve name one variable split one long function two smaller function
You might break circular dependency add interface decouple policy detail
Frankly sound like common decency like washing hand use restroom putting trash bin instead dropping floor
Indeed act leaving mess code socially unacceptable
It something
But
Caring code one thing
Caring code quite another
Teams help clean
They follow Boy Scout rule good everyone good

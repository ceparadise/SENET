typically support set construct behave generally like function differ syntactically semantically usual function
Common simple example include arithmetic addition comparison logical operation
More involved example include assignment usually access record object usually often
Languages usually define set operator case allow operator
operator usually contrast
In language function may seen special form prefix operator fixed level associativity often compulsory

Most language support function really claim support operator unless prefix notation single precedence level
Semantically operator seen special form function different calling notation limited number parameter usually
The position operator respect operand may syntax involving operator depends number precedence applicable
Most programming language support supporting operand operator C ternary
There prefix unary operator unary minus postfix unary operator binary operation infix
Infix operation higher arity require additional symbol
C written indeed common example often referred ternary operator
Prefix postfix operation support desired arity however
Occasionally part language may described matchfix circumfix operator either simplify language description implementation
A circumfix operator consists two part enclose operand
Circumfix operator highest precedence content evaluated resulting value used surrounding expression
The familiar circumfix operator parenthesis mentioned used indicate part expression evaluated others
Another example physic notation Dirac
Circumfix operator especially useful denote operation involve many varying number operand
The specification language specify syntax operator support language support operator require syntax defined programmer
The semantics operator particularly depends value evaluation strategy argument passing mode boolean
Simply involving operator evaluated way resulting may value may object allowing assignment
In simple case identical usual function call example addition generally equivalent function call comparison meaning argument evaluated usual way function evaluated result returned value
However semantics significantly different
For example assignment target evaluated instead address used store value corresponding semantics
Further assignment may statement value may expression value value either value able assigned
As another example element access operator
operate value essentially semantics value name
Use operator operand particularly notable unary
In C instance following statement legal depends fact array indexing return An important use binary operator modifies left argument produce side effect evaluates argument
This allows sequence operator affecting original argument allowing similar
A common example operator library allows fluent output follows A language may contain fixed number operator
etc
may allow creation operator

Some programming language restrict operator symbol special character like others allow also name like

Most language set operator allow operator significantly complicates parsing
Many language allow operator used type others allow existing operator used type known
Some language allow new operator defined however either compile time run time
This may involve specifying operator separate language within language
Definition new operator particularly runtime definition often make correct program impossible since syntax language may even constructing syntax tree may require solving halting problem impossible
This occurs example dialect
Common example differ syntactically mathematical arithmetic operation
greater name often outside language set identifier function called syntax different language syntax calling function
As function greater would generally named identifier called function
Instead operation us special character tokenized separately infix notation
Common example differ semantically argument passing mode boolean operation frequently feature
conjunction X AND Y evaluates later argument earlier one false language strict function
This behaves instead similarly
Less common operator include A compiler implement operator function
Some operator supported language direct mapping small number commonly found though others used express may complicated implementation
In programming language operator may definition one kind data operator used addition number concatenation string
Such operator said
In language support operator overloading programmer limited set operator operator overloading often used define customized us operator
In example operator greater AND le
Some language also allow operand operator implicitly converted suitable data type operation occur
For example coercion rule lead producing result
The text converted number addition take place
Further integer either floating number number decimal place integer converted floating point number respectively
follows opposite expression convert integer string concatenate two operand form
In presence coercion language programmer must aware specific rule regarding operand type operation result type avoid subtle programming mistake
The following table show operator feature several programming language All operator Alphanumeric equivalent

Some non equivalent


So yet seen introduction computer programming
The answer computed anything
We gotten turtle drawing acting animation
Techniques reducing complexity program want heart lesson
Now time cover procedure compute
In lesson learn new kind procedure called
Operators produce
You work operator Logo math stuff
Most operator take input something input produce operator add input result procedure output
Operators combined form
Since jLogo provides operator notation constructing expression bit confusing first
let visualize expression learn draw
So far procedure working
What command produce
The command using thing see invoke turtle draw line turtle rotates color turtle pen changed etc
There another kind procedure called
An procedure produce
The output used somewhere need
To help learn understand operator expression I going use call book
Plumbing diagram consist box representing procedure
If procedure defined opening top box one input
If procedure produce output opening bottom box
Figure show box command input operator one input output
Figure show plumbing diagram box command operator yet seen
display input TG CommandCenter move cursor first column next line
expects input positive integer produce output integer greater equal zero le input
As example invoking input cause output one integer
You see combining take input
Here example using one includes using
abbreviated form
Use following TG applet try stuff
Try leaving command You get error message Operators one input produce one output
As example operator take two input output value sum two input
Figure show plumbing diagram box generic operator two input operator
There operator input simply produce output
These operator simply provide information
Two operator used get current size TG graphic canvas
As name suggests operator output number turtle step would currently take get bottom canvas top
Its complement output wide canvas currently
Table contains common math operator well couple procedure use lesson
Try play around bit
use TG menu system open graphic canvas applet work
One thing may appear strange first way name operation come first followed input
But think jLogo consistant procedure entered way
First something want done come thing thing use input
With little experience practice get used way thing
Here procedure computes area rectangle print
In computer science operator precedes input operand called
Most programming language support called
As see operator placed operand
Logo interpreter support prefix infix notation math relational operator
But lesson work prefix operator
Expressions composition operation produce output
In expression output one operation fed another operation input
Until get practice putting together expression bit confusing
But get frustrated save day
Plumbing diagram help understand structure expression
The organization show graphically make jLogo expression much easier write
Take example computing circumference area circle given radius
Here corresponding plumbing diagram
Notice one new thing I introduced code
I added make code easier read
jLogo check ensure matching parenthesis surround complete expression
So use see fit
Following common math application work high school math class
In previous lesson wrote procedure named drew rectangle
Our implementation turtle pen size traveling coloring every rectangle
If invoked fillRect width input height input turtle would walk forward backward step column pixel rectangle
The turtle would travel turtle step order paint rectangle moving one column next column
Luckily u digital turtle tireless mind
But math operation make turtle job easier
In iteration lesson drew circle box
All use thick pen draw line equal length pen width
We able sort thing draw box
By computing middle point height desired rectangle move turtle Y coordinate along left X coordinate
Then setting pen size height heading turtle east lowering pen get draw moving forward width rectangle
In example rectangle turtle move step order paint
Now big improvement
Here source code new fillRect
Read type watch performed turtle
Time project
We going create digital collage
Figure show couple example
Click either image see larger copy
The first image consists hundred colored box
The box size location color chosen randomly
The second image similar size box vary twenty turtle step side one hundred turtle step side twenty step increment
The size chosen randomly
Relying start writing new program And help I written everything know problem
This good bit information problem solving
It enough u get going let move next step writing computer program
The plan best expressed
Our program produce artwork shown left Figure box pretty simple
And given write two procedure What three level abstraction hierarchy look like Figure
The next step process writing RandomBoxes
This mean entering Logo procedure
To get started enter version wrote test
Next define new procedure
It always nice get something working I type partially functional version
It draw black box corner
What nice verify program least partially work
It always easier find problem incrementally develop program
In code part I still need figure documented
Once I I know working I fix source code one change time code accomplishes comment say
Try version procedure
You able invoke CommandCenter end solid box displayed
To wrap first pas program add initializes graphic canvas edly invokes
Once get initial version program working fix stuff documented comment line one thing time
But take time get I shown working
Do read done Time add randomness program
The first comment need converted Logo code one set pen color random number
What first step
How drawing plumbing diagram
I
In diagram input operator produce output number range inclusive
The output supplied input command
Now turn convert plumbing diagram source code replace literal input code
Test invoking time
If change working seeing box different color time invoke
Remember possible get color two time row number output operator truely random
Once working Now let move random X input procedure
Again start plumbing diagram shown Figure output number turtle step left edge graphic canvas right edge
But half X coordinate negative almost half positive zero X coordinate must accounted
So need map
So shown plumbing diagram input subtract half output
Let walk example presented Table
In first four row output
When input output range
The middle column provides output given input column one
The third column X coordinate would become input procedure
The first two row Table contain real output middle two case
The edge case minimum maximum value output input
The last two row left exercise verify understand going
Ok turn
Convert Figure Logo source code replace first zero invocation
Test code invoking CommandCenter time
Each time box appear random X location random color
But box lower edge Y coordinate
You still need draw plumbing diagram code computing random Y coordinate
But best change one part program time
Complete program
Computing random Y coordinate similar done X coordinate
One problem might run fitting invocation single line especially working
The source code expression random X computation take character including space parenthesis improve readability
Assuming expression compute random Y coordinate similar enough room line applet include expression
Since instruction jLogo must fit line Editor treat tilde character specially
If tilde last character line Editor content interpreted tilde ignored current line joined following line
In programmer language tilde acting
In previous lesson wrote procedure long line instruction
Here could entered Editor two line
You probably break invocation multiple line
Note I indented second line reflect continuation
A command two input
So I done indent continued line second input line beginning first input
Although necessary something I always make code easier read
Ok I give complete solution program
If following along thinking hard program going
Your box go top right side graphic canvas
Compare program draw
If partial box fix On much interesting challenge get turtle draw house varied height width
Notice house Figure similar bit different
Look close notice taller house taller door window
The wider house wider door window
All part vary proportion
Start lesson Hierarchical Structure
It drew street identical house shown Figure
You modify
Give four input new program drawHouse
To get figure I replaced drawStreet procedure basically But finished program procedure looked like
I started simpler goal
Experienced programmer plan get end result making series small change
For example first step add input
The body When worked drew street looked like figure
Once I working I added input procedure
I modified body supplying four input shown
When worked drew street looked like figure
Getting close door window still need fixed
It time modify give input like
So step step procedure drawing house modified program draw
You learned procedure produce value
This output value fed another procedure input
Youve exposed many operator built Logo mostly mathematical operator basic arithmetic
You learned construct help visualize connect command literal operator form expression need program
Finally used command display literal value output operator expression
Putting command program allows see

In set stored storage location denoted word copy value variable
In assignment statement expression fundamental construct
Today commonly used notation basic operation come originally Superplan popularized followed originally popularised although many notation use
In language symbol used regarded meaning assignment value others define assignment statement meaning used expression
Assignments typically allow variable hold different value different time
However language primarily allow kind destructive reassignment might imply change state
The purpose enforce
function depend state variable produce result given set parametric input point time
Modern program language also often use similar strategy although le strict certain part order reduce complexity normally conjunction complementing methodology
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed purely functional language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent reassignment allowed
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available purely functional language variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include data structure var accepts multiple assignment value equal contrast Haskell dataflow variable cell data structure like list symbol vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate represented
This type one possible value therefore containing information
It typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
Certain use pattern common thus often special syntax support
These primarily reduce redundancy source code also simplify compilation clarifying programmer intent easing analysis source code
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant provide special operator called like instead written
Beyond syntactic sugar simplifies compilation since make clear modification variable possible
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
Chained assignment equivalent sequence assignment evaluation strategy differs language
For simple chained assignment like initializing multiple variable evaluation strategy matter target assignment connected way evaluation strategy affect result
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment expression value
In case chain assignment implemented assignment happen
For example equivalent
In also available value class type declaring appropriate return type assignment operator
In assignment statement expression thus value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
This essentially equivalent though actual variable produced temporary value
Some programming language since allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
This often known introduced name sometimes called though confusing used single assignment opposite
If side assignment single variable
array structure feature called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly swap value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Some language Go Python combine parallel assignment tuples automatic allow multiple return value single function Python example This provides alternative use returning multiple value function
This date CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally
In C similar parallel assignment allowing multiple assignment occur within single statement writing instead
This primarily used replaced parallel assignment language Go
However code ensure perfect simultaneity since right side following code evaluated left side
In language Python assign two variable concurrently using initial value compute new b
The use equal sign assignment operator frequently criticized due conflict equal comparison equality
This result confusion novice writing code confusion even experienced programmer reading code
The use equal assignment date back language designed particularly popularized Fortran A notorious example bad idea choice equal sign denote assignment
It go back Fortran blindly copied army language designer
Why bad idea
Because overthrow century old tradition let denote comparison equality predicate either true false
But Fortran made mean assignment enforcing equality
In case operand unequal footing The left operand variable made equal right operand expression
x mean thing x
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C including one famous attempt backdoor Linux kernel assignment operator also return value assigned way function return value validly nested inside expression
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
The two common representation copying assignment
Both form may semantically denote either assignment assignment also value depending language usage
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Mathematical assignment generally depicted
Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix postfix syntax statement including assignment

First answer state good programming math
This true
I think anyone ever said either bad worthless skill many people area little programming math I qualify
Like academic field CS purist researcher necessarily interdisciplinary field people without programming skill advanced math skill find place contribute
In addition program like information science even remotely information system often offer graduate education research opportunity require programming math
Two critical area interaction HCI artificial intelligence AI heavily heavily dependent psychology focus mostly experimental computational cognitive psychology social psych playing growing role
Many people studied psychology anywhere decent amazing skill applied stat especially experimental psych
In addition HCI welcoming area people art design
One absolute favorite people field full professor Human Computer Interaction Institute School Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University CS program considered many top CS research institution world
She BFA MDes degree CS started although eventually completed PhD CS CMU
person go art CS
Second degree CS probably done little programming degree STEM probably little math may fear thing naturally bad
However solid predictor
going claim anyone find interesting master programming I say seen student succeed grit determination anything else seen student natural gift programming fail willing apply
The notion need great math skill nonsense cover much math beyond algebra first year use math example prof force solve trig problem intro like trig required
Most BA CS program require two semester math Calc I Discrete Math
I take math beyond semester calc I poorly remembered nothing I take introductory computer programming course senior year I needed gen ed
I adapted quickly I like I decent facility language sharpened several year demanding writing assignment good sometimes harsh always nice critique faculty chosen major history English
I eventually learned great deal math lot application math CS unlike math considered pejorative many
However I recently accepted I really describe good anymore
Like literally people I felt math skill far
There basically two kind CS first studying computer computation work make work better second make computer interesting thing
latter camp frankly u research area get funding u consider notion ideologically impure pretty laughable
If want study CS I recommend taking CS course usually programming always data structure algorithm depending school typically three four semester taken sequence
Also take math calc I discrete intro course
However I follow recommendation straightforward way
If find able reasonably well CS course enjoy continue study get job
You usually get programming job maybe greatest programming job even le although I would recommend web database development go MS program least theoretically
Work great get paid learn get valuable experience
If find succeed programming hate really give try
easy still want CS two practical path cognitive psych art
I know guy data science entirely know undergrad area sure hole nothing critical importance hole knowledge
He PhD classic Latin Greek
one way CS
I found computer allowed earn pretty good income creative allowed explore concept mind thought limitless

I know Big O notation used ass efficient algorithm I understand read Big O notation exactly efficient algorithm
Can somebody perhaps explain basic Big O notation
Thanks
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
good explanation notation use
page look explain pretty clearly
Essentially convenient way quickly accurately assessing performance characteristic algorithm
Be quickly worst case average case algorithm run
How much space worst average case us
Sometimes useful algorithm performs number item known amortized analysis
The fundamental characteristic notation leaf term become irrelevant get large
For example get large becomes irrelevant
This would
describes limiting behavior function
For computer science typically use show algorithm scale well get larger set data
For example lookup collection typically vary described using notation based type collection
A Framework property documented follows Getting setting value property approach O operation That basically say matter many item add collection getting item done constant time
A hand describes follows This method performs linear search therefore method O n operation n Count
This basically say algorithm get slower linear time add item
If put item take approximately long average list containing item etc

Critiques big data paradigm come two flavor question implication approach question way currently done
One approach criticism field
A crucial problem know much underlying empirical lead emergence se typical network characteristic Big Data
In critique Snijders Matzat point often strong assumption made mathematical property may reflect really going level
Mark Graham leveled broad critique assertion big data spell end theory focusing particular notion big data must always contextualized social economic political context
Even company invest sum derive insight information streaming supplier customer le employee sufficiently mature process skill
To overcome insight deficit big data matter comprehensive well analysed must complemented big judgment according article Harvard Business Review
Much line pointed decision based analysis big data inevitably informed world past best currently
Fed large number data past experience algorithm predict future development future similar past
If system dynamic future change past say little future
In order make prediction changing environment would necessary thorough understanding system dynamic requires theory
As response critique suggested combine big data approach computer simulation
model increasingly getting better predicting outcome social complexity even unknown future scenario computer simulation based collection mutually interdependent algorithm
In addition use multivariate method probe latent structure data proven useful analytic approach go well beyond approach typically employed smaller data set
In health biology conventional scientific approach based experimentation
For approach limiting factor relevant data confirm refute initial hypothesis
A new postulate accepted bioscience information provided data huge volume without prior hypothesis complementary sometimes necessary conventional approach based experimentation
In massive approach formulation relevant hypothesis explain data limiting factor
The search logic reversed limit induction Glory Science Philosophy scandal considered
advocate concerned threat privacy represented increasing storage integration expert panel released various policy recommendation conform practice expectation privacy
Nayef argues new kind social contract needed protect individual liberty context Big Data giant corporation vast amount information
The use Big Data monitored better regulated national international level
Barocas Nissenbaum argue one way protecting individual user informed type information collected shared constrains purpose
The model Big Data concerting centre around computational scalability lack loss around perceptibility understandability information
This led framework characterises Big Data application according wrote big data become fad scientific research
Researcher raised concern use big data science neglecting principle choosing concerned actually handling huge amount data
This approach may lead result one way another
Integration across heterogeneous data might considered big data others formidable logistical well analytical challenge many researcher argue integration likely represent promising new frontier science
In provocative article Critical Questions Big Data author title big data part large data set offer higher form intelligence knowledge aura truth objectivity accuracy
Users big data often lost sheer volume number working Big Data still subjective quantifies necessarily closer claim objective truth
Recent development BI domain reporting especially target improvement usability big data automated data correlation
Big data analysis often shallow compared analysis smaller data set
In many big data project large data analysis happening challenge part data preprocessing
Big data vague term time obsession entrepreneur consultant scientist medium
Big data showcase failed deliver good prediction recent year overstating flu outbreak factor two
Similarly election prediction solely based Twitter often target
Big data often pose challenge small data adding data solve problem bias may emphasize problem
In particular data source Twitter representative overall population result drawn source may lead wrong conclusion
based big data statistical analysis good job translating web page
However result specialized domain may dramatically skewed
On hand big data may also introduce new problem simultaneously testing large set hypothesis likely produce many false result mistakenly appear significant
Ioannidis argued published research finding false due essentially effect many scientific team researcher perform many experiment
process big amount scientific data although big data technology likelihood significant result actually false grows fast even positive result published
Furthermore big data analytics result good model predicated
In example big data took part attempting predict result Presidential Election varying degree success

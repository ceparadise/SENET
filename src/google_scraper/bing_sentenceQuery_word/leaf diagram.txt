In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

The big advantage list sentence ability represent data mean sublists
In chapter look example use list sublists represent information structure
The kind structure consider called resemble tree nature The component tree called At top tree interior diagram bottom branch extend
We going begin considering tree abstract data type without thinking list used represent tree
For example construct tree using procedure named Scheme primitive
About halfway chapter explore relationship tree list
Here tree represents world Each node tree represents region world
Consider node labeled Great Britain
There two part node The obvious part label name Great Britain
But region world included within Great node attached beneath Great Britain also part node
We say every node zero For moment let say datum either word sentence
The child tree
Notice definition tree made tree
What base case
This family metaphor also part terminology tree
We say node another node two node In advanced treatment even hear thing like grandparent cousin wo get
What happens prune actual tree cutting branch
The part essentially tree smaller trunk fewer branch
The metaphor perfect part root still stick end ground hope end take root new tree
It country example country branch node entire world tree also tree
Depending think Great Britain either component entire world collection smaller location
So branch node represents Great Britain root node entire tree
What node
It might seem natural think node information one circle think node including datum
In way thinking node would separate every node word sentence separate element
However useful think node structure includes everything circle also datum child
So think node Great Britain thinking name Great Britain also everything Great Britain
From perspective root node tree includes entire tree
We might well say node tree
The constructor tree actually constructor one node root node
Our constructor tree therefore called
It take two argument datum possibly empty list child
As following example show constructing think one tree requires construction many node
You notice defined place shown figure
That got tired typing going invent abbreviation later
For take time show selector tree
tree node return datum node
node return list child node
A list tree called Here abbreviation help u construct world tree le typing
Unlike intended work tree general abbreviation designed world tree specifically mind With abbreviation world tree somewhat easier define Now tree many city world
At first glance may seem like simple case recursion calling
But since look like single recursive call really call equivalent recursive call one child given tree node
Note call call
This pattern called Mutual recursion often useful technique dealing tree
In typical recursion seen chapter moved sequentially list sentence recursive call taking u one step right
In following paragraph present three different model help think shape tree give rise mutual recursion
In first model going think initialization procedure helper procedure
Suppose want count leaf tree
Unless argument shallow tree involve counting leaf child tree
What want straightforward sequential recursion list child
But given wrong argument tree list child
So need initialization procedure whose job extract list child invoke helper procedure list argument
The helper procedure follows usual sequential list pattern Do something list recursively handle list
Now
In usual sequential recursion list something simple word
What special tree tree like entire data structure started
Therefore must invoke procedure whose domain tree
This model built two idea
One idea domain function reason need two procedure need one take tree argument one take list tree argument
The idea leap faith assume invocation within correctly handle child without tracing exact sequence event
The second model easier state le rigorous
Because nature tree order visit every node able move two different direction
From given node able move child child must able move next sibling
The job move left right list child
It using familiar kind recursion invokes directly
The downward motion happens move one level invoking
How program move one level
At level invoked recursively
The third model also based nature tree
Imagine moment node tree one child
In case could move root single leaf structure similar actual procedure carrying sequential recursion The trouble course downward step single next node
Instead single path root leaf multiple path root many leaf
To make idea downward motion sequential recursion work real tree level must clone many time child
factory manufacture clone
It hire one little person child accumulates result
The key point recursion tree child tree perfectly good tree
This recursiveness nature tree give rise recursive structure program use tree
The reason say recursive invocation cause one several recursive invocation one child way
In fact use name situation procedure invocation result one recursive call even argument tree
The computation Fibonacci number Chapter example tree recursion tree
The recursion Chapter also tree recursion structured somewhat character even though use formal mechanism exploring chapter
The recursion horizontal one moving one element another within list recursion vertical one exploring sublist given list
Procedures explore tree always simple
We started example could write using function understand structure problem take complexity mutual recursion
But many tree problem quite fit function
For example let write predicate take name place tree argument tell whether place tree
It possible make work This awkward construction however also performs unnecessary computation
If place looking happens first child node nevertheless look child well
We better replacing use mutual recursion Although mutual recursion little tricky read structure program fit way describe algorithm English
A place tree one two condition hold place datum root tree place recursively one child tree tree
That say
As say place one group tree place first tree one remaining tree
Our next project similar previous one little intricate
We like able locate city find larger region enclose city
For example want say Instead getting answer whether city tree want find
The algorithm recursive To look Berkeley within world need able look Berkeley within subtree
The node several child country
recursively asks child find path Berkeley
All one child return ca find Berkeley within territory
But node return To make complete path prepend name current node path
What happens try look Berkeley Australia
Since Australia child return path Berkeley Australia return
Compare structure
The helper procedure almost identical
The main procedure look different harder job check two possibility The city might datum argument node might belong one child tree
We done lot tree yet talked way Scheme store tree internally
How work
It turn convenient represent tree term list
In word tree list whose first element datum whose remaining element subtrees
Ordinarily however going print tree entirety
As example extract subset information put readable form
The procedure define abstract data type tree
Using ADT able write several useful procedure manipulate tree pinning exactly tree represented Scheme list
Although would possible refer part node using directly program readable use selector constructor
Consider example What mean context
Is tree datum
A child
A forest
Of course could work careful reasoning form presented example originally much clearer Even better would Using appropriate selector constructor called data abstraction
Failing use appropriate selector constructor called Since wrote selector constructor tree could defined use different representation You might expect change representation would require change procedure wrote earlier
But fact procedure would continue work perfectly see representation
They respect data abstraction
As long find right information matter tree stored
All matter constructor selector compatible
On hand example section violated data abstraction using find second child would fail changed representation
Many case like one formerly working program failed change representation led programmer use moralistic term respecting violating data abstraction
Consider notation arithmetic expression
Scheme us notation
By contrast people Scheme programmer generally represent arithmetic computation using notation function symbol go two argument
Our goal section translate infix arithmetic expression tree representing computation
This translation process called expression
For example turn expression tree The point using tree going easy perform computation tree form
In original infix form hard know first rule determine implicit grouping Multiplication division come addition subtraction operation precedence done left right
Our sample expression equivalent In tree representation easy see operation nearer leaf done first root node last operation depends result operation
Our program take argument infix arithmetic expression form list Each element list must one three thing number one four symbol sublist list example satisfying rule
You imagine implementing pocket calculator
If implementing computer programming language also accept variable name operand
But bothering complication really affect part problem turning expression tree
What make problem tricky ca put list element tree soon see
For example first three element sample list
It tempting build subtree three element But compare picture earlier picture correct tree see second argument invocation number rather subexpression
By reasoning might think examine entire expression start building tree
But fact sometimes build subtree confidence
For example see minus sign sample expression tell subexpression come complete higher precedence
Here plan
The program examine argument left right
Since program ca finish processing list element right away maintain information element examined entirely processed
It going easier maintain information two part one list operation another operand
Here first step parsing sample expression program examines element argument putting number onto operand list operation symbol onto operation list At point program looking operator infix expression
If newly seen operator lower precedence already head list operation would time carry operation creating tree root first two operand list child
Instead since higher precedence program ready create subtree must instead add operation list
This time newly seen operation lower precedence head operation list
Therefore time program operator making subtree containing operator first two element operand list
This new subtree becomes new first element operand list
Because program decided handle waiting operator still moved operator infix expression operator list
Now program must compare head list
These two operator precedence
Since want carry operator left right time handle operator
Finally program move operator onto operator list
The next several step similar one already seen
This new situation The first unseen element infix expression neither number operator sublist
We recursively subexpression adding resulting tree operand list
Then proceed processing higher precedence priority
Once program examined every element infix expression operator remaining operator list must handled
In case one operator
Once operator handled one element remaining operand list element desired tree entire original expression
The following program implement algorithm
It work correctly formed infix expression given argument like give incorrect result Scheme error
We promised building tree would easy compute value expression
Here program A leaf node perfectly good actual argument tree procedure even though picture leaf node look treeish branch
A common mistake make base case recursion node whose child leaf instead node leaf
The value returned tree forest
therefore suitable actual argument procedure expects tree
What mean printout
Why two set parenthesis
Suppose change definition tree constructor us instead How change selector everything still work
Write procedure take tree argument return largest number node connected link
That leaf node depth tree child root node leaf depth
Our world tree depth longest path root leaf example world country state city
Write procedure take tree argument return total number node tree
Earlier counted number node
Write procedure take tree argument return copy tree leaf node original tree removed
If argument tree root node child return result removing root node would tree
Write program par Scheme arithmetic expression kind tree produce infix expression
Assume procedure invocation Scheme expression two argument
The resulting tree valid argument You solve problem without restriction invocation rewrite assume every branch node two child
You probably think tree short tall
But since tree convention call shallow deep
Another example data abstraction violation Chapter
When creates empty database use constructor
Instead merely used quoted empty sentence Actually see shortly element operand list tree put operand list tree whose datum number

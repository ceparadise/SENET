Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included As project manager must familiar term Risk
Risk nothing assumption made project manager stakeholder including core team member pricing scope schedule many
It traditional thinking risk negative working modern era avoid thinking like
Risk negative threat well positive opportunity
A project manager risk averse nature
accept risk associated project
Now big question extract information pertaining risk associated project
The first thing project manager check whether project charter analyzed
As know high level information regarding project requirement contained project charter
So get information risk associated project
Thoroughly go project charter make complete study understand basic behind
Further try elaborate information taken project charter pertaining risk
They plan risk way stakeholder share information regarding risk associated project
Disaster strike time project sole responsibility create response plan
First need allocate task related stakeholder well versed identifying risk
For identifying potential risk perform brainstorming Delphi even face face discussion process expert
Based input note identified risk plan
Divide identified risk two category threat opportunity
Remember weakness project treated threat something strong project treated opportunity project
A project manager attentively focus reducing threat earliest grabbing opportunity soon possible
And project governance come picture
It depends good balancing threat opportunity project
Now project manager analyze risk greater impact prioritize accordingly
Later new list risk reflecting magnitude impact created
A project manager create template figuring probability impact risk project
Based table showing probability impact identified risk project prepared
All put template meant probability impact figure representation
This known probability impact matrix
This matrix show influencing risk project project manager maintain ratio threat opportunity effectively way incremental cost reducing threat
The incremental cost reducing threat adjusted extra cost getting opportunity
This effective way working
If think particular scope easily achievable could finished bit earlier grab opportunity deploying experienced team member
Similarly plan reduce threat case scope work
After identifying risk need qualitatively quantitatively locate risk based probability well impact project
The list shown hierarchical way keeping topmost threat opportunity top table
Ideally put threat opportunity two separate column along name risk also column describing nature risk identifier risk impact risk frequency risk identified
Overall table known breakdown structure popularly known risk breakdown structure
risk decomposed risk risk response planning every risk identified qualitatively quantitatively
Risk breakdown structure important tool project manager run project successfully
The interesting thing identify risk planning stage planning task risk identification also task project manager
It iterative progressively elaborated nature
As work progress number risk increase better clarity scope work
So project manager task identify risk project initiation project closing stage
Risk could anywhere anytime

risk breakdown structure RBS form much like work breakdown structure WBS
Both organized hierarchical breakdown contain descending level increased detail
Both WBS RBS seek decompose item actionable level
With risk breakdown structure risk organized according risk category
The highest level RBS would include project name
In construction project example next highest level risk might include project management material supply weather
When decompose risk category project management might list inexperienced project manager relatively young project management office
Beneath young project management office might find risk like lacking established procedure little documented lesson learned
The risk breakdown structure constructed several format
Sometimes appear form flow chart sometimes form outline list

The risk breakdown structure created project manager enormous input member project management team
Like many project management document may need revised several time life project
Inputs creating risk breakdown structure include project management plan organizational process asset enterprise environmental factor
A risk breakdown structure provides way group potential cause risk
In example construction project multiple risk identified category project management
The RBS useful Identify Risks process help project team examine source risk arise

The main us benefit RBS outlined Risk Breakdown Structure used list includes project risksÂ risk identification phase irrespective risk identification methodÂ used
Â For example brainstorming various element RBS enablesÂ participant identify risk RBS area
The RBSÂ structure risk identification interview also schedule forÂ discussion facilitator The identified risk mapped lowest level RBS whichÂ break possible gap expose duplication
This ensures theÂ risk identification method covered possible risk
The RBS ensuresÂ possible source risk project explored
Â Â The identified risk allocated various element RBS enablesÂ identify Â crucial source risk project
ThisÂ identification risk also done counting risk RBSÂ area
However mere counting risk also mislead count ofÂ relative severity risk may sometimes go wrong
Thus area RBSÂ may minor risk area may major risk
A riskÂ score created based size scale individual risk within theÂ RBS
This risk score compared risk within area toÂ evaluate concentration risk within RBS
This turn help inÂ indicating RBS area give risk The simple list risk list risk prepared based prioritiesÂ help assessment risk exposure project
The insight ofÂ risk obtained categorising risk according RiskÂ Breakdown Structure
Â Risk Breakdown Structure RBS provides common framework compareÂ exposure risk different project competing tender
TheÂ risk identified project also structured RBS
In case ofÂ tender competing tender help identify risk structured RBS
The amount type risk associated tender areÂ represented consistent format
This allows select preferredÂ tender considering relative risk exposure
The risk exposure theÂ individual project also compared using common RBS framework inÂ order prioritise based relative risk The RBS provides risk information individual project theÂ senior management also provides access required report theÂ project team action
The report generally include total number risk orÂ total risk scored RBS area
The report basicallyÂ represented metric graphical form
By selecting appropriate RBSÂ area project team member notified risk present within theirÂ The RBS also provides Â information seniorÂ management removing possible misunderstanding confusionÂ project
The risk within RBS area directlyÂ compared across project advanced using RBS basedÂ numbering The Risk Breakdown Structure also common platform analysingÂ information project project Analysis based structure help reveal risk occur The generic risk along effective response also recorded forÂ future reference
Accordingly preventive response also developed Â implemented referred future Â

A also referred Contract Work Breakdown Structure CWBS breakdown project smaller component
A work breakdown structure key project deliverable organizes team manageable section
The PMBOK defines work breakdown structure A hierarchical decomposition total work carried accomplish project objective create required deliverable
A structure element may combination thereof
A WBS also provides necessary framework detailed cost estimating control along providing guidance development control
WBS hierarchical incremental decomposition project phase deliverable work package
It show subdivision effort required achieve objective example
In project contract WBS developed starting end objective successively subdividing manageable component term size duration responsibility system subsystem component subtasks work package include step necessary achieve objective
The work breakdown structure provides common framework natural development overall planning control contract basis dividing work definable increment developed technical schedule cost labor hour reporting established
A work breakdown structure permit summing subordinate cost task material successively higher level parent task material etc
For element work breakdown structure description task performed generated
This technique sometimes called used define organize total
The WBS organized around primary product project planned outcome instead work needed produce product planned action
Since planned outcome desired end project form relatively stable set category cost planned action needed achieve collected
A WBS make easy assign project activity one one terminal element WBS
In addition function cost accounting WBS also help map requirement one level system specification another example requirement cross reference matrix mapping functional requirement high level low level design document
The WBS may displayed horizontally form vertically tree structure like organization chart
The development WBS normally occurs start project precedes detailed project task planning
The concept work breakdown structure developed PERT DoD
PERT introduced Navy support development missile program
While term work breakdown structure used first implementation PERT organize task category
By June DoD aerospace industry published document system described WBS approach
This guide endorsed Secretary Defense adoption service
In DoD issued Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items requiring use work breakdown structure across DoD
The document revised several time recently
The current version document found Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items
It includes WBS definition specific defense materiel commodity system address WBS element common system
Defense Materiel Item category The common element identified Appendix L Integration assembly test checkout Systems engineering Program management System test evaluation Training Data Peculiar support equipment Common support equipment activation Industrial facility Initial spare repair part
The standard also includes additional common element unique Space Systems Launch Vehicle Systems Automated Information Systems
In PMI documented expansion technique across organization
The PMBOK Guide provides overview WBS concept Practice Standard Work Breakdown Structures comparable DoD standard intended general application
An important design principle work breakdown structure called rule
It defined follows In addition rule important overlap scope definition different element work breakdown structure
This ambiguity could result duplicated work miscommunications responsibility authority
Such overlap could also cause confusion regarding project cost accounting
If WBS element name ambiguous WBS dictionary help clarify distinction WBS element
The WBS Dictionary describes component WBS deliverable activity scope sometimes date cost quality
If work breakdown structure designer attempt capture detail WBS designer likely include either many action action
Too many action exceed parent scope fall short parent scope
The best way adhere rule define WBS element term outcome result action
This also ensures WBS overly prescriptive method allowing greater ingenuity creative thinking part project participant
For new product development project common technique ensure WBS use
may use similar technique employ feature breakdown structure
When project provides professional service common technique capture planned deliverable create WBS
Work breakdown structure subdivide work project phase
preliminary design phase critical design phase must ensure phase clearly separated deliverable also used defining entry
approved preliminary critical
One must decide stop dividing work smaller element
This assist determining duration activity necessary produce deliverable defined WBS
There several heuristic rule thumb used determining appropriate duration activity group activity necessary produce specific deliverable defined WBS
A work package activity level task It common work breakdown structure element numbered sequentially reveal hierarchical structure
The purpose numbering provide consistent approach identifying managing WBS across like system regardless vendor service
For example example identifies item Level WBS element since three number separated
A coding scheme also help WBS element recognized written context allows mapping WBS Dictionary
A practical example WBS coding scheme The lowest element terminal element one subdivided
In Work Breakdown Structure element activity also known work package item term linked scheduled
At juncture WBS element organization unit control account work package established performance planned measured recorded controlled
A WBS expressed level interest
Three level minimum recommended additional level item high cost high risk two level detail case system engineering program management standard showing example WBS varying depth software development point going level system level
The higher WBS structure consistent whatever norm template mandate exist within organization domain
For example shipbuilding Navy must respect nautical term hierarchy structure put embedded Naval Architecture matching Navy office procedure built match naval architecture structure significant change WBS element numbering naming hierarchy would unacceptable
The figure left show work breakdown structure construction technique demonstrates rule progressive elaboration technique
At WBS Level show unit work total scope project design build custom bicycle
At WBS Level unit divided seven element
The number unit allocated element work based effort cost estimate task duration
The three largest element WBS Level subdivided Level
The two largest element Level represent total scope project
These larger element could subdivided using technique described
WBS design supported software
allow automatic rolling point value
Estimates effort cost developed discussion among project team member
This collaborative technique build greater insight scope definition underlying assumption consensus regarding level granularity required manage project

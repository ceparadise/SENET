This activity simulates bottleneck develop computer telephone data transmission
The activity work best child circle
Each child get letter nametag
Within circle two tennis ball labeled letter
Each child hold one ball hand pas immediate neighbor
They must try pas ball around circle everyone labeled tennis ball
However one person immediately hold letter may create bottleneck child
A simple demonstration calculating average age group child without revealing age given child used illustrate possible security measure way data might encoded protect personal information internet

After explaining neuron human brain work create artificial version programmed play snap
We test artificial brain
Also available What might Interaction future like
How might neural network used create behaviour
This short minute video demonstrates robot created University student reacts tone speaker voice
It responds changing expression suggest emotion happy sad surprised
How program robot react show emotion
What programming
The class make affective relating mood emotion robot face card tube
It programmed react different kind sound nasty nice sudden show different emotion sad happy surprised
The class think facial expression program set rule make face show appropriate sound
Also available How computer learn experience
The class challenge machine made sweet game Hexapawn little like game chess pawn board
At start machine know basic rule game
The play better get loses class punish eating sweet allowing learn mistake
A wide range computer science concept algorithm medical tomography work code interaction illustrated magic trick
Liven topic introducing using magic trick
They easy trick

The PMBOK human resource knowledge area includes four process acquire project team develop project team manage project team
As might expect human resource process cover basic management human resource theory psychology organisational behavior
The purpose management lead motivate human resource team
Everyone within project must role associated responsibility project manager responsibility define role first place carried process provide positive influence everyone working within project
Because project normally take place within matrix organization main task project manager motivate persuade people using various motivational theory leadership style differing form power
The develop human resource plan process describes project manager staff manage team build ass improve project team therefore process executed early within project performed iteratively interactively aspect planning time cost scope
This main develop human resource plan input provides information resource needed complete work activity within project
When carrying time management planning process general estimate created human resource need thoroughly evaluated estimated within process
This provide valuable information organisational structure infrastructure company value work ethic
These provide vital background performing develop human resource plan process
It may also provide marketplace information provision human resource skill example local recruitment contracting agency
These include aspect example previous similar resource project plan organisational policy procedure guideline regard human resource special corporate competence provision key knowledge skill experience project
The structure important document consists The role responsibility section define role needed project provide title describe level authority responsibility knowledge skill level competency needed order carry role within project
These used structural graphical diagram show authority reporting line within project
A key part human resource plan staffing management plan describes project staffed staff trained appropriate staff released
The latter called release plan vital project team member functional manager know staff released project
Other aspect may include safety compliance need
This form part human resource plan show resource usage given period time key considering availability staff needed This graph normally created output assigning resource activity scheduling describes resource usage given period time
To problem spotted early fixed one whether resource available two looking peak human resource period
These problematical project manager difficult manage increase management risk completing activity schedule time
You may remember S curve described characteristic nature work spend profile across project It natural work effort start slowly project peak middle project slow project come close
This peak rate work cost middle project resource used within given time frame hence show peak resource histogram
For PMP exam need know three main format The first hierarchical normally shown simple chart starting top sponsor project manager lower level arm knowing describing specialist team needed within project
The type used often called responsibility assignment matrix RAM
These shown table left hand column listing various work package remaining column describing various role
Another type often used called RACI chart describes within cell whether resource given R responsible A accountable C consult I inform
Care taken ensure one person accountable work package
This simply document describing position role within project responsibility job involves qualification needed fill position
This particular format particularly useful recruiting appropriate individual role within project
This second main output develop human resource plan process describes communication process others within network contact
The main purpose gain understanding political organisational force may influence project
Teams group behave differently work individual vital project manager understands team behave
There various study tool developed help understand organisational theory important project manager next familiar huge positive impact project helping successful

Resources broadly classified base upon availability renewable non renewable also classified actual potential basis level development use basis origin classified biotic abiotic base distribution ubiquitous localized
An item becomes resource time developing resource material energy service staff knowledge asset transformed produce benefit process may consumed made unavailable
Benefits resource utilization may include increased wealth want proper functioning system enhanced well
From perspective anything obtained satisfy human need want
From broader biological ecological perspective resource satisfies need living organism see
The concept resource applied diverse realm respect linked concept
In application within human commercial factor require
Resources three main characteristic potential
Resources variously categorized versus versus potential versus actual along elaborate classification
In resource defined service asset used produce good service meet human need want
Economics defined study society manages scarce resource
recognizes three category resource also referred land labour capital
Land includes viewed site production source
Labour consists human effort provided creation product paid
Capital consists good mean production machinery building used production good service paid
In biology ecology resource defined substance required living organism normal see
The main essential resource animal food water territory
For plant key resource include sunlight nutrient water place grow
Resources consumed organism result become unavailable organism
Competition resource vary individual receive amount resource irrespective size individual exploit amount resource per unit biomass absolutely largest individual exploit available resource
The degree size asymmetry major effect structure diversity ecological community
plant community competition light stronger effect diversity compared competition soil degree size asymmetry major effect structure diversity ecological community
There three fundamental difference economic versus ecological view economic resource definition definition economic view includes desire along necessity whereas biological view basic biological need economic system based market currency exchanged good service whereas biological system based natural process growth maintenance reproduction
A physically virtual component limited availability within system
Computer resource include mean input processing output communication storage
derived
Many natural resource essential human survival others used satisfying human desire
Conservation management goal
Natural resource may classified different way
Resources categorized basis origin Natural resource also categorized based stage development Natural resource categorized basis renewability Dependent upon speed quantity consumption overconsumption lead depletion total everlasting destruction resource
Important example agricultural area fish animal forest healthy water soil cultivated natural landscape
Such conditionally renewable resource sometimes classified third kind resource subtype renewable resource
Conditionally renewable resource presently subject excess human consumption sustainable long term use resource within wherein human use le Earth ecological capacity regenerate
Natural resource also categorized based distribution Actual potential natural resource distinguished follows On basis ownership resource classified individual community national international
In economics labour refers human effort production good rendering service
Human resource defined term skill energy talent ability knowledge
In context human resource employee responsible undertaking activity defined project plan
In refers used production
In essence capital refers resource created using knowledge expertise based utility perceived value
Common example capital include building machinery railway road ship
As resource capital good may may significantly consumed though may typically limited capacity unavailable use others
Whereas tangible resource equipment actual physical existence intangible resource corporate image brand patent intellectual property exist abstraction
Generally economic value resource controlled supply demand
Some view narrow perspective resource many intangible measured money
Natural resource forest mountain aesthetic value
Resources also ethical value
Typically resource consumed original form rather must processed usable commodity usable thing
With increasing population demand resource increasing
There marked difference associated region country developed country using natural resource developing country
pattern resource use aim meet human need preserving
Sustainable development mean exploit resource carefully meet present requirement without compromising ability future generation meet need
The practice three R reduce reuse recycle must followed order save extend availability resource
Various problem relate usage resource Various benefit result wise usage resource

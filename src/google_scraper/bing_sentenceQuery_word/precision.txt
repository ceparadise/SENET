I trying understand difference two look like calculated way
What difference
R precision R precision precision Rth position ranking result query R relevant document
Precision K Precision K calculate K document
Documents ranked lower K ignored
defined r R ratio relevant document retrieved rank equal number relevant document collection total r total number relevant document collection R
Suppose collection document total relevant R rest irrelevant
So retrieve first document relevant total collection say relevant r
Your
Precision K defined precision rank k intuitive know definition precision
Suppose system retrieves document relevant one rank want know system rank depends objective system course say want high precision low rank
So compute ratio number relevant document including rank total number document k number k
Your Precision K K therefore
Youc see measure allows assessment entire system whereas Precision K really take document K account
Depending want measure either may suitable

precision two important factor consider taking data
Both accuracy precision reflect close measurement actual value accuracy reflects close measurement known accepted value precision reflects reproducible measurement even far accepted value
You think accuracy precision term hitting bullseye
Accurately hitting target mean close center target even mark different side center
Precisely hitting target mean hit closely spaced even far center target
Measurements precise accurate repeatable near true value
There two common accuracy
In math science engineering accuracy refers close measurement true value
The ISO applies rigid definition accuracy refers measurement true consistent result
The ISO definition mean accurate measurement systematic error random error
Essentially ISO advises term accurate used measurement accurate precise
Precision consistent result measurement repeated
Precise value differ random error form observational error
You think accuracy precision term basketball player
If player always make basket even though strike different portion rim high degree accuracy
If make many basket always strike portion rim high degree precision
A player throw free throw always make basket exact way high degree accuracy precision
Take experimental measurement another example precision accuracy
If take measurement mass standard sample get value gram scale precise accurate
If scale give value accurate first balance precise
The precise scale would better use lab providing made adjustment error
An easy way remember difference accuracy precision Do think better use instrument record accurate measurement one record precise measurement
If weigh scale three time time number different yet close true weight scale accurate
Yet might better use scale precise even accurate
In case measurement would close true value amount
This common issue scale often tare button zero
While scale balance may allow tare make adjustment make measurement accurate precise many instrument require calibration
A good example thermometer
Thermometers often read reliably within certain range give increasingly inaccurate necessarily imprecise value outside range
To calibrate instrument record far measurement known true value
Keep record calibration ensure proper reading
Many piece equipment require periodic calibration ensure accurate precise reading
Accuracy precision two important concept used scientific measurement
Two important skill master
Scientists one method describing accurate precise value
It simple useful calculation
There error

I know meaning recall search engine meaning recall classifier
bayes classifier
please give example thanks
example Precision doc test data
understand recall
Recall literally
many correct hit also found
Precision formula incorrect
many found correct hit
It pretty straightforward actually
Precision ML Information Retrieval
Where TP True Positive TN True Negative FP False Positive FN False Negative
It make sense use notation usually positive le common classification
Note metric actually specific form general
Also notation precision actually In simple language For example series photo showing politician many time photo politician XY correctly recognised showing Merkel politician
precision ratio many time ANOTHER person recognized false positive Correct hit Correct hit false positive recall ratio many time name person shown photo incorrectly recognized Correct call Correct call false call I found explanation Wikipedia useful Suppose computer program recognizing dog photograph identifies dog picture containing dog cat
Of dog identified actually dog true positive rest cat false positive
The program precision recall
When search engine return page relevant failing return additional relevant page precision recall
So case
These terminology actually come signal detection theory

description measure
two definition In simplest term given set data point series measurement set said value close quantity measured set said value close quantity measured
The two concept independent particular set data said either accurate precise neither
In field accuracy system degree closeness measurement quantity true
The precision measurement system related degree repeated measurement unchanged condition show
Although two word precision accuracy use deliberately contrasted context
Interestingly field interpretation measurement play central role prefers use term instead accuracy precision bias amount inaccuracy variability amount imprecision
A measurement system accurate precise precise accurate neither
For example experiment contains increasing generally increase precision improve accuracy
The result would consistent yet inaccurate string result flawed experiment
Eliminating systematic error improves accuracy change precision
A measurement system considered
Related term include directed effect caused factor factor unrelated random variability
The terminology also applied indirect value obtained computational procedure observed data
In addition accuracy precision measurement may also smallest change underlying physical quantity produce response measurement
In accuracy also nearness calculation true value precision resolution representation typically defined number decimal binary digit
In military term accuracy refers primarily accuracy fire justesse de tir precision fire expressed closeness grouping shot around centre target
In industrial instrumentation accuracy measurement tolerance transmission instrument defines limit error made instrument used normal operating condition
Ideally measurement device accurate precise measurement close tightly clustered around true value
The accuracy precision measurement process usually established repeatedly measuring reference
Such standard defined abbreviated SI French Système international maintained national United States
This also applies measurement repeated averaged
In case term properly applied precision average equal known standard deviation process divided square root number measurement averaged
Further show averaged measurement closer normal distribution individual measurement
With regard accuracy distinguish A common convention science engineering express accuracy precision implicitly mean
Here explicitly stated margin error understood value last significant place
For instance recording would imply margin last significant place tenth place recording would imply margin error last significant digit unit
A reading trailing zero decimal point ambiguous trailing zero may may intended significant figure
To avoid ambiguity number could represented scientific notation indicates first zero significant hence margin indicates three zero significant giving margin Similarly possible use multiple basic measurement unit km equivalent In fact indicates margin km
However reliance convention lead error accepting data source obey
Precision includes A shift meaning term appeared publication ISO series standard also reflected issue BIPM International Vocabulary Metrology VIM item
According ISO general term used describe closeness measurement true value
When term applied set measurement involves component random error component systematic error
In case closeness mean set measurement result actual true value closeness agreement among set result
ISO VIM also avoid use term previously specified BS different connotation outside field science engineering medicine law
also used statistical measure well test correctly identifies excludes condition
That accuracy proportion true result among total number case examined
To make context clear semantics often referred Rand accuracy
It parameter test
In term interchangeably used
synonym
The validity measurement instrument psychological test established experiment correlation behavior
Reliability established variety statistical technique classically internal consistency test like ensure set related question related response comparison related question reference target population
In common mistake evaluation accurate model compare
This comparison difference precision accuracy
Precision measured respect detail accuracy measured respect reality
The concept accuracy precision also studied context database information system sociotechnical context
The necessary extension two concept basis theory science suggests well centered accuracy defined closeness true value seen degree agreement reading calculated value one conceived entity measured calculated different method context maximum possible disagreement

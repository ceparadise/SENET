I problem catch real meaning term
In term software development define generically
Does different meaning term different context language
Thanks
If google get amongst others following two definition seem applicable If combine two land somewhere near commonly meant talking token programming
Pretty vague yes used many different context
One example authentication system user log
When system authenticated user instead repeating process every request token created represents fact user authenticated
This token used subsequent request
In case fact user authenticated token represents fact
Tokens identifier keywords literal operator punctuators
But ca consider White space comment token though act separator token
One meaning term Software Development authentication signature issued server defined time interval In compiler Lexical analyzer scanner Reads input stream fuse character source text token language
sequence character collective meaning
The character sequence forming token called
Consider following assignment statement newvalue oldvalue rate The lexical analyzer generate following token

already pointed several definition add
In security protocol one side want make sure side opposed impostor one side previous session
Replay attack generally carried unauthorized user replaying session legitimate user try imitate
So first side sends number string supposed parrot back either securely performing kind transformation preferably requiring secret side expected
Both original item transformed item sometimes called token
However cause confusion cryptographic token RSA keyfobs generally use algorithm determine proper response display human type
So sense term often used like nonce challenge original simply response answer transformed version
Then computer networking
Granted exactly programming got program network work overlap
One style networking flow control generally considered obsolete called
Rather configuration common Ethernet day token ring arranged surprise surprise ring formation
Each station could essentially agreement among station
long since looked sure whether supposed station designate current
When done limit would token next workstation along ring defined direction
This referring seemed associated rather likely something else
As see one many word huge number definition
think least English many word could make meaning would ruin SO many good
Smallest individual element program called Token
Everything see inside program token
There generally five type token Keyword reserved word whose meaning already defined programming language
We use keyword purpose inside programming
Every programming language set keywords
Examples int void return etc Note These keywords common C C influenced language
Identifiers name given different programming element
Either name given variable function programming element follow basic naming convention listed num Num etc
number add num etc
Operators symbol given arithmetical logical operation
Various programming language provides various set operator
Separators used separate different programming element
The various type separator used programming Space Tab New line
Literals constant value used performing various operation calculation
There basically three type literal A programming token basic component source code
Characters categorized one five class token describe function constant identifier operator key word separator accordance rule programming language

I currently studying compiler construction book Compilers Principles Techniques Tools Edition page
understand kind method
E conversion pair
technical term associated
I know proper name seeing standard way lexically analyze text
You divide token specific type
For sake parsing next step parsing chain need lexeme step road need know semantic content sometimes called lexeme
For example parser care number need know number
Further road suffice know number
Even would need know integer specifically
Some lexeme example various operator though principle could group say together
We need separate syntactically different different due operator precedence
These need annotation

A token special frame passed node node around ring network
When get node need transmit data node change token data frame transmits recipient
A token essential inner working token ring network
The token handled single node time
The bearer token one allowed send data around network recipient node within network
The bearer token writes address recipient data sent sends next node series
When sender node sends token next node node read address
If node intended recipient sends data next node
Finally recipient node read data know recipient take data sends token back sender address message indicating data received
The token sent around ring reach token
After using token node release back network node able use
Although token ring transmission seems slow process user rarely notice data communication occurs rapidly

He say first pas compiler break program series token
He say check malformed token like foo C
What malformed token

An operator exist ex

Is analogous misspelled word
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
The basic syntactic unit programming language token wish word programming language
The compiler par token build sentence forth
A malformed token string character valid word programming language
It variable match naming rule token variable
It operator unknown sometimes operator defined programmer
It one smallest piece syntax never correspond something sensible

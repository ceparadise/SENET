Draw Entity Relationship Data Model describes content structure data held Petcare
Specify cardinality ratio participation constraint relationship type
To design database system Petcare need draw Entity Relationship Diagram show entity relationship enteritis
The ERD model static relationship amongst information preserved maintained database
The ERD show item data relate statically
First step need define entity database
According requirement Petcare entity involved database system record Petcare information Information pet included type breed sex age owner Information pet owner included name address home telephone number mobile telephone number Information included pet appointment owner pet particular branch Petcare attending veterinary Veterinarian date time appointment
Information veterinary Veterinarian included name address home telephone number mobile telephone number branch report specialize
The outcome appointment included prescription charge made
Next step define relationship entity
The relationship included Participation Constraint Cardinality Ratio
There two type participation constraint named participation
A participation mandatory participation constraint specifies every member entity must participate member another linked entity generalization
A participation optional participation constraint specifies member entity belong member another linked entity generalization
Three type cardinality described Relation two entity linked primary key
M N Relation two entity linked without primary key
It also chance create redundancy error
Therefore better break two relation
M Relation two entity linked primary key foreign key
The relationship Pet The pet raised owner pet owner owner keep pet
The owner also keep difference kind pet
There fore relationship Pet Owner Total one many
Relationship Owner The pet owner would make appointment Veterinarian
In real case owner would make appointment also Veterinarian also handle case
A relational database allowed condition
To solve issue another entity added Owner Veterinarian
The Owner may make appointment visit veterinarian also also without appointment
In order simple database design see also new appointment
Therefore relationship Owner Appointment Total one many
Relationship Appointment appointment created pet owner handled Veterinarian
However Veterinarian may respond special case would handle appointment
Therefore relationship Appointment Veterinarian Partial many one relationship
Relationship Veterinarian On already mentioned Veterinarian would attend one appointment
Also Veterinarian would issue diagnosis
Diagnosis outcome appointment issued veterinarian
The relationship Veterinarian Diagnosis Total one many
According entity relationship design got first ERD The ERD showed logical database design Petcare
The ERD identifies list data element must included database
Fig

The ERD Petcare
Produce resulting normalized table clearly indicating primary foreign key
After complete logical design database draw ERD start physical design database
The first thing create table define need store database
A good database design make content table related entity
In order meet requirement normalization process implemented
The normalization process need step step transform database step specify name called Form UNF First Normal Form Second Normal Form Third Normal Form Normal Form BCNF The step carried normalization
Collect Transform form table first normal form Transform first normal form table second normal form Transform second normal form table third normal form According ERD design requirement Petcare Tables database created also attribute added indentify
PetID attribute also Primary table
Fig

The Form table The table included requested data information requested Petcare
However attribute difference table
The table form table
We need make content table related entity
Therefore normalization process implemented
The first step transforming form table first normal form
The definition first normal form attribute relation functionally dependent upon primary key
According definition first normal form avulse attribute relate primary key create another table attribute
For example table Veterinarian Branch Specialise related Primary key need avulse attribute create another table Branch Specialise
Another table Diagnosis also issue
Fig

Normalized table Fig
Normalized table After process first normalized got First Normal Form table Fig

First Normal Form table The second step transfer first normal form second normal form
The definition second normal form relation first normal form every attribute fully functionally dependent primary key
After second normalization got table Fig

Second Normalized table The definition third normal form relation second normal form every attribute dependent primary key
Because second normalized table already meet equipment
Therefore third normal form
The next step design physical database defining Primary Key Foreign key
This step also defining relationship table
The Primary Key used identify record table
The Foreign Key key attribute link table
The final normalized table detail relationship Primary key Foreign key showed diagram
Fig

Final table design The last step design database define property attribute
The property attribute design coding attribute
A good coding design important good coding design let use easy understand take le mistake input data also determined usability extensibility database
A good coding design meet requirement Uniqueness one value code may applied entity
Expandability must sufficient space entry new item
Conciseness use minimum number character define item
Uniform size format addition prefix suffix
Simplicity simple apply understand
Versatility easy modify change condition
Sortability may code long correlated sortable code
Stability need regular updating costly
Meaningful circumstance useful code reflect characteristic coded entity
Operability code sufficient meet current future need data identification also minimise clerical system resource required operate
Other coding design sequence table create also important table may relation table
We first create table relate table create table relate table
The sequence table create list sequence Data dictionary
According requirement table attribute created detail listed Data Dictionary OwnerID char PK The ID owner char Not NULL Name owner varchar NULL Address owner char NULL Phone number owner char NULL Mobile number owner TypeID char PK The ID pet type char Not NULL name pet type BreedID char PK The ID breed type char Not NULL Name Breed type TypeID char FK relate PetType PetID char PK The ID Pet OwnerID char FK relate Owner PetName char Not NULL Name pet Sex char Not NULL sex pet Age numeric Not NULL age pet Breedid char FK relate Breed BranchID char PK The ID branch char Not NULL Name branch char Not NULL Address branch char Not NULL Phone number branch SpeID char PK The ID specialize Specialise char Not NULL Name specialization VetID char PK The ID veterinaria char Not NULL Name veterinaria varchar Not NULL Address veterinaria char Not NULL Phone number veterinaria char Not NULL Mobile number veterinaria SpecID char FK relate Specialisation BranchID char Not NULL The branch veterinaria working AppID char PK The ID appointment VetID char FK relate Veterinarian OwnerID char FK relate owner BranchID char FK relate Branch PetID char FK relate Pet Date date Not NULL date appointment Time time Not NULL time appointment char PK The ID Drug Type char Not NULL Name drug type DrugID char PK The ID drug char FK relate DrugType DrugName char Not NULL Name drug Category char Not NULL How use drug Period char Not NULL Number day use drug PrescID char PK The ID Prescription char FK relate Drug char FK relate Drug char FK relate Drug DiagID char PK The ID diagnosis VelID char FK relate Velerinarian PrescID char FK relate Prescription Price Numeric Not NULL The price diagnosis Using Database Management System DBMS normalized table populate test After completely designed database start create
Concerning popularity easy use determined use Microsoft Access Database Management System DBMS Petcare database
We use SQL command create table attribute relationship table
The SQL command create table list CREATE TABLE Owner OwnerID CHAR PRIMARY KEY CHAR VARCHAR CHAR CHAR CREATE TABLE PetType TypeID CHAR PRIMARY KEY CHAR CREATE TABLE Breed BreedID CHAR PRIMARY KEY CHAR TypeID CHAR REFERENCES PetType TypeID ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE CREATE TABLE Pet PetID CHAR PRIMARY KEY OwnerID CHAR REFERENCES Owner OwnerID ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE PetName CHAR Sex CHAR Age NUMERIC BreedID CHAR REFERENCES Breed BreedID ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE All table also used similar SQL command create would repeat
After table attribute relationship created
The whole table diagram showed figure

Draw Entity Relationship Data Model describes content construction information held Petcare
Stipulate cardinality ratio engagement restraint relationship type
To plan database system Petcare need pull Entity Relationship Diagram demo entity relationship enteritis
The ERD theoretical account inactive relationship amongst information preserved maintained database
The ERD show point information relate statically
First measure need specify entity database
Harmonizing demand Petcare entity involved database system enter Petcare information Information pet included type strain sex age proprietor Information pet proprietor included name reference place telephone figure nomadic telephone figure Information included pet assignment proprietor pet peculiar subdivision Petcare go toing veterinary Veterinarian day month clip assignment
Information veterinary Veterinarian included name reference place telephone figure nomadic telephone figure branch report specialize
The result assignment included prescription charge made
Following measure specify relationship entity
The relationship included Participation Constraint Cardinality Ratio
There two type engagement restraint named Total Partial engagement
A Total engagement compulsory engagement restraint specifies every member entity must take part member another linked entity generalisation
A Partial engagement optional engagement restraint specifies member entity non belong member another linked entity generalisation
Three type cardinality described Relation two entity linked primary key merely
M N Relation two entity linked without primary key
It besides opportunity make redundancy mistake
Therefore better interrupt two dealings
Meter Relation two entity linked primary key foreign key
The relationship Pet The pet raised proprietor pet merely hold proprietor proprietor maintain pet
The proprietor besides maintain difference sort pet
There forward relationship Pet Owner Entire one many
Relationship Owner The pet proprietor would assignment Veterinarian
In existent instance proprietor would assignment besides Veterinarian besides non manage instance merely
A relational database non allowed status
To work issue another entity Appointment added Owner Veterinarian
The Owner may assignment visit veterinary besides besides without assignment
In order simple database design see besides new assignment
Therefore relationship Owner Appointment Entire one many
Relationship Appointment assignment created pet proprietor handled Veterinarian
However Veterinarian may react particular instance would non manage assignment
Therefore relationship Appointment Veterinarian Partial many one relationship
Relationship Veterinarian On already mentioned Veterinarian would go one assignment
Besides Veterinarian would publish diagnosing
Diagnosis result assignment issued veterinary
The relationship Veterinarian Diagnosis Entire one many
Harmonizing entity relationship design got first ERD The ERD showed logical database design Petcare
The ERD identifies list information element must included database

An describes thing interest specific domain knowledge
An ER model composed entity type classify thing interest specifies relationship exist instance entity type
In ER model commonly formed represent thing business need remember order perform business process
Consequently ER model becomes abstract defines data information structure implemented typically
modeling developed database design published paper
However variant idea existed previously
Some ER modeler show super subtype entity connected relationship ER model used also specification
An model usually result systematic analysis define describe important process area business
It define business process present business data schema graphical form
It usually drawn graphical form box connected line express association dependency entity
An ER model also expressed verbal form example Entities may characterized relationship also additional property include identifier called primary key
Diagrams created represent attribute well entity relationship may called diagram rather model
An ER model typically implemented
In simple relational database implementation row table represents one instance entity type field table represents attribute type
In relationship entity implemented storing primary key one entity pointer foreign key table another entity There tradition model built two three level abstraction
Note hierarchy used kind specification different
The first stage design us model describe information need type stored
The technique used describe
overview classification used term relationship certain
In case design information system based database later stage usually called logical design mapped turn mapped physical model physical design
Note sometimes phase referred physical design
An may defined thing capable independent existence uniquely identified
An entity abstraction complexity domain
When speak entity normally speak aspect real world distinguished aspect real world
An entity thing exists either physically logically
An entity may physical object house car exist physically event house sale car service concept customer transaction order exist concept
Although term entity one commonly used following Chen really distinguish entity
An category
An entity strictly speaking instance given
There usually many instance
Because term somewhat cumbersome people tend use term entity synonym term
Entities thought
Examples computer employee song mathematical theorem
A relationship capture entity related one another
Relationships thought linking two noun
Examples relationship company computer relationship employee department relationship artist song relationship mathematician conjecture
The model linguistic aspect described utilized database ERROL mimic construct
ERROL implementation based RRA relational algebra adapted model capture linguistic aspect
Entities relationship attribute
Examples entity might SSN attribute relationship may attribute
Every entity unless must minimal set uniquely identifying attribute called entity
diagram show single entity single instance relation
Rather show entity set entity entity type relationship set relationship relationship type
Example particular entity
The collection song database entity set
The relationship child lunch single relationship
The set relationship database relationship set
In word relationship set corresponds relationship corresponds member relation
Certain relationship set may indicated well
Chen proposed following rule thumb mapping natural language description ER diagram Peter Chen
Physical view show data actually stored
In Chen original paper give example relationship role
He describes relationship marriage two role husband wife
A person play role husband marriage relationship another person play role wife marriage
These word noun
That surprise naming thing requires noun
Chen terminology also applied earlier idea
The line arrow diagram owes earlier Chen relationship diagram
Another common extension Chen model name relationship role verb phrase
It also become prevalent name role phrase
Correct noun case
Thus rather etc
The use noun direct benefit generating physical implementation semantic model
When two relationship possible generate name immediately meaningful
Modifications original specification beneficial
Chen described
As aside notation used Oracle Designer us minimum cardinality analogous optionality role maximum cardinality crow foot
In Elmasri Navathe others preference role minimum maximum cardinality
Recent researcher Feinerer Dullea et al
shown coherent applied relationship order greater
In Dullea et al
one read A across notation used UML effectively represent semantics participation constraint imposed relationship degree higher binary
In Feinerer say Problems arise operate semantics used UML association
Hartmann investigates situation show different transformation fail
also As see next page interpretation introduces several difficulty prevent extension simple mechanism binary association
Chen notation modeling us rectangle represent entity set diamond represent relationship appropriate attribute relationship
If entity set participates relationship set connected line
Attributes drawn oval connected line exactly one entity relationship set
Cardinality constraint expressed follows Attributes often omitted clutter diagram diagram technique often list entity attribute within rectangle drawn entity set
Related diagramming convention technique Crow foot notation beginning date back article Gordon Everest used SSADM
Crow foot diagram represent entity box relationship line box
Different shape end line represent cardinality relationship
Crow foot notation used consultancy practice
Many consultant CACI including Richard Barker subsequently moved UK developed early version Oracle tool introducing notation wider audience
With notation relationship attribute
Where necessary relationship promoted entity right example necessary capture artist performed song new entity performance introduced attribute reflecting time place relationship artist song becomes indirect relationship via performance
In using modeled database user encounter two well known issue returned result mean something result assumed query author
The first trap
It occurs master table linking multiple table relationship
The issue derives name way model look draw diagram linked table master table
This type model look similar type model used
When trying calculate sum aggregate using standard SQL master table get unexpected incorrect result explanation missing
The solution either adjust model SQL
This issue occurs mostly database decision support system software query system sometimes includes specific method handling issue
The second issue trap
A chasm trap occurs model suggests existence relationship entity type pathway exist certain entity occurrence
For example Building Rooms hold Computers
You would expect able query model see Computers Building
However Computers currently assigned Room repair somewhere else shown list
You need another relation Building Computers capture computer building
This last modelling issue result failure capture relationship exist real world model
See detail
A semantic model model concept sometimes called platform independent model
It intensional model
At latest since well known An extensional model one map element particular methodology technology thus platform specific model
The UML specification explicitly state association class model extensional fact considering extensive array additional adornment provided specification provided prior candidate semantic modelling language
Peter Chen father ER modeling said seminal paper In original article Chen explicitly contrast diagram record modelling technique Several author also support Chen program Chen accord philosophic theoretical tradition time Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates Plato Aristotle BC modern
associate knowledge apprehension unchanging Forms The form according Socrates roughly speaking archetype abstract representation many type thing property relationship one another

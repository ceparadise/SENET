In five year I teaching computer programming high school student I always one goal mind demystify computer make working capability understandable broad cross section student population possible
Given ever increasing importance electronic digital computer almost every aspect life I see understanding prerequisite full democratic participation creation collective future
Toward achieving goal I embarked three seperate project The Linux lab set durning summer use Yorktown High School computer science program five half year
We began using Python Fall mid way third year learning programming Python
The XP project getting ground
The common thread run project ability collaboration computer professional using Internet communication greatly enhance learning opportunity high school computer science student teacher
Relying good support free software Python XP community I able transform computer science curriculum
While I often recieved encouragement support material moral Yorktown parent principal I embarked curriculum development project initiative without official instruction school system
My desire introduce extreme programming concept classroom stem goal drive first place able bring student diverse background skill interest firm understanding computer use practice computer programming help student develop logical thinking
The computer programming process sorely lacking computer programming text
These book focus extensively syntax symantics programming language question say almost nothing go writing program
For strong student naturally drawn programming problem
These student able write program seeing example program written others
I understand able somehow grasp rule language seeing
They able make original program know rule game watching played
For student get hand little help available
Often attitude seems similar expressed toward learning mathematics
You either programmer find something else
I desperately seeking effective way situation
I wanted able bring understanding computer programming much broader audience I currently reaching
I first became aware extreme programming annual Python conference I attended
XP big Python community active XPers conference
I attracted immediately XP represented analysis programming process
Understanding process point view programmer clearly key effectly teaching student successful programming
The I learned XP I attracted
The four XP principle communication simplicity feedback courage seemed tailor made classroom
While I see direct relevance learning environment XP practice practice small release metaphor simple design testing refactoring pair programming collective ownership coding standard offered value student
Last year I rearranged room put student together two computer
This pair programming point first awkward step toward incorporating something I learned XP classroom
What I really hoping mentor someone interested seeing XP used educational setting would take time guide student using
My hope answered person Steve Howell
Steve professional programmer mentoring two top student project create Python implementation Karel Robot
That project come along nicely available
Steve lived Seattle mentoring going net
That changed last summer Steve first visited moved Washington DC area
We began schedule code fests school Steve visited Yorktown worked student directly project
Steve master teacher watching work student taught two important thing I learned pair programming supposed work I introduced simple testing framework I felt I could use class test first programming
This year student working way could legitimately called pair programming
We discussed goal concept behind two people actively programming together one driving navigates
I keep watch process ask pair let partner drive I see thing balanced
The student keep daily journal I read many encouraging entry reflecting process
Ever since I decided try test driven development classroom biggest problem I faced finding testing framework suitable environment
All unit test framework I seen way complicated use introductory class
We still simple proceedural programming goal teach student write effective function
A testing framework required creation class would add confusion clarity defeating goal project
Steve came rescue well
He used simple function testing told thought needed
It revelation allowed get handle test first process without frustrated trying figure write run test
Below I using class
It modified version one I watched Steve using This function put Linux terminal server directory Students import anywhere system
In preperation first test driven development project I gave student following assignment Research Test Driven Development Test First Design write description programmer using
Your discussion include Kent Beck Ward Cunningham well brief mention principle eXtreme Programming XP
Be sure describe four core value twelve practice XP
I encouraged student reaction assignment
Almost found good background information put website
They seemed genuinely interested idea XP
I overheard one student telling partner apparent enthusiasm philosophy behind In introducing test driven design I decided use programming problem problem written fellow Python teacher Tim Wilson
The basic idea problem create interactive translator prompt user English sentence phrase convert input Pig Latin
The sample session look like This problem particularly easy use test driven development
To get thing started I demonstrated using test driven development sub problem writing function take English word argument return Pig Latin prefix word
The demonstration went something like The next time class met I told turn use I shown write two new function return part word prefix take English word return Pig Latin translation capitalized first letter trailing punctuation mark preserved
I scheduled part project double period block day student would time needed get process
My first period class would double period Wednesday second period would double period Thursday
This gave added advantage time make adjustment Thursday thing go well Wednesday
As turned I need make adjustment
Each class kind class teacher dream
All student actively engaged programming entire ninty minute class
Several pair kept working bell rang working break
I joked one student told cried earlier felt happy made function pas test
You laughed cried I said class experience
In reflecting afterwards made class succesful I realized test driven development proven useful way I anticipated
I started experiment premise would help student focus supposed give better understanding problem trying solve
In frequent discussion student class difficulty getting started solving problem I noticed often real grasp supposed
By write test began would forced think expected input output function writing helping bridge important gap understanding
Indeed happened
More student able successfully complete task usual lost expression accompanied I know common earlier project practically disappeared
Yet even exciting unforeseen benefit test driven development
During second day student writing test function would call thought finished
I would say let see test looking test suite I would sit add test thought walk away smile
Rising challenge would fix code pas new test call process repeated several time
What I found novel experience new effective process communication developing student precise succinct
By typing one line test I communicated effectively I wanted several paragraph explaination
Judging atmosphere classroom excited power new form communication I
The experience fun exciting student clarified programming process
They could see clearly supposed received immediate feedback test whether successful
This gave whole process atmosphere game made rewarding empowering experience
After two day using test driven development certainly early draw definitive conclusion even early stage result successful enough make glad I embarked experiment
If result past week indication using test driven development introductory programming class may prove key I looking help student become successful programming

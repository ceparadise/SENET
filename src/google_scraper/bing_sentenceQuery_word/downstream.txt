In refers data sent customer
Although best called downstream speed limited ten even lower speed
ADSL two popular technology greatly improved downstream speed reaching several
provider also often lower upstream speed downstream
One process sending data primarily downstream direction
However overall download speed depends downstream speed user upstream speed network
In downstream refer direction server

In information technology refers transfer speed usually connection data sent
The process downstream utilized known
In US optimal connection able send kilobit per second client
Asymmetrical DSL Cable Modems two popular broadband service world today greatly improved downstream speed comparison k speed reaching
However overall download speed file dependent downstream user upstream server

Downstream transmission
A downstream transmission form signal transmitted server across signal sent cable service provider customer
A transmission end user server referred

organization tend use nomenclature downstream upstream talk communication system
What definition concept
Is standard concept world
To simplify thing let say talking system Upstream Something depends S Downstream Something S depends I know old I think answer wrong way around
Think way upstream something affect equally something upstream affect something downstream ca
So use method given system S Upstream something S depends action flow S Downstream something depends S S action flow By posting answer agree

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What design software development mean
This question came site linguist etymologist serious English language enthusiast
Upstream component part system component depends job
If design upstream component change ability component function may affected
If upstream component bug bug may manifested component
Downstream component part system component affect
Changes component ripple component downstream component
Consider application consists database tier application tier
The database tier would considereded upstream application tier
Upstream well origin software Downstream downwards ocean use case Open Source developer downstream build application tool finished product
Those upstream actually work product released
If develop software depend stability upstream development
And work software downstream developer
I think software engineering jargon English way I understand downstream design application developer take tool already developed use complete application
Using already produced software library decision library capability would already made downstream
With upstream design application developer consulted involved development library application work even really begun
If going software company focusing audio software example might need develop library cover range software plan develop
It would nice able library developer sit application developer app devs provide input want
Upstream customized make much expensive potentially produce better end product
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

In computer network upstream refers sending data client local computer server remote host
Upstream transmission take several form speed data transferred local machine server known upstream rate
Upstream opposite downstream refers data transferred server local machine
When referring Internet node node closer Internet backbone said upstream node farther away backbone
Upstream traffic generated uploading file sending email server
Upstream also refer signal transmitted end user computer cable service provider
Moreover upstream speed extremely important software user
Typically downstream traffic voluminous upstream traffic
Asymmetric DSL service render slower upstream speed downstream speed
This done reserving le bandwidth upstream traffic providing bandwidth downstream traffic

upstream getting stuff ground mid stream moving stuff well refining processing place downstream turning stuff useful stuff refinery cracking mechanical sure could
machinery get oil ground machinery move oil A B machinery turn oil plastic fuel
source mom R D downstream engineer top oil company lived near refinery year OK Thanks nice simple

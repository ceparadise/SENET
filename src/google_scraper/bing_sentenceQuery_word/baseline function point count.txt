Function Point Overview available

In baseline agreed description attribute product point time serf basis defining change
A change movement baseline next state
The identification significant change baseline state central purpose identification
Typically significant state receive formal approval status either explicitly implicitly
An approval status may marked individually prior definition status established project leader signified association position established baseline
Nevertheless approval status usually recognized publicly
Thus baseline may also mark approved configuration item
signed execution
In similar manner associating multiple configuration item baseline indicates item approved
Generally baseline may single work product set work product used logical basis comparison
A baseline may also established basis subsequent select activity work product meet certain criterion
Such activity may attributed formal approval
Conversely configuration project often includes one baseline status configuration metric collected
The current configuration refers current status current audit current metric
Similarly le frequently baseline may refer item associated specific project
This may include revision item latest revision item project depending upon context
A baseline may specific type baseline body item particular certifying
Some example include While marking approval status cover majority us baseline baseline may also established signify progress work passage time
In case baseline visible measure endured collective effort
developmental baseline
Baselines may also mark
Baselines valued use identify notable state work product also provide historical view work product element proceeded together time
When historical baseline retrieved state work product subset share significance history change allows project leader compare relative progress single part project project whole allows project leader identify individual item lag lead progress toward better functionality performance
For reason baseline identification monitoring retrieval critical success configuration management
Once retrieved baseline may compared particular configuration another baseline
Most baseline established fixed point time serve continue reference point identification state
However baseline established carry forward reference item regardless change item
These latter baseline evolve progression work effort continue identify notable work product project
In process performing configuration management configuration item work product may assigned baseline establish certain status
In sense baseline work product may require certain change work product ensure conforms characteristic associated baseline referenced
This varies upon context many case requires work product reset initial possibly inherently approved state work may proceed
In many environment baseline controlled certain subsequent activity work product baseline either prohibited permitted
These activity selected controlled depending upon configuration management system also monitored
Consequently baseline ordinarily subjected configuration management audit
may include examination specific action performed baseline identification individual involved action evaluation change within baseline certification approval accounting metric collection comparison another baseline
Though common software system label existence baseline found several domain
Baselines found modeling system business rule management system among others
In addition field hardware software engineering baseline found medicine
monitoring health progress politics
statistic physic chemistry

Function Points counted phase development project requirement including implementation
This type count associated new development work
Scope creep tracked monitored understanding functional size phase project
Frequently type count called baseline function point count
It common enhance software placed production
This type function point count try size enhancement project
All production application evolve time
By tracking enhancement size associated cost historical database organization built
Additionally important understand Development project changed time
Application count done existing production application
This baseline count used overall application metric like total maintenance hour
This metric used track maintenance hour per function point
This example normalized metric
It enough examine maintenance one must examine ratio maintenance hour size application get true picture
The definition productivity ratio within time period due consideration quality
The formula indicates productivity improved increasing output input decreasing input maintaining output increasing output decreasing input change ratio favorably
Productivity implies effectiveness efficiency individual organizational performance
Effectiveness achievement objective
Efficiency achievement end least amount resource
Software productivity defined point function
This average cost develop software unit cost software
One thing keep mind unit cost software fixed size
What industry data show unit cost software go size
Average cost total cost producing particular quantity output divided quantity
In case
Marginal cost change total cost attributable change output
There variety reason marginal cost software increase size increase
The following list reason Function Points output software development process
Function point unit software
It important understand Function Points remain constant regardless develops software language software developed
Unit cost need examined closely
To calculate average unit cost item unit combined divided total cost
On hand accurately estimate cost application component cost need estimated
To complete function point count knowledge function point rule application documentation needed
Access application expert improve quality count
Once application boundary established FPA broken three major part Rating transaction dependent information contained transaction number file referenced recommended transaction counted first
At time tally kept FTR file type referenced transaction reference
Every FTR must least one transaction
Each transaction must elementary process
An elementary process smallest unit activity meaningful end user business
It must leave business consistent state The function point method originaly developed Bij Albrecht

Find best broker trading investing need A baseline used foundation measuring comparing current past value
For example company wanting measure success one use number unit sold first year baseline evaluate subsequent sale growth
The baseline considered starting point measured
A baseline form measurement used comparison analysis
It clearly defined starting point new strategy implemented existing improvement judged comparison two period made
If want analyze profit example choose one year profit baseline judge subsequent year baseline analyzing potential reason behind positive negative change
A baseline specifically used situation person company conducting financial statement budget analysis
analysis us ratio accounting number baseline
Budget analysis us existing revenue spending baseline assessing whether project budgeted implemented successfully
us baseline called
This type analysis compare company historical financial information number reporting period either monthly quarterly annually
The first period horizontal analysis denoted baseline period
All subsequent period measured percentage baseline
So period revenue baseline example would revenue
The idea spot trend look growth ass financial performance
Ratios like also compared horizontally baseline year analyze company performance
A baseline project budgeting known cost baseline
This type baseline approved plan outline cost project detail cost category cost per period time
The baseline budget project implementation judged
If company opening new warehouse cost baseline set month month monthly cost excess
However project cost always fluctuate unknown expense realized
When cost become unavoidable cost baseline updated reflect accuracy project cost
The baseline also point reference evaluating project effect spending
If cost baseline high expected revenue project red flag

In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

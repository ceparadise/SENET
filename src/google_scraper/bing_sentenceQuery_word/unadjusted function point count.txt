A unit measurement express amount business functionality product provides user
Function point used compute functional size measurement FSM software
The cost dollar hour single unit calculated past project
As several recognized standard public specification sizing software based Function Point
open membership computer industry standard consortium adopted Automated Function Point AFP specification led
It provides standard automating Function Point counting according guideline International Function Point User Group However current implementation standard limitation able distinguish External Output EO External Inquiries EQ box without upfront configuration
Function point defined Allan Albrecht
The software identified one categorized one five type output inquiry input internal file external interface
Once function identified categorized type assessed complexity assigned number function point
Each functional user requirement map business function data entry Input user query Inquiry
This distinction important tends make function measured function point map easily requirement also tends hide internal function
algorithm also require resource implement
There currently ISO recognized FSM Method includes algorithmic complexity sizing result
Recently different approach proposed deal perceived weakness implemented several commercial software product
The variation IFPUG method designed make weakness include The use function point favor line code seek address several additional issue Albrecht observed research Function Points highly correlated line code resulted questioning value measure objective measure namely counting line code available
In addition multiple attempt address perceived shortcoming measure augmenting counting regimen
Others offered solution circumvent challenge developing alternative method create proxy amount functionality delivered

Software Cost Duration Estimation important factor Software Development Organizations one major specialization area software engineering research
Project Planning phase start estimate cost effort date schedule duration resource
Different technique proposed calculate rough exact cost software initial stage software development
As I mentioned chapter three method metric metric Line Source code per programming month
According instead giving answer software measurement needed focus need software measurement
Function Point goal determine functionality calculating complexity application line code
The reason behind choose Function Point Analysis enhance experience knowledge exploring area
Software development organization usually us Line Code method mostly developer aware technique
But interesting thing seen Function Point give almost exact cost precisely determine scope boundary major component
Internal Logical File External Interface File External Input External Output External Queries
FPA give estimate independent technology going use developing application
According IFPUG Reference guide another interesting thing notable FPA conducted language independent Information Technology jargon
language understandable user system developer
The important contribution Function Point thesis give confidence I go research software engineering field term Software Cost Duration Estimation
International Function Point User Group IFPUG worked hard introduce Function Point Analysis technique decompose attribute functional level classify data type data function transactional function point
Before decomposing functionality application boundary identified
Application boundary scope application
Function point basically integer assigned function comparing complexity data type complexity matrix
Hence get unadjusted function point count multiplied constant factor resulting value added factor sum point
The final figure total function point count
Software Measurement divided three tier according audience software organization Project Management Middle Management Senior Management
Project Management mostly dealing function point effort defect schedule compliance
Middle Management focusing productivity cost monitoring efficiency performance whereas Senior Management responsible time market customer satisfaction cost saving
There various technique cost estimation question arises professional technical manager avoid software estimating technique
Among reason important one lack clear communication customer software professional manager
I would go deep detail function point analysis
If I would jump detail FPA whole chapter would include definition explanation
Where necessary I would explain meaning relevance FPA term respect context
I would use methodology function point next section
For reader newbie FPA technique well aware Function Point Analysis please read tutorial mentioned

Improvement coding tool allows software developer produce large amount software meet ever expanding need user
As system grow method understand communicate size need used
Function Point Analysis structured technique problem solving
It method break system smaller component better understood analyzed
Function point unit measure software much like hour measuring time mile measuring distance Celsius measuring temperature
Function Points ordinal measure much like measure kilometer Fahrenheit hour forth Human being solve problem breaking smaller understandable piece
Problems may appear difficult simple broken smaller part dissected class
Classifying thing placing category familiar process
Everyone one time another shopkeeper take stock shelf librarian catalog book secretary file letter document
When object classified content system set definition rule must used place object appropriate category scheme classification
Function Point Analysis structured technique classifying component system
It method break system smaller component better understood analyzed
It provides structured technique problem solving
In world Function Point Analysis system divided five large class general system characteristic
The first three class component External Inputs External Outputs External Inquires component transact file therefore called transaction
The next two Internal Logical Files External Interface Files data stored combined form logical information
The general system characteristic ass general functionality system
Brief History Function Point Analysis developed first Allan Albrecht mid
It attempt overcome difficulty associated line code measure software size assist developing mechanism predict effort associated software development
The method first published later
In Albrecht refined method since International Function Point User Group IFPUG set several version Function Point Counting Practices Manual published IFPUG
The current version IFPUG Manual
A full downloaded website
Objectives Function Point Analysis Frequently term end user user used without specifying meant
In case user sophisticated user
Someone would understand system functional perspective likely someone would provide requirement acceptance testing
Since Function Points measure system functional perspective independent technology
Regardless language development method hardware platform used number function point system remain constant
The variable amount effort needed deliver given set function point therefore Function Point Analysis used determine whether tool environment language productive compared others within organization among organization
This critical point one greatest value Function Point Analysis
Function Point Analysis provide mechanism track monitor scope creep
Function Point Counts end requirement analysis design code testing implementation compared
The function point count end requirement design compared function point actually delivered
If project grown scope creep
The amount growth indication well requirement gathered communicated project team
If amount growth project decline time natural assumption communication user improved
Characteristic Quality Function Point Analysis Function Point Analysis performed trained experienced personnel
If Function Point Analysis conducted untrained personnel reasonable assume analysis done incorrectly
The personnel counting function point utilize current version Function Point Counting Practices Manual Current application documentation utilized complete function point count
For example screen format report layout listing interface system system logical preliminary physical data model assist Function Points Analysis
The task counting function point included part overall project plan
That counting function point scheduled planned
The first function point count developed provide sizing used estimating
The Five Major Components Since common computer system interact computer system boundary must drawn around system measured prior classifying component
This boundary must drawn according point view
In short boundary indicates border project application measured external application user domain
Once border established component classified ranked tallied
elementary process data cross boundary outside inside
This data may come data input screen another application
The data may used maintain one internal logical file
The data either control information business information
If data control information update internal logical file
The graphic represents simple EI update ILF FTR

elementary process derived data pass across boundary inside outside
Additionally EO may update ILF
The data creates report output file sent application
These report file created one internal logical file external interface file
The following graphic represents EO FTR derived information green derived ILF elementary process input output component result data retrieval one internal logical file external interface file
The input process update Internal Logical Files output side contain derived data
The graphic represents EQ two ILF derived data
user identifiable group logically related data resides entirely within application boundary maintained external input
user identifiable group logically related data used reference purpose
The data resides entirely outside application maintained another application
The external interface file internal logical file another application
After component classified one five major component ranking low average high assigned
For transaction ranking based upon number file updated referenced number data element type
For file ranking based upon record element type data element type
A record element type user recognizable subgroup data element within ILF EIF
A data element type unique user recognizable non recursive field
Each following table assist ranking process numerical rating parenthesis
For example EI reference update File Types Referenced data element would assigned ranking average associated rating
Where combined number Internal Logical Files referenced updated External Interface Files referenced
Like component rated scored
Basically EQ rated Low Average High like EO assigned value like EI
The rating based upon total number unique combined unique input side data element file type referenced combined unique input output side
If FTR used input output side counted one time
If DET used input output side counted one time
For number record element type number data element type used determine ranking low average high
A Record Element Type user recognizable subgroup data element within ILF EIF
A Data Element Type DET unique user recognizable non recursive field ILF EIF
The count level complexity type component entered table following one
Each count multiplied numerical rating shown determine rated value
The rated value row summed across table giving total value type component
These total summed across table giving total value type component
These total summoned arrive Total Number Unadjusted Function Points

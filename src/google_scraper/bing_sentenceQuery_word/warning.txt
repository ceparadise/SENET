When Shlomo Zippel got first job programming
And pretty much end academic career
I arrangement principal long I showed test well would tell parent I school recall Zippel
Instead getting school bus every morning I got normal bus took office I worked
Zippel lived Israel time developing software used major bank country plus Reuters Israel
At hourly rate Zippel making coding higher parent
My dad surgeon Zippel say
This might say little doctor paid Israel though
The tech world filled famous dropout
David Karp instance ditched high school never graduated
Instead created Tumblr later sold Yahoo billion
Mark Zuckerberg left Harvard University sophomore year mirroring another famous Harvard dropout Bill Gates
Tech billionaire Peter Thiel also vocal critic college famously offering selected student drop college instead focus developing idea
Michael Solomon founder represents coder note many degree major computer science
One biggest issue education technology industry ability keep curriculum current cusp technology say Erik Zuuring programmer dropped college
Just trend technology change monthly basis
See also You get computer science degree four year debt still know everything need code say Jordyn Lee rep curator online alternative education source
Zippel say also run across comp sci graduate could code
When I new employee company fresh CS degree
I shocked really know program
I remember I decided I probably would go school
What point
The computer science degree defender course
Don Burks head instructor programming boot camp say people create next version Windows OSX next Android phone likely studied computer science
It fantastic going become computer scientist say referring comp sci degree
But someone want build website SaaS product work startup need point practical understanding
Beyond though deep understanding computer science help become better programmer say Yuri Niyazov Ruby Rails
say
Sure professional experience I asked build another Rails app brings content database browser someone read book probably good I
However time come fix database browser number tool involved process theoretical underpinnings computer science became quite As Danny Sleator professor computer science coach programming team Carnegie Mellon one nation top computer science school acknowledges lot stuff teach may end running might
That may seem faint promise justify cost degree
Not surprisingly many affinity coding opting alternative traditional degree like online course boot camp
The former seem viable alternative except one thing Their woeful completion rate
According SkilledUp people sign online course finish completion
If pay course figure double
Boot camp much higher completion rate
Relatedly demand much bigger commitment
Because require physical presence sometimes move attend
The cost also range high though average lot lower program even pay attend accepted
An exhaustive list dozen boot camp program found
They call boot camp nothing though
Lighthouse instance program day cost
The placement rate going make week year coop position
After salary range Burks say
CodeFellows another boot camp program guarantee job making graduate
Such program viewed entry point junior position work way
Solomon coder make per hour usually five year coding experience
From could course found startup become fabulously wealthy make decent living programmer
However facing graduate top computer science school regardless level coding proficiency may get job offer
The downside going school take time also expensive say Sleator
On hand Our student get lot real plum job
I think easy someone coming boot camp program get job Google

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue

In traditionally either kind variable
The latter may allow element mutated length changed may fixed creation
A string generally understood often implemented store sequence element typically character using
A string may also denote general sequence data type structure
Depending programming language precise data type used declared string may either cause storage memory statically allocated predetermined maximum length employ allow hold variable number element
When string appears literally known anonymous string
In used string finite sequence chosen called
Let Σ symbol alternatively called character called
No assumption made nature symbol
A Σ finite symbol Σ
For example Σ string Σ
The string number symbol length sequence often denoted
The unique string Σ length denoted
The set string Σ length denoted Σ
For example Σ Σ
Note Σ ε alphabet Σ
The set string Σ length Σ denoted Σ
In term Σ For example Σ Σ ε
Although set Σ element Σ string finite length
A set string Σ
Σ called Σ
For example Σ set string even number zero ε formal language important Σ
For two string Σ concatenation defined sequence symbol followed sequence character denoted
For example Σ b z
String concatenation operation
The empty string ε serf string ε ε
Therefore set Σ concatenation operation form generated Σ
In addition length function defines Σ integer function
A string said exist possibly empty string
The substring defines Σ empty string
A string said exists string
If nonempty said prefix
Symmetrically string said exists string
If nonempty said suffix
Suffixes prefix substring
Both relation prefix suffix
A string said rotation
For example Σ string rotation u v
The reverse string string symbol reverse order
For example abc b c symbol alphabet reverse cba
A string reverse madam called also includes empty string string length
It often useful define set string
If alphabet Σ cf
one define total order Σ called
For example Σ lexicographical order Σ includes relationship ε
The lexicographical order alphabetical order nontrivial alphabet even alphabetical order
See alternative string ordering preserve
A number additional operation string commonly occur formal theory
These given article
Strings admit following interpretation node graph The natural topology set string string discrete topology natural topology set infinite string viewing set infinite string set finite string
This construction used construction yield topology
string representation topology found normalizing according
A datatype modeled idea formal string
Strings important useful datatype implemented nearly every
In language available others
The programming language allows string usually quoted way represent instance string datatype called
Although formal string arbitrary finite length length string real language often constrained artificial maximum
In general two type string datatypes fixed maximum length determined compile time use amount memory whether maximum needed whose length arbitrarily fixed use varying amount memory depending actual requirement
Most string modern string
Of course even string limited length number bit available pointer size available
The string length stored separate integer may put artificial limit length implicitly termination character usually character value bit zero
See also
String datatypes historically allocated one byte per character although exact character set varied region character encoding similar enough programmer could often get away ignoring since character program treated specially period space comma place encoding program would encounter
These character set typically based
If text one encoding displayed system using different encoding text often though often somewhat readable computer user learned read mangled text
language known collectively need far character limit one byte encoding reasonable representation
The normal solution involved keeping representation ASCII using representation CJK
Use existing code led problem matching cutting string severity depended character encoding designed
Some encoding family guarantee byte value ASCII range represent ASCII character making encoding safe system use character field separator
Other encoding make guarantee making matching byte code unsafe
These encoding also locating character boundary required backing start string pasting two string together could result corruption second string
simplified picture somewhat
Most programming language datatype Unicode string
Unicode preferred byte stream format designed problem described older multibyte encoding
require programmer know code unit different character main difficulty currently incorrectly designed APIs attempt hide difference make character due composing code
Some language like implement string used datatype exception rule
Some language normally allow content string changed created termed string
In language value fixed new string must created alteration made termed string
Strings typically implemented byte character code unit order allow fast access individual unit character fixed length
A language implement instead
Some language avoid implementing dedicated string datatype instead adopting convention representing string list character code
Representations string depend heavily choice character repertoire method character encoding
Older string implementation designed work repertoire encoding defined ASCII recent extension like series
Modern implementation often use extensive repertoire defined Unicode along variety complex encoding
The term usually indicates string byte rather string readable character string bit
Byte string often imply byte take value data stored meaning value interpreted termination value
Most string implementation similar entry storing corresponding character
The principal difference certain encoding single logical character may take one entry array
This happens example single code code point take anywhere one four byte single character take arbitrary number code
In case logical length string number character differs physical length array number byte use
avoids first part problem
The length string stored implicitly using special terminating character often NUL bit zero convention used perpetuated popular
Hence representation commonly referred
This representation string take space terminator thus
In terminated string terminating code allowable character string
Strings field limitation also store arbitrary
An example stored along modern representation The length string example character occupies byte
Characters terminator form part representation may either part data garbage
Strings form sometimes called original directive used declare
Using special byte null terminating string historically appeared hardware software though sometimes value also printing character
used many assembler system used system character value zero used since string delimiter BASIC language
Somewhat similar data processing machine like used special bit delimit string left operation would start right
This bit clear part string
This meant IBM word almost ever thought use feature override assignment seventh bit example handle ASCII code
Early microcomputer software relied upon fact ASCII code use bit set indicate end string
It must reset prior output
The length string also stored explicitly example prefixing string length byte value convention used many dialect consequence people call string
Storing string length byte limit maximum string length
To avoid limitation improved implementation use store string length
When field cover string limited
If length bounded encoded constant space typically machine word thus leading taking space number character word ASCII machine machine etc
If length bounded encoding length take log space see string encoding string length log space
In latter case field fixed length therefore actual string data need moved string grows length field need increased
Here Pascal string stored buffer along ASCII representation Many language including one implement string internal structure like However since implementation usually string must accessed modified member function
pointer dynamically allocated memory area might expanded needed
See also
Both character termination length code limit string For example C character array contain null NUL character handled directly C string library function Strings using length code limited maximum value length code
Both limitation overcome clever programming
It possible create data structure function manipulate problem associated character termination principle overcome length code bound
It also possible optimize string represented using technique replacing repeated character character value length
While representation common others possible
Using make certain string operation insertion deletion concatenation efficient
The core data structure one manages string sequence character represents current state file edited
While state could stored single long consecutive array character typical text editor instead us alternative representation sequence data line make certain string operation insertion deletion undoing previous edits efficient
The differing memory layout storage requirement string affect security program accessing string data
String representation requiring terminating character commonly susceptible problem terminating character present caused coding error deliberately altering data
String representation adopting separate length field also susceptible length manipulated
In case program code accessing string data requires ensure inadvertently access change data outside string memory limit
String data frequently obtained program
As responsibility program validate string ensure represents expected format
Performing limited validation cause program vulnerable attack
Sometimes string need embedded inside text file intended consumption machine
This needed example source code programming language configuration file
In case NUL character work well terminator since normally invisible difficult input via keyboard
Storing string length would also inconvenient manual computation tracking length tedious
Two common representation While character string common us string string computer science may refer generically sequence homogeneously typed data
A example may used represent retrieved communication medium
This data may may represented datatype depending need application desire programmer capability programming language used
If programming language string implementation data corruption may ensue
C programmer draw sharp distinction string aka string character definition always null terminated byte string pseudo string may stored array often null terminated
Using function byte string often seems work later lead
There many processing string various
Some category algorithm include Advanced string algorithm often employ complex mechanism data structure among
The name coined computer scientist issue algorithm data structure used string processing
Character string useful datatype several language designed order make string processing application easy write
Examples include following language Many utility perform simple string manipulation used easily program powerful string processing algorithm
Files finite stream may viewed string
Some like use string hold command interpreted
Recent including Perl Ruby Tcl employ facilitate text operation
Perl particularly noted regular expression use many language application implement
Some language Perl Ruby support permit arbitrary expression evaluated included string literal
used manipulate string change edit content string
They also used query information string
They usually used within context
The basic example string function function function return length string counting terminator character string internal structural information modify string
This function often named
For example would return
In alternative string
It ability altered adding appending whereas String normally fixed
standard way handle text use
Any given Java mean changed
A
Whenever must manipulated change require creation new turn involves creation new array character copying original array
This happens even original value intermediate used manipulation kept
Java provides two alternate class string manipulation called
Both like array hold character
They however mutable state altered
Their array character necessarily completely filled opposed String whose array always exact required length content
Thus capability add remove change state without creating new object without creation new array array copying
The exception array longer suitable length hold content case rarely happens default Dynamic memory allocation provided JVM
In case required create new array copy content
For reason Java would handle expression like like Generally String string handling
However necessarily case since StringBuffer required recreate character array run space
Theoretically possible happen number time new String would required although unlikely programmer provide length hint prevent
Either way effect noticeable modern desktop computer
As well shortcoming array inherent
In order insert remove character arbitrary position whole section array must moved
The method attractive environment low processing power take ability using much memory likely also premium environment
This point however trivial considering space required creating many instance Strings order process
As well StringBuffer optimized waste little memory possible

submitted Hey I currently physic major finishing junior year
I dropped computer science minor class towards I wanted share
After two half year pursuing minor I hit brick wall I could enroll CSE
I missing single requirement CSE CSE
I figured happens I would find way around
WRONG
The CSE department batshit insane seems like actively try make impossible experience
There CSE class I could enroll next quarter I needed graduate time I figured I would contact professor try waive prerequisite
CSE basic intro programming assumes prior programming knowledge I programming year I figured I petition class even offering take final pas
After four separate attempt pas I learned department circumstance ever allows test course something every single department offer
What worse nobody even told policy fourth try
Additionally CSE department Professors CAN NOT allow course petition every single major allows
Its real possibility get stuck unable complete degree forced stay longer pay
I went administration hope might help
By way single hour half window entire week allow
If free hag work refuse meet
I went office one advisor busy fact talked bit thing
I brought unfortunate situation instantly tightened said I would need schedule appointment I wanted ask advice
WHAT THE FUCK
These pencil pushing bureaucrat NOT help help reason unless paperwork tell okay
I scheduled appointment like good little drone head student affair Veronica Abreu
She instead trying help proceeded tell stupid I trying waive prerequisite last year smugly told I drop minor cut loss
I asked alternative minor I might take way I might take upper division class simply blamed poor scheduling told read rule carefully future
Certainly situation I found fault point I trying make I known backwards as rule beginning I might able plan better
If go major try declare minor need understand utterly ignored
Nobody administration side clear disregard mental well student nobody help struggling
To contrast I found physic administration exceedingly helpful major met student advisor Toni extremely hard working go way try help
Damn got really long I even mentioned retarded part department like lottery need win accepted fact professor spend time trying catch cheater actually teach looking Ord
And course
I Excel With Integrity
Post comment
Title relate anything post content lengthy rant I regret reading
Majors minor got priority enroll CS class
And CS class full high demand widely known long time
Honestly problem underfunded enrollment number overworked None even close professor fault especially Ord
Also absolutely necessary course minor start
It still suck though look like pickle due priority enrollment cse major enjoy
Sadly immediate solution problem
Welcome UCSD may reflect department proabably cause smaller reflects SD admin whole
They nothing especially come undergrad
Sorry hear butnot much ive read
feelsbadman Wait fuck
I know people take got
Guess changed recently
Actually
Apparently CSE used waive certain depending situation Like I said since first quarter
Fuck CS department
Also I Excel Integrity
After two half year pursuing minor I hit brick wall I could enroll CSE
I missing single requirement CSE CSE
get CSE year
wait long try take
I assuming CSE requirement minor OP probably planned take closer graduating
This would make sense take account always prereq especially since admits planning probably date prereq update
Yeah full shit OP
The department procedure place handle fact every idiot want cushy webdev job flooded major
You also sound like kind asshole want go way someone even major
I would loved take cool CS class department weird obsession completing
I recommend taking Cogs class instead
BTW nobody going care CS minor
I known many CS minor ca code shit
Find another way prove coding skill like personal project research paper something
Yep CSE department went downhill lot
And counselor know shit CSE working college academic advising CSE
There really one good counselor know lot CSE
While I ca comment reading dept
policy knowing I CAN comment behavior surprising someone else mentioned UCSD admin general
With said I HAVE good encounter sadly seem norm
The university opinion way fragmented nobody know anybody else everyone thing somewhat differently making incredibly frustrating difficult downright detrimental lot student

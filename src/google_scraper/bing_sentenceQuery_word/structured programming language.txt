A used produce various kind
Programming language generally consist
Programming language used create implement specific
The earliest known programmable machine preceded automatic flute player described century
From early program used direct behavior machine
Thousands different programming language created mainly computer field many still created every year
Many programming language require computation specified form sequence operation perform language use form program specification form
desired result specified achieve
The description programming language usually split two component form meaning
Some language defined specification document example programming language specified Standard language dominant treated
Some language basic language defined standard extension taken dominant implementation common
A programming language notation writing specification computation
Some author restrict term programming language language express possible algorithm
Traits often considered important constitutes programming language include like define usually considered programming language
Programming language may however share syntax markup language computational semantics defined
example XML dialect
Moreover mostly used structuring document also contains Turing complete subset
The term sometimes used interchangeably programming language
However usage term varies among author including exact scope
One usage describes programming language subset computer language
In vein language used computing different goal expressing computer program generically designated computer language
For instance markup language sometimes referred computer language emphasize meant used programming
Another usage regard programming language theoretical construct programming abstract machine computer language subset thereof run physical computer finite hardware resource
emphasizes language much programming language language intended execution
He also argues textual even graphical input format affect behavior computer programming language despite fact commonly remark ignorance programming language concept reason many flaw input format
The earliest computer often programmed without help programming language writing program absolute
The program decimal binary form read toggled switch computer
Absolute machine language later termed
The next step development still closely tied specific computer
These served make program much relieved programmer tedious address calculation
The first written
An early programming language designed computer developed German
However implemented
proposed one first language ever developed
Unlike Short Code statement represented mathematical expression understandable form
However program translated every time ran making process much slower running equivalent
At developed early
A used automatically convert language machine code
The first code compiler developed computer University Manchester considered first programming language
The second autocode developed Mark called Mark Autocode
Brooker also developed autocode conjunction University Manchester
The version devised
Known EDSAC Autocode straight development Mercury Autocode adapted local circumstance noted object code optimisation diagnostics advanced time
A contemporary separate thread development developed University Manchester machine
In invented IBM
It first widely used functional implementation opposed design paper
It still popular language used program benchmark rank world
Another early programming language devised US called
It developed period
Hopper found business data processing customer uncomfortable mathematical notation early team wrote specification programming language implemented prototype
The compiler became publicly available early substantially complete
major influence design since direct descendant actual use time
The increased use language introduced requirement
These language varying degree provide facility assembly language language used perform task require direct access hardware facility still provide control structure
The period late brought development major language paradigm use Each language spawned descendant modern programming language count least one ancestry
The also saw considerable debate merit whether programming language designed support
famous letter published argued statement eliminated higher level programming language
The year relative consolidation
combined system programming
The United States government standardized system programming language derived intended use defense contractor
In Japan elsewhere vast sum spent investigating incorporated logic programming construct
The functional language community moved standardize Lisp
Rather inventing new paradigm movement elaborated upon idea invented previous decade
One important trend language design programming system increased focus use organizational unit code
Ada ML developed notable module system often wedded construct
The rapid growth created opportunity new language
originally Unix scripting tool first released became common dynamic
came used programming bytecode virtual machine became popular commercial setting promise popular time early
These development fundamentally novel rather refinement many existing language paradigm although syntax often based C family programming language
Programming language evolution continues industry research
Current direction include security reliability verification new kind modularity database integration Microsoft
computer programming language aim provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware detail
programming language based solving problem using constraint given program rather using written programmer
All programming language building block description data process transformation applied like addition two number selection item collection
These primitive defined syntactic semantic rule describe structure meaning respectively
A programming language surface form known
Most programming language purely textual use sequence text including word number punctuation much like written natural language
On hand programming language nature using visual relationship symbol specify program
The syntax language describes possible combination symbol form syntactically correct program
The meaning given combination symbol handled semantics either
Since language textual article discus textual syntax
Programming language syntax usually defined using combination structure structure
Below simple grammar based This grammar specifies following The following example token sequence grammar
Not syntactically correct program semantically correct
Many syntactically correct program nonetheless per language rule may depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution
In case program may exhibit
Even program within language may still meaning intended person wrote
Using example may possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may false The following fragment syntactically correct performs operation semantically defined operation meaning value complex type defined value If first line omitted program would trigger error compilation variable p would defined
But program would still syntactically correct since type declaration provide semantic information
The grammar needed specify programming language classified position
The syntax programming language specified using grammar
Some language including Perl Lisp contain construct allow execution parsing phase
Languages construct allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis generally blur distinction parsing execution
In contrast Perl block may contain general computation C macro merely string replacement require code execution
The term refers meaning language opposed form
The static semantics defines restriction structure valid text hard impossible express standard syntactic formalism
For compiled language static semantics essentially include semantic rule checked compile time
Examples include checking every declared used language require declaration label arm distinct
Many important restriction type like checking identifier used appropriate context
adding integer function name call appropriate number type argument enforced defining rule called
Other form like may also part static semantics
Newer programming language like form data flow analysis part static semantics
Once data specified machine must instructed perform operation data
For example semantics may define expression evaluated value manner conditionally execute
The also known language defines various construct language produce program behavior
There many way defining execution semantics
Natural language often used specify execution semantics language commonly used practice
A significant amount academic research went allow execution semantics specified formal manner
Results field research seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia
A type system defines programming language classifies value expression manipulate type interact
The goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness program written language detecting certain incorrect operation
Any type system involves reject many incorrect program also prohibit correct albeit unusual program
In order bypass downside number language usually unchecked may used programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation different type
In typed language type system used program number language usually functional one relieving programmer need write type annotation
The formal design study type system known
A language specification every operation defines type data operation applicable implication applicable type
For example data represented many programming language dividing number string meaning rejected compiler
The invalid operation may detected program compiled static type checking rejected compiler compilation error message may detected program run dynamic type checking resulting
Many language allow function called exception handler written handle exception example always return result
A special case typed language language
These often scripting markup language one data commonly character string used symbolic numeric data
In contrast allows operation performed data generally considered sequence bit various length
language untyped include variety
In practice language considered typed point view verifying rejecting operation modern language offer degree typing
Many production language provide mean bypass subvert type system trading finer control program execution see
In expression type determined prior program executed typically
For example integer expression passed function expects string stored variable defined hold date
Statically typed language either
In first case programmer must explicitly write type certain textual position example variable
In second case compiler type expression declaration based context
Most mainstream statically typed language manifestly typed
Complete type inference traditionally associated le mainstream language
However many manifestly typed language support partial type inference example infer type certain limited case
Additionally programming language allow type automatically converted type example int used program expects float
also called determines operation run time word type associated rather
As language dynamically typed language require programmer write explicit type annotation expression
Among thing may permit single variable refer value different type different point program execution
However type automatically detected piece code actually executed potentially making difficult
example dynamically typed language
allows value one type treated another example treating number
This occasionally useful also allow kind program fault go undetected even
prevents
An attempt perform operation wrong type value raise error
Strongly typed language often termed
An alternative definition weakly typed refers language permit large number implicit type conversion
In JavaScript example expression implicitly convert number conversion succeeds even string letter
Such implicit conversion often useful mask programming error
generally considered orthogonal concept usage literature differs
Some use term mean even confusingly mean simply
Thus called strongly typed weakly statically typed
It may seem odd professional programmer C could weakly statically typed
However notice use generic pointer pointer allow casting pointer pointer without needing explicit cast
This extremely similar somehow casting array byte kind datatype C without using explicit cast
Most programming language associated core sometimes known library especially included part published language standard conventionally made available implementation language
Core library typically include definition commonly used algorithm data structure mechanism input output
The line language core library differs language language
In case language designer may treat library separate entity language
However language core library often treated part language user language specification even require library made available implementation
Indeed language designed meaning certain syntactic construct even described without referring core library
For example string literal defined instance class similarly expression block construct instance library class
Conversely contains multiple coherent subset suffice construct rest language library macro language designer even bother say portion language must implemented language construct must implemented part library
Programming language share property natural language related purpose vehicle communication syntactic form separate semantics showing related language branching one another
But artificial construct also differ fundamental way language evolved usage
A significant difference programming language fully described studied entirety since precise finite definition
By contrast natural language changing meaning given user different community
While also artificial language designed ground specific purpose lack precise complete semantic definition programming language
Many programming language designed scratch altered meet new need combined language
Many eventually fallen disuse
Although attempt design one universal programming language serf purpose failed generally accepted filling role
The need diverse programming language arises diversity context language used One common trend development programming language add ability solve problem using higher level
The earliest programming language tied closely underlying hardware computer
As new programming language developed feature added let programmer express idea remote simple translation underlying hardware instruction
Because programmer le tied complexity computer program computing le effort programmer
This let write functionality per time unit
proposed way eliminate need specialized language programming
However goal remains distant benefit open debate
took position use formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless construct dismissed foolish
similarly dismissive idea
Hybrid approach taken
A language designer user must construct number artifact govern enable practice programming
The important artifact language
The specification programming language artifact language use agree upon whether piece valid language behavior shall
A programming language specification take several form including following An programming language provides way write program language execute one configuration hardware software
There broadly two approach programming language implementation
It generally possible implement language using either technique
The output may executed hardware program called interpreter
In implementation make use interpreter approach distinct boundary compiling interpreting
For instance implementation compile execute source line time
Programs executed directly hardware usually run several order magnitude faster interpreted software
One technique improving performance interpreted program
Here execution translates block going used machine code direct execution hardware
Although commonly used programming language fully open specification implementation many programming language exist proprietary programming language implementation available single vendor may claim proprietary language intellectual property
Proprietary programming language commonly internal single product proprietary language used internally within vendor others available external user
Some programming language exist border proprietary open example asserts proprietary right aspect programming language open implementation part system also CLR closed environment
Many proprietary language widely used spite proprietary nature example include
Some language may make transition closed open example originally Ericsson internal programming language
Thousands different programming language created mainly computing field
Software commonly built programming language
Programming language differ form human expression require greater degree precision completeness
When using natural language communicate people human author speaker ambiguous make small error still expect intent understood
However figuratively speaking computer exactly told understand code programmer intended write
The combination language definition program program input must fully specify external behavior occurs program executed within domain control program
On hand idea algorithm communicated human without precision required execution using interleaf natural language code written programming language
A programming language provides structured mechanism defining piece data operation transformation may carried automatically data
A us present language represent concept involved computation
These concept represented collection simplest element available called
process programmer combine primitive compose new program adapt existing one new us changing environment
Programs computer might without human interaction user might type
In case command simply program whose execution chained together
When language run command interpreter without compiling called
It difficult determine programming language widely used usage mean varies context
One language may occupy greater number programmer hour different one line code third may consume CPU time
Some language popular particular kind application
For example still strong corporate data center often large scientific engineering application aerospace transportation military embedded application embedded application operating system
Other language regularly used write many different kind application
Various method measuring language popularity subject different bias measured proposed Combining averaging information various internet site claim ten popular programming language descending order overall popularity
There overarching classification scheme programming language
A given programming language usually single ancestor language
Languages commonly arise combining element several predecessor language new idea circulation time
Ideas originate one language diffuse throughout family related language leap suddenly across familial gap appear entirely different family
The task complicated fact language classified along multiple ax
For example Java language encourages organization concurrent language contains construct running multiple parallel

In broad stroke programming language divide classification distinguished
Traditionally programming language regarded describing computation term imperative sentence
issuing command
These generally called language
A great deal research programming language aimed blurring distinction program set instruction program assertion desired answer main feature
More refined paradigm include language hybrid paradigm
An much paradigm direct model underlying machine architecture
By purpose programming language might considered general purpose scripting language language language combination
Some general purpose language designed largely educational goal
A programming language may also classified factor unrelated programming paradigm
For instance programming language use keywords
Other language may classified

aimed improving clarity quality development time making extensive use contrast using simple test jump statement could lead difficult follow maintain
It emerged late appearance programming language latter including support block structure
Contributing factor popularity widespread acceptance first academia later among practitioner include discovery known publication influential open letter Dutch computer scientist coined term structured programming
Structured programming frequently used deviation allow clearer program particular case performed
Following program seen composed callable unit procedure function method subprogram used allow sequence referred single statement
used enable group statement treated one statement
language syntax enclosing structure formal way bracketed code section bracketed indentation curly brace
It possible structured programming programming language though preferable use something like
Some language initially used structured programming include new procedural programming language since time included feature encourage structured programming sometimes deliberately left feature notably GOTO effort make difficult
sometimes known modular programming enforces logical structure program written make efficient easier understand modify
The provides theoretical basis structured programming
It state three way combining selection sufficient express
This observation originate structured programming movement structure sufficient describe well operation
Therefore processor always executing structured program sense even instruction read memory part structured program
However author usually credit result paper Böhm Jacopini possibly cited paper
The structured program theorem address write analyze usefully structured program
These issue addressed late early major contribution
structured programming described reaction structured program theorem accepted principle program must written provability mind disagreed still disagrees abolishing GOTO statement
In paper Structured Programming Goto Statements gave example believed direct jump lead clearer efficient code without sacrificing provability
Knuth proposed looser structural constraint It possible draw program forward branch left backward branch right branch crossing
Many knowledgeable advocated allowing
Structured programming theorist gained major ally researcher applied interpretation structured programming theory development indexing system research file
The project great engineering success manager company cited support adopting structured programming although Dijkstra criticized way Mills interpretation differed published work
As late still possible raise question structured programming computer science journal
Frank Rubin year open letter titled GOTO considered harmful considered harmful
Numerous objection followed including response Dijkstra sharply criticized Rubin concession writer made responding
By end century nearly computer scientist convinced useful learn apply concept structured programming
programming language originally lacked programming structure
While goto largely replaced structured construct selection repetition language purely structured
The common deviation found many language use early exit subroutine
This result multiple exit point instead single exit point required structured programming
There construction handle case awkward purely structured programming
The common deviation structured programming early exit function loop
At level function statement
At level loop statement terminate loop statement terminate current iteration proceed next iteration
In structured programming replicated adding additional branch test return nested code add significant complexity
early prominent example construct
Some newer language also labeled break allow breaking innermost loop
Exceptions also allow early exit consequence thus treated
Multiple exit arise variety reason often either subroutine work returning value completed calculation encountered exceptional circumstance prevent continuing hence needing exception handling
The common problem early exit cleanup final statement executed example allocated memory deallocated open file closed causing
These must done return site brittle easily result bug
For instance later development return statement could overlooked developer action performed end subroutine statement might performed case
Languages without return statement standard problem
Most modern language provide support prevent leak see detailed discussion
Most commonly done via unwind protection ensures certain code guaranteed run execution exit block structured alternative cleanup block
This often known considered part
Various technique exist encapsulate resource management
An alternative approach found primarily us normal stack unwinding variable deallocation function exit call destructors local variable deallocate resource
argued book nested conditionals may harder understand certain type flatter structure using multiple exit predicated
Their book flatly state one exit point really useful rule
Clarity key principle If method clearer one exit point use one exit point otherwise
They offer cookbook solution transforming function consisting nested conditionals sequence guarded return throw statement followed single unguarded block intended contain code common case guarded statement supposed deal le common one error
also argue tip book point obsolete requirement
In textbook writes control flow often desirable
Using Tennent framework notion Watt uniformly describes control flow construct found contemporary programming language attempt explain certain type sequencer preferable others context control flow
Watt writes unrestricted gotos jump sequencer bad destination jump reader program reader find examines actual label address target jump
In contrast Watt argues conceptual intent return sequencer clear context without examine destination
Watt writes class sequencer known defined sequencer terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses break loop including break return statement
Watt also note jump sequencer gotos somewhat restricted language like C target must inside local block encompassing outer block restriction alone sufficient make intent gotos C still produce
Watt also examines exception sequencer differ escape jump sequencer explained next section article
In contrast wrote textbook instruction like old sheep clothing strongly advised use
Based coding error software developer Jim Bonang argues exception thrown function violate paradigm proposes exception forbidden
In syntax done declaring function signature since
Bonang proposes conforming written along line Peter Ritchie also note principle even single right function constitutes violation principle argues Dijkstra rule written time exception handling became paradigm programming language proposes allow number throw point addition single return point
He note solution wrap exception sake creating higher nesting depth thus difficult comprehend even accuses propose apply solution programming language support exception engaging thinking
David Watt also analyzes exception handling framework sequencer introduced article previous section early exit
Watt note abnormal situation generally exemplified arithmetic overflow failure like file found kind error detected program unit handler naturally located program unit
For example program might contain several call read file action perform file found depends meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine abnormal situation located system code
Watts note introducing status flag testing caller structured programming even return sequencer would entail result situation application code tends get cluttered test status flag programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag
In fact abnormal situation represented status flag default ignored
He note contrast status flag testing exception opposite causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deal exception way possibly adding code willfully ignore
Based argument Watt concludes jump sequencer escape sequencer discussed previous section suitable dedicated exception sequencer semantics discussed
The textbook Louden Lambert emphasizes exception handling differs structured programming construct like loop transfer control set different point program actual transfer take place
At point transfer actually occurs may syntactic indication control fact transferred
Computer science professor Arvind Kumar Bansal also note language implement exception handling even control structure like property absence exception longer presence exception exception prematurely cause early exit part control structure instance throw exception usual exit point check reached
Citing multiple prior study others result Westley Weimer wrote significant problem exception create hidden path difficult programmer reason
The necessity limit code point appears contemporary programming environment focused parallel computing
The various parallel construct OpenMP like allow early exit inside outside parallel construct restriction includes manner exit exception permitted inside parallel construct jump target also inside
More rarely subprogram allow multiple This commonly subprogram yield control possibly value resumed left
There number programming notably particularly state machine concurrency
From code execution point view yielding coroutine closer structured programming returning subroutine subprogram actually terminated continue called early exit
However coroutines mean multiple subprogram execution state rather single call stack subroutine thus introduce different form complexity
It rare subprogram allow entry arbitrary position subprogram case program state variable value uninitialized ambiguous similar goto
Some program particularly number follow way easily reduced basic structure programmer implement jump new state
This type often used Linux kernel
However possible structure system making separate subprogram using variable indicate active state see
Alternatively implemented via coroutines dispense trampoline

Structured programming logical programming method considered precursor programming OOP
Structured programming facilitates program understanding modification design approach system divided compositional subsystem
Structured programming procedural programming subset reduces need goto statement
In many way OOP considered type structured programming deploys structured programming technique
Certain language like Pascal Algorithmic Language ALGOL Ada designed enforce structured programming
The structured programming concept formalized Corrado Böhm Giuseppe Jacopini demonstrated theoretical computer program design loop sequence decision
In late Edsger developed structural programming functionality widely used method program divided multiple section multiple exit one access point
Modular programming another example structural programming program divided interactive module

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

suggested antidote unstructured programming existed decade Structured programming invented
An unstructured program procedural program statement executed sequence written
But type programming us goto statement
A goto statement allows control passed place program
When goto statement executed sequence continues target goto
Thus understand program work pretend execute
This mean often difficult understand logic program
Some program compiler goto connects making practical rapidly navigate source code
However common practice programming language use variable association goto go making automated indexing impractical
There similar problem structured programming language foreign language view implemented permit many people view computer data human language
This contrast idea using form abstraction understand program work structured programming
For reason suggested Dijkstra goto statement banned
In one view avoids using dangerous goto statement
This prevents potentially confusing transfer control
Many structured programming language support goto statement used structured manner
For example exit end routine return beginning loop
In another view structured programming confines using control structure one entry point one exit point
The important structure sequence selection repetition
Yet another view structured program program written way understood easily using abstraction
Abstraction mean able understand overall purpose code without understanding detail
A prime mechanism abstraction procedure method
But structure also help using abstraction
Structured programming made possible language package related program could flow charted software diagramming technique understandable

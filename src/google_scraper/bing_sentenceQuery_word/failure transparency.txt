An said referentially transparent corresponding value without changing program behavior
As result referentially transparent function give argument
Such function called
An expression referentially transparent called referentially opaque
In function application referentially definition constitutes
However always case programming term used avoid misleading connotation
In referentially transparent function considered
Some provide mean guarantee referential transparency
Some functional programming language enforce referential transparency function
The importance referential transparency allows reason program behavior
This help proving simplifying assisting modifying code without breaking code mean
As referential transparency requires result given set input point time referentially transparent expression therefore
The concept although term seems originated
It adopted A mode containment φ referentially transparent whenever occurrence singular term purely referential term sentence ψ purely referential also containing term sentence φ ψ
The term appeared contemporary usage discussion seminal set lecture note
The lecture note referenced Quine bibliography
If function involved expression expression referentially transparent
Also impure function included expression value discarded insignificant
Consider function return input source
In pseudocode call function might might identify particular disk file etc
Even identical value successive return value different
Therefore function neither deterministic referentially transparent
A subtle example function depends input explicitly passed parameter
This resolved according rule variable current execution environment variable static binding
Since variable altered without changing value passed parameter result subsequent call function may differ even parameter identical
However pure allowed thus free variable value function still referentially transparent neither variable value change due static binding immutability respectively
Arithmetic operation referentially transparent replaced instance
In fact function mathematical sense referentially transparent transparent since always give result particular
Assignments transparent
For instance expression change value assigned variable
Assuming initially value two consecutive evaluation expression yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
However calling function transparent implicitly change input x thus
transparent evaluate replace value say Jan get result run tomorrow
This depends state date
In language like substitute equal equal every value x
This hold language
If substitution expression value valid certain point execution program expression referentially transparent
The definition ordering theoretical foundation part semantics imperative programming language
However referentially transparent expression evaluated time necessary define sequence point guarantee order evaluation
Programming done without consideration called
One advantage writing code referentially transparent style given intelligent compiler easier better possible automatically
For example programming C performance penalty including call expensive function inside loop even function call could moved outside loop without changing result program
The programmer would forced perform manual call possibly expense source code readability
However compiler able determine function call referentially transparent perform transformation automatically
The primary disadvantage language enforce referential transparency make expression operation naturally fit imperative programming style awkward le concise
Such language often incorporate mechanism make task easier retaining purely functional quality language
As example let use two function one referentially opaque referentially transparent The function referentially transparent mean
For instance
However ca say thing us global variable modifies
The referential opacity make reasoning program difficult
For example say wish reason following statement One may tempted simplify statement However work occurrence evaluates different value
Remember return value based global value passed get modified call
This mean mathematical identity longer hold
Such mathematical identity hold referentially transparent function
However sophisticated analysis used simplify statement This take step requires degree insight code infeasible compiler optimization
Therefore referential transparency allows u reason code lead robust program possibility finding bug could hope find testing possibility seeing opportunity

Can anyone explain simple word transparency Distributed Systems
I ca understand actually practice
Here I found Transparency The distributed system perceived single entity user application programmer rather collection autonomous system cooperating
The user unaware service located also transferring local machine remote one also transparent
Why system perceived single entity user
What reason
Also please give realistic example answer
The implication transparency major influence design system software
simple word defined concealment user application programmer separation component distributed system system perceived whole rather collection independent component
enables local remote resource accessed using identical operation
enables resource accessed without knowledge physical network location example building IP address
enables concealment fault allowing user application program complete task despite failure hardware software component enables several process operate concurrently using shared resource without interference
To give realistic example imagine website get hacked homepage appears hacked wait till fix problem
You would want perceive user system updated hide fact system weak hacked
You would want act whole rather collection independent component transparency
By posting answer agree

The purpose shield change system human user end interface
Confusingly term refers overall component refer
The term widely used computing marketing substitution term since term bad usually seen something user ca see control term good connotation usually associated hiding anything
The vast majority time term used misleading way refer actual invisibility computing process
Because misleading definition modern computer literature tends prefer use agnostic transparent
The term used particularly often regard invisible either upper lower neighbouring layer
Also temporarily used later around IBM Honeywell programming manual term referred certain technique
An application code transparent clear detail management contained logic solving main problem
It achieved putting code module internal detail making invisible main application
For example transparent introduces access file stored remotely network way uniform previous local access user might even notice using folder hierarchy
The early FTP considerably le transparent requires user learn access file client
Similarly file system allow transparent decompression data enabling user store file medium without special knowledge file system encrypt file transparently
This approach require running compression encryption utility manually
In also considered good practice develop use abstraction layer access application work different database abstraction layer allows part program access database transparently see example
In transparency facilitated use hide actual implementation done different underlying

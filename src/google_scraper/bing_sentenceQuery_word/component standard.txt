Sadly turn increasingly poor match marketplace
Consider employer big stack clearly specified problem solved
That stack problem ideal handing programmer country side globe
Top graduate standard Computer Science undergraduate program go graduate school Computer Science ultimately become professor Computer Science
In word academic fine job replicating
But majority graduate looking job software engineer focus article best prepare people job
Graduates done much group work
Universities spend billion facility student sleep together facility student work together
We society least judge prescription written pediatric psychiatrist suffering epidemic Attention Deficit Disorder
We student watched MTV cradle
Yet structure learning student take homework back dorm room try work problem fighting distraction dormmates unrelated major TV DVDs video game instant message email Web
Students come university excellent study habit still get excellent education
Students managed hop low hurdle junior high high school despite poor study habit may get minimal benefit college
Graduates good taking vague goal person turning concrete specification implemented within fixed budget time resource
Graduates good communicating writing presentation asking question user customer
Lack experience user interface design testing experience handling real user suggestion complaint
Lack professionalism graduate dedicated completing something value
Students learn feel good solve problem get something usually good grade
Students learn value generated first accomplishes task new information system
Consequently CS graduate happy draw salary building system percent finished never installed used
Lack focus big picture graduate ca understand work relates larger organizational goal
Graduates experienced quickly making sense large commercial tool library writing small piece code control extend library
The result tendency start scratch rewrite code fully understood rather reuse
Many early Web application plagued bug database management system written computer science graduate interested writing C code learning apply standard relational database management system
The news article correct complete
While true employment software development shrunk hundred thousand people fired also true hundred thousand people hired
The newspaper correct number people hired smaller number fired
The question journalist asked Who getting fired
For nimble employer first people get pink slip older programmer whose performance average whose salary benefit cost high
Who getting hired
New college graduate thanks youth high energy level low employment cost
Among desirable young relatively cheap worker one get hired first whose education match current employer need
For foreseeable future every young person graduating Computer Science get job United States owe career firing older worker
It cruel marketplace task document improve computer science education help young people reduce cruelty American employment market
Thus goal computer science bachelor program ought give young energetic person project group work experience best older programmer
Second want graduate satisfying career autonomy responsibility job security
Consider typical computer programmer take specification subsystem manager unthinkingly produce program meet spec hand resulting code back testing integration evaluation department
This really factory job hand get dirty
What wrong
Sociologists tracked substantial loss worker satisfaction craft job replaced factory job
A craftsman build complete product delivers directly hand customer seeing hearing satisfaction new product delivered
A factory worker contrast build small component product typically several distribution layer removed customer
A craftsman responsible whether product go door customer
In classical factory totally separate part bureaucracy quality control department decides whether product shipped
A craftsman listens customer need adapts resulting product accordingly
Factory worker never talk customer separate marketing department ass customer need determines change product design
Not job code factory satisfying neither secure
There abstraction barrier manager programmer spec code
One thing student learn computer science undergraduate virtue abstraction barrier
You replace Module A expensive programmer Module B cheap programmer another country never notice long Modules A B present interface outside world email spec source code
What actual skill graduate need order get job
To get satisfying job
To keep job face pressure younger cheaper worker
A professional programmer ought able pick worthwhile problem attack
Engineering art building solution problem society regard significant
A person blindly told without independently figuring context significance problem engineering
A professional programmer need able sit meeting decision maker prepared substantial domain knowledge make significant contribution discussion
A professional programmer need skilled design
Our student able study week per year perhaps four quarter finish bachelor degree calendar month
Most university operate respect copy Ivy League school
In many way make sense copy leader Harvard Yale calendar one
Top university United States session week
It make sense customer wealthy family
There need long summer break kid free join family yacht Mediterranean
And need long winter break kid come beach house Caribbean
And fun spring skiing Aspen Biff Muffy ca take week school
Computer science however commonly chosen major child American aristocracy
For middle class parent traditional university calendar mean pay tuition also pay spring break trip South Padre Island world summer job scarce support kid long summer winter break
Why Johnny school basis graduate family payroll age
Students graduate portfolio work credential show employer
Nearly programmer think average talent achievement
Precious concrete evidence support belief
The curriculum need include enough project time producing good presentation every student graduate portfolio showing problem attacked design produced extent complete solution implemented
The curriculum also provide opportunity achieving recognized national certification
As date writing common certification standard Cisco Microsoft Oracle closely tied company product taste
Unless consortium university employer develops competing set standard probably worth helping student meet currently recognized standard
Grade inflation rampant good school transcript longer meaningful
Students graded exclusively outsider
In case computer scanning result Microsoft certification test
In case external client student team built project
In case might professional engineer academic foreign country applying written standard
But case teacher whose salary paid student tuition
The potential conflict interest therefore grade inflation high furthermore want faculty regarded coach rather evaluator
All student work character engineering project client talk problem student team prepares written plan solving problem student team discus plan client student team build prototype student team test prototype client user student team refines prototype response testing student team document result
Everything standard engineering curriculum taught process
For example student building flight simulation game might need refer Physics textbook practice Physics problem order learn enough build prototype
This make bit tough faculty need clever enough weave course Physics Calculus Biology engineering project
The payoff time student graduate completely comfortable engineering process listen design discus implement test refine write
Weaving subject literature history curriculum present challenge left exercise reader

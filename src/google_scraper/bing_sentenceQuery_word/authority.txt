knowledge area someone authority subject society higher spiritual power
When word used name organization name usually refers governing body upon authority vested example
It also mean right something execute order
In term often used interchangeably
However meaning differ defined ability influence somebody something would done refers claim justification right exercise power
For example power punish criminal example people believe consider law authority punish criminal legally law say
There several contribution debate
Among others provided remarkable text
In jurisdiction political authority location balancing freedom authority cf
Cristi requirement political obligation core question present
Most society engaged ongoing discussion regarding legitimate extent exercise authority
In instance apparent prevailing belief political system instituted accord populace much freedom reasonable government
In discussion regarding legitimacy political authority end spectrum view could described either belief absolute freedom individual
belief must central authority form sovereign claim ownership control mass

The argument political anarchy made PhD book
In book delf various justification used political theorist throughout history justify legitimacy political authority via State
On hand one main argument legitimacy state made book
Since emergence authority become subject research variety setting family parental authority small group informal authority intermediate organization school church army industry bureaucracy organizational bureaucratic authority inclusive organization ranging primitive tribal society modern intermediate organization political authority
The definition authority contemporary social science remains matter debate
According Michaels authority capacity innate acquired exercising ascendancy group
Other scientist argue
It power sanctioned institutionalized
hint parallel authority
sociological philosophical work identified distinguished three type legitimate domination German generally mean sometimes rendered English translation type authority seen political concept first place
Weber defined domination authority chance command obeyed specifiable group people
Legitimate authority recognized legitimate justified ruler ruled
Weber divided legitimate authority three type History witnessed several system traditional authority usually started Charismatic authority
Weber state distinguishes authority one hand leadership hand legitimacy
Superiors state feel right issue command subordinate perceive obligation obey
Social scientist agree authority one several resource available incumbent formal position
For example Head State dependent upon similar nesting authority
His legitimacy must acknowledged citizen control valued resource immediate staff cabinet military leader long run administration political apparatus entire society
Authority created either expressly implication public entity act publicly using mean communicate grant authority agent use communicate third party apparent authority describes situation principal placed restriction agent known third party restriction government agent accomplished open law regulation everyone including contractor supposed know law regulation government thus concept apparent authority often inapt dealing government insofar cognizable restriction agent authority deemed known third party shattering appearance authority

First published June By end century professional consolidation science brought prestige nascent scientific community also exclusion amateur activity scientific enterprise
In line development popular culture sport entertainment role public reduced spectator
Science best done scientist another commodity consumer revolution received participated
No longer citizen Republic Science lay public left trust scientist indeed posse heroic quality portrayed courage patience perseverance selflessness humility
One put one faith science submit rise expert
Such submission authority science demanded faith trust even fatalism called upon traditional authority religion maybe science religion true opiate people
In many respect science mean modern century science would inextricably entangled hope fear modernity see science world
We live extraordinary time
The world around u seems chaotic contradictory secularisation religious fundamentalism technological fantasy reality globalisation fragmentation conflicting tribal loyalty
As science cultural status never privileged open challenge
What I want examine nature challenge I want picking theme lay exclusion
More particularly I shall drawing parallel challenge authority Catholic Church similar time dissent instability
If one lesson History History lesson I say certainly intended either prescriptive proscriptive
If account follows time seems unsettling must accept radical change whether old new indeed uncomfortable process experience
There period history autonomous
We always able search origin ass outcome pick precursor trace influence
Nevertheless part historian craft arrange might otherwise incomprehensible flow complex interaction suitably sized chunk
One chunk find favour historian The Renaissance though might well limit historiographical consensus
The nature timing Renaissance much disputed indeed singularity whether talk Renaissance since period witnessed similar flourishing idea activity
However I believe term commonly understood merit helping mark major transformation European ultimately world history
There I said period history one expect clear cut start finish point
However two convenient moment suggest printing Gutenberg Bible publication Copernicus De Revolutionibus
This may little late taste missing work men Brunelleschi Alberti little early others leaving important work scientific revolution I believe might lack detail made convenience accept permeability historical period feel qualm making reference earlier later event people
Dates period guide gaoler
The importance period seems quite clear
The disintegration mediaeval society brought major dislocation readjustment European worldview social relation international relation politics religion economics demography intellectual life art
According
Rabb ubiquity simultaneity radical departure stamp decade around fundamental dividing point European
The sixteenth century say Rabb time anguish disarray bewilderment sense disorder incoherence mixed doubt misgiving insecurity succession event disruptive safe comfortable supposition occurred hundred The effect radical change dominated Europe next century half crisis resolution middle third seventeenth century
What distinguished earlier period extent rapidity radical change
In large part may ascribed advent printing
There number obvious advantage new technology
It reduced time cost reproduction increased number copy removed possibility copying error though course reproducing error original text
Indeed often effort establish correct text gave rise many theological political discussion new technology discussion could take mere local significance
For example previous challenge church authority John Wycliffe Jan Hus rely oral handwritten dissemination influence largely confined region
Luther however power printed word impact challenge shook whole continent
More later
It much overused term would much say coming print really bring cultural revolution
It could even argued say Peter Rietbergen beginning important cultural revolution western man experienced many thousand year
Religious publication dominated new trade hardly aspect life left untouched manual guide published covering almost everything dress convention etiquette architecture horsemanship
The result increasing uniformity taste culture
Similarly hand state print instrumental bringing greater centralisation standardisation
For example helping establish single national language France
In hand Church printing became effective medium spreading dogma doctrine though doctrine would naturally depend church
The Catholic Church seized power press campaign spread Turkish power Balkans side confessional divide Luther declared print best God invention
Within three year nailing thesis door church Wittenberg copy work market
Like genie bottle power print something could contained controlled least easily showed favouritism loyalty wield power
True gave power already power control Church State also gave voice would otherwise unheard
For attempt censorship many subversive clandestine press would still operate
For every broadsheet support Pope would scatalogical print attacking
The new technology technology information communication reproduction brought new democratisation word image
Indeed among circle generated new fear new spectre educated commoner
Undermining monopoly knowledge spawning new diverse authority might printed word undermine base authority
Might common people say Rietbergen voicing concern contemporary intellectual politician given chance acquire new idea test opinion present position come voice criticism
Such democracy renaissance ideal
It nineteenth century democracy would seen anything rule mob
Nevertheless cultivation individuality something educated elite strive
As Burckhardt pointed long ago singular man unique man highest level individual development highest level praise
We see humanist concern individual equally autobiographical effort Cellini well naked Machiavelli Prince
The ideal l uomo universale nowadays would simply call renaissance man generally studium humanitatis generated deepening interest made man civilised
Braudel written The intellectual ferment Renaissance reformation far raised principle individual interpretation revealed truth laid base freedom conscience
Renaissance humanism preached respect greatness human individual stressed personal intelligence Indeed modern conception mean individual seen stemming period complex interrelationship renaissance reformation birth capitalism
The mediaeval idea individual simply particular member group particular instance generality
The modern idea Raymond Williams written brought change emphasis enabled u think individual kind absolute without immediate group Renaissance humanism may fostered individualism also reconciled least attempted reconcile new individualism older largely mediaeval sense order
Thus great challenge Reformation secular individualism rather challenge individual faith
Reviving Pauline metaphor Christian soldier armed Bible prayer wish Erasmus humblest woman might read Gospels Epistles St countryman might sing part plough weaver chant loom traveller lighten weariness For Erasmus Thomas à Kempis Imitation Christ true veneration saint best achieved imitation inner spiritual development outward ritualistic show
This emphasis subjective religious experience common feature Devotio Moderna highlight personal quality new religious idea
As Williams pointed A change conception relationship crudely recorded new sense individual Truth particular spiritual truth found one reading Bible papal proclamation
Likewise priesthood believer meant individual direct access God unmediated pope priest
For Luther abhorred economic individualism age Church recognised consisting Clergy Laity
It pure invention Luther wrote pope bishop priest monk called spiritual estate prince lord artisan farmer called temporal Christians truly spiritual estate difference among except In Address Christian Nobility German Nation make quite clear baptism gospel faith alone make u spiritual Christian people
The pope bishop may anoint ordain consecrate never make man Christian spiritual man
Luther justification faith attack power Catholic Church rejection spiritual authority
I wish free
I wish become slave authority whether council power University Pope
For I shall proclaim confidence I believe true whether advanced Catholic heretic whether authorised I care Luther early anarchic individualism however generate freedom tolerance one might hope expect
In breaking papal authority say Chadwick Reformation seemed left authority Christian ministry vague uncertain
The answer Luther particularly Calvin organisation new equally authoritarian church Calvin case organised church even stricter one replaced
The burning Michael Servetus Geneva useful corrective simplistic elision Protestantism freedom tolerance progress new therefore modern sensibility good
The said examine supposed parallel new idea religion new idea science
The relationship Protestantism rise modern science long debated John Brooke rightly suggests caution attempt link two
In insightful historical analysis science religion draw complexity relationship avoids neat conclusion
It must supposed writes desire Protestants dissociate Catholic Christianity automatically created disposition favour free The complexity nowhere evident reception Copernican cosmology
Doctrinal difference readily translate philosophical difference whether accept new astronomy
Catholics like Diego de Zuniga readily adopted Copernican system Protestants like Kepler
The Catholic Church may decreed new system erroneous faith equally many Protestants objected absurd rejection common sense
However even without historical convenience able set new old science religion nevertheless see Copernican system fundamental revisioning world understandably come stand archetypal case revolution thought
Not landmark bifurcation science common sense also marked major shift understanding place nature
In Margaret Wertheim opinion quite literally offered new perspective world
The western mind say trained development perspective painting think space Euclidean term
The application geometry enabled artist create illusion seeing three dimension portraying character physical rather metaphysical space
The task facing Copernicus like facing artistic contemporary find best place view harmony symmetry cosmos
In viewing cosmos sun say Wertheim ultimate perspective picture The sense intellectual vertigo experienced many coming term Copernican system result considering Earth motion
I suspect may displacement point view
It every respect dislocation disturbing shift locus
The universe say Koestler reassuringly orderly
It contained centralised natural
In contrast Copernican system opened possibility infinite space plurality world decentralised perplexing anarchic
In Copernican cosmos longer absolute direction space
The universe lost core
It longer heart thousand It unsettling new world Copernicus opened
In mapping heaven gave u new way understanding
It demanded reconsider literal sense place scheme thing
That place however world without absolute without fixed point reference forever motion
It seen world contemporary would view bewilderment
The pluralism relativism invited Copernican system would done little increased feeling security amidst widespread sense disorder incoherence instability concomitant disintegration mediaeval social order emergence modern one
However experience disruption dislocation challenge authority pluralism relativism loss absolute I would argue unlike might find time
In turning time parallel find radical transformation
Are midst similar transformation
What modern rather counterpart development print technology Copernican revolution Renaissance individualism perhaps importantly Reformation
Indeed time begin
The nailing document Wittenberg church door provides u powerful even poetic historical punctum
The sound hammer nail marked precise moment time space start new era even may recognised time even many historian believe story apocryphal
Our time convenient starting point neither poetic prosaic yet final year last century seem constitute start new period history
In history short twentieth century Eric Hobsbawm say end century qualitatively different start century three respect
Firstly longer Eurocentric although rise USA would still mean dominance western civilisation
Secondly globalisation transformed economic social life
Thirdly traditional pattern social relationship disintegrating principally pressure individualism
Hobsbawm divide year since three period Age Catastrophe aftermath Second World War Golden Age extraordinary economic growth early finally The Crisis Decades
For Hobsbawm fin de siecle gloom mark time
For many including Hobsbawm current period insecurity date oil crisis followed Yom Kippur war
The world economy already changing early Galbraith writing The New Industrial State give u convenient marker post
In twenty year followed world lost bearing slid instability crisis It simply much world economy recession true inequality rich poor grown also true operation capitalist economy become uncontrollable
Traditional intervention national economy seemed impotent faced overwhelming power global market ideological position deemed interference market force case undesirable
Commentators began talk society
Which brings u first contemporary counterpart Renaissance world internet
Now key feature global economy postmodernism internet began project funded Department Defence
Faced problem protecting communication structure event nuclear war planner Rand Corporation came solution decentralised network
In mid protocol established enabled communication different network ie truly different domain created help bring order becoming sprawling anarchic system
possibility proliferated military one seven domain net rapidly developed instrument social communication medium research business message
The real explosion growth however came widespread use personal computer time creation World Wide Web
What began military problem involving handful scientist become brave new world cyberspace open anyone PC telephone link
Of course everyone access probably le world population new technology herald cultural revolution much way advent print technology fifteenth century also limited access
As print accelerated pace change
The interconnection financial market mean vast sum money often wealth small nation shifted anywhere world instantaneously touch button
At time disparate protest group organise much greater ease speed might single letter complaint large corporation copied forwarded million activist across globe
The result greater empowerment greater instability
From start internet built within principle decentralisation power would devolved anyone possessed technology
As print help democratise production reading text issue control becomes paramount struggle resist control
For cyberspace might seem wild lawless world hotbed anarchy crime perversion subversion quality wildness embraced frontier spirit
In way net seen liberatory technology giving voice would otherwise silenced oppressive regime place untamed free
One freedom net said give u freedom whoever want
In cyberspace choose world see u
We cast aside fleshly self meat use language cyberpunk construct virtual persona made entirely realm information
In cyberspace identity determined desire biology
However plasticity identity one part general assault self end twentieth century fundamental attack coming development genetics
There long debate relative importance nature versus nurture genetics seemed open prospect finding root cause nature control life
The rise last quarter century ensured genetic determinism would increasingly orthodox position least term public face biology
From onwards book
Wilson Sociobiology Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene body behaviour explained term gene
At first understanding assembled piece piece individual gene identified responsible particular characteristic condition June announced scientist produced first draft entire human genetic code
This mapping human genome second Renaissance parallel
As Copernicus new map heaven reconfigured place world map human genome
In case natural tendency anthropocentrism shaken core
The heliocentric dislocation stable centre one many spinning orbit counterpart genocentric dislocation coherent self multitudinous selfish gene
Each force u reconsider consequently
Looking outward heaven Copernicus rearranged place nature
Looking inward biology map human genome transforms understanding much place nature nature place u
In respect however idea self much still alive
The use title Tom Wolfe book The Me Decade
For Wolfe concern individual personal spiritual development become unwholesome obsession self
Relationships others simply opportunity expressing one self
The appeal fashionable therapy simple say Wolfe It summed notion Let talk Me
The century counterpart Renaissance individualism therefore new culture narcissism according Christopher Lasch come dominate whole development American implication Western society
In ideology Thatcherism Reaganomics rampant degenerate individualism would also find expression economic policy attitude
Cocooned private space selfish Me generation lived world believe Margaret Thatcher thing society
Thus draw parallel radical transformation decade around similar transformation time
We see print heliocentricism individualism latterday counterpart internet genocentricism narcissistic culture
Such comparison may interest could possibly even significant one final parallel I believe truly important challenge posed Reformation posed postmodernity
It become commonplace see science new form religion rite ritual initiation practice esoteric language priesthood martyr
However authority face challenge faced Catholic church time Reformation
The fragmentation belief sixteenth century replayed fragmentation knowledge
Postmodernity unsettling struggle reform must year ago
Both undermine certainty people rely
Both dissolve boundary hitherto seemed natural
Both seek solution local universal
If one major difference postmodernity intentionally unsettling
It actively search celebrates ambivalent unstable
Indeed definition postmodernity undecided contested example fluidity trying describe
Like mythical beast may easy depict recognise see
For Lyotard defining feature incredulity towards metanarratives
The postmodern condition mean longer possible legitimate knowledge appeal grand narrative metadiscourse dialectic spirit emancipation working class Enlightenment belief Progress
Its war totalising discourse eg
Marxism Imperialism constant challenge institutional authority
Indeed authority
There final court appeal refer defer
Instead according Lyotard play game move counter move trying increase space little narrative
The sense semantic weightlessness even evident work Derrida
All word say Derrida placed sou erature erasure inadequate necessary
Signs different meaning different context text sign deemed final ever refer others
There privileged sign transcendent signifier ultimate logo take bearing
No truth unmediated
Nothing stable everything dispersed broken
Even Derrida writing style seems demonstrate fixed position ground beneath foot
Popular reaction science predates Lyotard Report Knowledge
Hiroshima Nagasaki already marked loss innocence
Rachel Carson Silent Spring already stirred environmental conscience attack thinking reductionist science already part youth
The challenge postmodernism however fundamental challenge science science
The cultural position science undermined abuse science longer claim privileged access nature
What tell u longer single unmediated transcendental truth historically contingent collection story anthology little narrative
Its epistemological authority shattered thousand piece thousand local knowledge
As Reformation dissolved boundary sacred secular site clergy laity Postmodern Reformation dissolve boundary lay expert thinking
Luther priesthood believer become priesthood knower
We expert expert experience world
Not surprisingly reaction scientist fierce one might even say Jesuitical
In genteel border clash Snow Two Cultures exploded science war saw demonisation anything science
The rise popular science pushed stake higher
Now science programme proliferate TV book shop whole section devoted popular science science centre built redesigned growing concern Public Understanding Science PUS led wide range initiative
Yet fifteen year feverish PUS activity clear public understand science
A collection fact
An access point
Most importantly human construction
In rejection grand narrative ultimate authority postmodernity reaffirms science capitalism culture thing thing appealed
Just spiritual authority Catholic Church challenged Reformation epistemological authority Science challenged postmodernity
In fragmentation uncertainty Postmodern Reformation truth found subjective lived experience one reading sacred text expert proclamation
Moreover undermining authority expose dilemma conscientious scientist release science public arena time control public
The science made public le control scientist mean
Recent call dialogue science public would acknowledge plurality meaning popular science
The challenge scientist whether able whether willing church scientific opened new priesthood knower likely find congregation

Ask

A rule high priest leader sacred rite arrangement item object name value category etc
item represented level one another
A hierarchy link entity either directly indirectly either vertically diagonally
The direct link hierarchy insofar hierarchical one immediate superior one one subordinate although system largely hierarchical also incorporate alternative hierarchy
Indirect hierarchical link extend vertically upwards downwards via multiple link direction following
All part hierarchy linked vertically one another nevertheless horizontally linked path traveling hierarchy find common direct indirect superior
This akin two report common superior relative amount authority
Organizational form exist alternative complementary hierarchy
one form
Hierarchies special vocabulary
These term easiest understand hierarchy diagrammed see
In organizational context following term often used related hierarchy In mathematical context used different
Most hierarchy use specific vocabulary pertaining subject idea behind
For example object known superior called subordinate called
In business setting superior peer
refers number direct child object graph theory equivalent number connected via outgoing arc directed graph node
Hierarchies categorized based maximum degree highest degree present system whole
Categorization way yield two broad class
In maximum degree
In word object visualized lineup object excluding top bottom one exactly one direct subordinate one direct superior
Note referring every hierarchy property respect level normally level infinite number object
An example linear hierarchy
In one object degree therefore minimum degree higher
For many people word hierarchy automatically evokes image branching hierarchy
Branching hierarchy present within numerous system including
The broad category branching hierarchy subdivided based degree
A branching hierarchy maximum degree approach infinity wide span
Most often system intuitively regarded hierarchical moderate span
Therefore flat hierarchy often viewed hierarchy
For example flat hierarchy numerous atom decomposed subatomic particle
An branching hierarchy least one object two parent object
For example two student report directly equally level authority within hierarchy status
Possibly first use English word hierarchy cited used reference three order three angel depicted century
used related word reference
The Greek term ἱεραρχία mean rule priest ἱεράρχης meaning president sacred rite ἱερεύς priest ἀρχή amongst others first place power rule Dionysius credited first use abstract noun
Since hierarchical church see church table organization hierarchical modern sense word traditionally pinnacle head hierarchy term came refer similar organizational method setting
A hierarchy typically depicted height level represents level status width level represents quantity item level relative whole
For example company could could thousand people subordinate
These pyramid typically diagrammed note diagram hierarchical example serve emphasize size difference level
An example triangle diagram appears right
An diagram hierarchy within depicted tree form
More recently computer allowed storage navigation ever larger data set various method developed represent hierarchy manner make efficient use available space computer screen
Examples include fractal map
In design field mainly graphic design successful layout formatting content document heavily dependent rule
Visual hierarchy also important proper organization file computer
An example visually representing hierarchy Nested cluster
The Nested cluster represents hierarchical relationship using layer information
The child element within parent element
This structure representing hierarchy effective representing simple relationship
For example directing someone open file computer desktop one may first direct towards main folder subfolders within main folder
They keep opening file within folder designated file located
For complicated hierarchy stair structure represents hierarchical relationship use visual stacking
Visually imagine top downward staircase beginning left descending right
The child element towards bottom stair parent element top
This structure effective representing complicated hierarchy step placed obvious sequence
Further step concealed unless step revealed sequence
In computer desktop example file sought found another file opened
The link desired file within another document
All step must completed final destination reached
In plain English hierarchy thought The first requirement also interpreted mean hierarchy association two object always
The second requirement asserts hierarchy must leader common object
Mathematically general form hierarchy
The case entire poset constituted element
Within system element share particular unambiguous property
Objects property value grouped together resulting referred
Hierarchy particularly used refer poset class organized term increasing complexity
Operations addition subtraction multiplication division often performed certain sequence order
Usually addition subtraction performed multiplication division already applied problem
The use parenthesis also representation hierarchy show operation done prior following one
For example
In problem typically one would multiply first based rule mathematical hierarchy
But parenthesis placed one know operation within parenthesis first continuing problem
These rule largely dominant algebraic problem one include several step order solve
The use hierarchy mathematics beneficial order quickly efficiently solve problem without go process slowly dissecting problem
Most rule known proper way solving certain equation
A nested hierarchy hierarchical ordering
The concept nesting exemplified Russian
Each doll encompassed another doll way outer doll
The outer doll hold inner doll next outer doll hold remaining inner doll
Matryoshkas represent nested hierarchy level contains one object one size doll generalized nested hierarchy allows multiple object within level object one parent level
The general concept demonstrated mathematically formulated following example A square always also referred quadrilateral polygon shape
In way hierarchy
However consider set polygon using classification
A square quadrilateral never etc
Nested hierarchy organizational scheme behind systematic classification
For example using original version laid edition human formulated Taxonomies may change frequently seen underlying concept nested hierarchy always
In many programming taxonomy syntax model well fractal mathematics nested hierarchy including Russian doll also used illustrate property
Recursion included subset hierarchical programming recursive thinking synonymous form hierarchical thinking logic
A containment hierarchy direct extrapolation concept
All ordered set still nested every set must two set identical
The shape example modified demonstrate The notation mean subset equal
A general example containment hierarchy demonstrated
Two type containment hierarchy containment hierarchy containment hierarchy
A subsumptive hierarchy child compositional hierarchy child
A hierarchy also subsumptive compositional
A containment hierarchy classification object class general specific
Other name type hierarchy taxonomic hierarchy hierarchy
The last term describes relationship object member higher class
The taxonomical structure outlined subsumptive containment hierarchy
Using example Linnaean taxonomy seen object part level member level specifically human primate primate mammal
A subsumptive hierarchy also defined abstractly hierarchy
For example Linnaean hierarchy outlined entity name like way group specie fit animal
A containment hierarchy ordering part make system composed part
Most engineered structure whether natural artificial broken manner
The compositional hierarchy every person encounter every moment
Every person reduced composed composed composed composed composed
In fact last two level apply least
Moreover level inherit property
In particular example also seen lower level property scalar quality molecule bigger atom cell bigger molecule etc
Both concept commonly exist compositional hierarchy required general property
These characterized
involves entity causing property higher level entity child entity may interact yield parent entity parent composed least partly child
refers effect incorporation entity entity property interaction
Furthermore entity found level
Almost every system organization applied world arranged hierarchically
By common definition every government every government hierarchical
Socioeconomic system stratified social hierarchy society hierarchical
Most regardless internal governance structure operate hierarchy
Many leadership
Families viewed hierarchical structure term first cousin removed second cousin etc
depicted
All requisite life organized using
must often follow hierarchical learn one must first learn learn calculus one must first learn
Even hierarchy numerous scheme attempt document
Hierarchies infused daily life viewed trivial
While example often clearly depicted hierarchical form classic example hierarchy exist numerous system branching structure immediately apparent
For example system hierarchical
Using example top level binding concept consists object letter
The next level zone object digit
This example object parent
The hierarchy continues downward generate theory unique code format second third letter position allow object
Most system also hierarchical
The regarded infinitely hierarchical finite bound number digit used decimal point
structured
In organizational hierarchy single person group subsequent level represents lesser authority
Most organization structured manner including
The unit person within organization depicted hierarchically
In conceptual authority turned apex bottom base top
This mode represents idea member higher ranking responsible member lower ranking
Empirically observe nature large proportion complex biological system exhibit hierarchic structure
On theoretical ground could expect complex system hierarchy world complexity evolve simplicity
hierarchy analysis performed laid empirical foundation would
The theoretical foundation summarized Thermodynamics
When modeled general abstraction exhibit behavior relation characterized hierarchy
Within use hierarchy
On upper left arm parent lower left arm parent
This used almost everything built model
Many grammatical theory involve hierarchy
distinguish subject object different subject object marker via hierarchy person
In system three four person placed hierarchy
To distinguish subject object used object outranks subject
The structure musical composition often understood hierarchically example see composer linguist Ray
The sum note piece understood surface reduced successively sparse fundamental type motion
The level structure operate Schenker theory foreground seen detail musical score middle ground roughly summary essential contrapuntal progression background one basic counterpoint structure shared gamut tonal music literature
The music organized hierarchically pitch deriving importance relationship secondary theme key brought back tonic recapitulation primary theme
connects specifically feminist hierarchy gender see book even pointing primary theme often previously called masculine secondary theme feminine
In various enumerated sometimes organized hierarchically according certain brand
In random example asymmetry significance level structure small part whole hierarchical array depend meaning membership larger hierarchy activity human life productive activity serf guided moral life moral life guided practical reason practical reason used moral political life serf contemplative reason whereby contemplate God
Practical reason set aside time resource contemplative reason
In work diverse theorist important critique hierarchical advanced
James famously asserts work Radical Empiricism clear distinction type category constant unwritten goal scientific reasoning discovered success declared
But aspect world organized differently involving inherent intractable ambiguity scientific question often considered unresolved
Hierarchy ethic emerged Western Europe West Asia North Africa around
In aspect term hierarchy refers distinguishable real unreal
others multiple interpretation criticize hierarchy commonly found within human society especially social relationship
Hierarchies present part society business school family etc
These relationship often viewed necessary
Entities stand hierarchical arrangement animal human plant etc
In culture God also addition hierarchy
However feminist Marxists critical theorist others analyze hierarchy term value power arbitrarily assigns one group another
Hierarchical ethic offer way logical reasoning compatible religious commitment
In culture hierarchy within humanity The man family woman child social class might hierarchy follows king civic official craftsman unskilled worker

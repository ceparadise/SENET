While important teach language relevant employer equally important student learn teach new language
The best way learn learn progamming language learn multiple programming language programming paradigm
The difficulty learning th language half difficulty th
Yet understand programming language one must implement one
Ideally every computer science major would take compiler class
At minimum every computer science major implement interpreter
The following language provide reasonable mixture paradigm practical application Racket dialect Lisp aggressively simple syntax
For small fraction student syntax impediment
To blunt student fundamental mental barrier accepting alien syntactic regime even temporarily lack mental dexterity survive career computer science
Racket powerful macro system facility programming thoroughly erase line data code
If taught correctly Lisp liberates
C terse unforgiving abstraction silicon
C remains without rival programming embedded system
Learning C imparts deep understanding dominant von Neumann architecture way language
Given intimate role poor C programming play prevalence buffer overflow security vulnerability critical programmer learn program C properly
JavaScript good representative semantic model popular dynamic language Python Ruby Perl
As native language web pragmatic advantage unique
Squeak modern dialect Smalltalk purest language
It imparts essence

Haskell crown jewel family language
Fully exploiting laziness Haskell come closest programming pure mathematics major programming language
necessary evil
But since must taught must taught full
In particular computer science major leave grasp even
Any assembly language
Since popular might well
Learning compiler best way learn assembly since give computer scientist intuitive sense code transformed
Computer scientist understand generative programming macro lexical dynamic scope closure continuation function dynamic dispatch subtyping module functors monad semantic concept distinct specific syntax
Computer scientist must solid grasp formal logic proof
Proof algebraic manipulation natural deduction engages reasoning common routine programming task
Proof induction engages reasoning used construction recursive function
Computer scientist must fluent formal mathematical notation reasoning rigorously basic discrete structure set tuples sequence function power set
For computer scientist important cover reasoning Students learn enough number theory study implement common cryptographic protocol
Students certainly see common rare yet unreasonably effective data structure algorithm
But important knowing specific algorithm data structure usually easy enough look computer scientist must understand design algorithm greedy dynamic strategy span gap algorithm ideal implementation
At minimum computer scientist seeking stable employment know following Computer scientist ready implement extend algorithm operates data structure including ability search element add element remove element
For completeness computer scientist know imperative functional version algorithm
A grasp theory prerequisite research graduate school
Theory invaluable provides hard boundary problem provides mean circumventing initially appear hard boundary
Computational complexity legitimately claim one truly predictive theory computer science
A computer scientist know boundary tractability computability lie
To ignore limit invite frustration best case failure worst
At undergraduate level theory cover least model computation computational complexity
Models computation cover automaton regular language regular expression pushdown automaton language formal grammar Turing machine lambda calculus undecidability
At undergraduate level student learn least enough complexity understand difference P NP
To avoid leaving wrong impression student solve large problem NP reduction SAT use modern SAT solver
There substitute solid understanding computer architecture
Computer scientist understand computer transistor
The understanding architecture encompass standard level abstraction transistor gate adder muxes flip flop ALUs control unit cache RAM
An understanding GPU model computing important foreseeable future
A good understanding cache bus hardware memory management essential achieving good performance modern system
To get good grasp machine architecture student design simulate small CPU
Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes operating system
As computer scientist aware kernel handle system call paging scheduling filesystems internal resource management
A good understanding operating system secondary understanding compiler architecture achieving performance
Understanding operating system I would interpret liberally include runtime system becomes especially important programming embedded system without one
It important student get hand dirty real operating system
With Linux virtualization easier ever
To get better understanding kernel student could Given ubiquity network computer scientist firm understanding network stack routing protocol within network
The mechanic building efficient reliable transmission protocol like TCP top unreliable transmission protocol like IP magic computer scientist
It core knowledge
Computer scientist must understand involved protocol design example choose TCP choose UDP
Programmers need understand larger social implication congestion use UDP large scale well
Given frequency modern programmer encounter network programming helpful know protocol existing standard Computer scientist understand exponential back packet collision resolution mechanism involved congestion control
Every computer scientist implement following No student ever pas intro neworking class without sniffing instructor Google query
It probably going far require student implement reliable transmission protocol scratch atop IP I say personally transformative experience student
The sad truth security majority security vulnerability come sloppy programming
The sadder truth many school poor job training programmer secure code
Computer scientist must aware mean program compromised
They need develop sense defensive programming mind thinking code might attacked
Security kind training best distributed throughout entire curriculum discipline warn student native vulnerability
At minimum every computer scientist need understand A reader pointed computer scientist also need aware basic IT security measure choose legitimately good password properly configure firewall iptables
Cryptography make much digital life possible
Computer scientist understand able implement following concept well common pitfall Since common fault implementation cryptosystems every computer scientist know acquire random number task hand
At least nearly every data breach shown computer scientist need know salt hash password storage
Every computer scientist pleasure breaking ciphertext using cryptosystems statistical tool
RSA everyone
Every student create digital certificate set http apache
It surprisingly arduous
Student also write console web client connects SSL
As strictly practical matter computer scientist know use GPG use authentication ssh encrypt directory hard disk
Software testing must distributed throughout entire curriculum
A course software engineering cover basic style testing substitute practicing art
Students graded test case turn
I use test case turned student student
Students seem care much developing defensive test case unleash hell come sandbagging classmate
Programmers often write software programmer worse
User interface design broadly user experience design might underappreciated aspect computer science
There misconception even among professor user experience soft skill ca taught
In reality modern user experience design anchored principle human factor engineering industrial design
If nothing else computer scientist know interface need make ease executing task proportional frequency task multiplied importance
As practicality every programmer comfortable designing usable web interface HTML CSS JavaScript
Good visualization rendering data fashion human perceive information
This easy thing
The modern world sea data exploiting local maximum human perception key making sense
Parallelism back uglier ever
The unfortunate truth harnessing parallelism requires deep knowledge architecture multicore cache bus GPUs etc
And practice
Lots practice
It clear final answer parallel programming solution emerged
For student learn CUDA OpenCL
Threads flimsy abstraction parallelism particularly cache cache coherency involved
But thread popular tricky worth learning
Pthreads reasonably portable thread library learn
For anyone interested parallelism MPI prerequisite
On principle side seem enduring
The principle software engineering change fast programming language
A good course practice team software construction provides working knowledge pitfall inherent endeavor
It recommended several reader student break team three role leader rotating three different project
Learning attack maneuver large existing codebase skill programmer master one best learned school instead job
All student need understand centralized version control system like svn distributed version control system like git
A working knowlege debugging tool like gdb valgrind go long way finally become necessary
As demand secure reliable software increase formal method may one day end mean delivering
At present formal modeling verification software remains challenging progress field steady get easier every year
There may even come day within lifetime computer science major formal software construction expected skill
Every computer scientist least moderately comfortable using one theorem prover
I think matter one
Learning use theorem prover immediately impact coding style
For example one feel instinctively allergic writing statement cover possibility
And writing recursive function user theorem provers strong urge eliminate
There discipline dominated clever graphic
The field driven toward even defined good enough
As better way teach clever programming solid appreciation optimizing effort graphic simulation
Over half coding hack I learned came study graphic
Simple ray tracer constructed line code
It good mental hygiene work transformation necessary perform perspective projection wireframe engine
Data structure like BSP tree algorithm like rendering great example clever design
In graphic simulation many
Robotics may one engaging way teach introductory programming
Moreover cost robotics continues fall threshold passed enable personal robotics revolution
For program unimaginable degree personal physical automation horizon
If reason outsized impact early history computing computer scientist study artificial intelligence
While original dream intelligent machine seems far artificial intelligence spurred number practical field machine learning data mining natural language processing
Aside outstanding technical merit sheer number job opening relevance engineer indicates every computer scientist grasp fundamental machine learning
Machine learning doubly emphasizes need understanding probability statistic
At undergraduate level core concept include Bayesian network clustering learning
Databases common useful ignore
It useful understand fundamental data structure algorithm power database engine since programmer often enough reimplement database system within larger software system
Relational algebra relational calculus stand exceptional success story model computation
Unlike UML modeling ER modeling seems reasonable mechanism visualing encoding design constraint upon software artifact
A computer scientist set operate LAMP stack one good idea lot hard work away running company
My suggestion limited blind spot knowledge

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
We technology organization supporting line business
We currently managing large budget portfolio application hundred project impact application project affect single application affect multiple application
We tracking lot detail high level information including So lot data I trying figure use data help people understand really going help people technology management business management make strategic decision
What right dashboard view view useful management look
Are standard report metric ratio etc included
I see lot I ca find concrete specific people think key view help drive strategy
As I trying figure best way show strategy help drive strategic decision making
Any suggestion
Just reading synopsis sound like coming wrong end first
The dashboard report metric outgrowth strategy
So rather asking best view measurement question would strategy many project information need see ensure going right direction
For example apps
What decides one changed
That information need dashboard
You lot project affect multiple apps
Presumably apps modified goal mind
So need information tell whether goal going achieved something either project goal need modified
Senior manager interested bottom line
Most want answer simple strategic question Are black red
Therefore information provide manager limited information answer question course financial quarter
My suggestion average increase revenue course month show weekly basis spreadsheet
Then glance manager able tell holding steady profit area growing term profit area declining term profit
I want point still possible something currently generating profit show trend loss decreasing increasing rate mean approaching profitability
Likewise also possible show something generating profit actually decreasing amount profit month
From strategic management perspective something show profit one month mean strategic manager want invest moving forward
For instance profitable project decreasing profit may nearing end product lifecycle
Maybe strategic manager may want maintain red likely wo want bet entire business one area
In summary important strategic manager seeing thing changing period time use information crystal ball help better prepare future
You appear roadmap various application per comment etc one simple metric would categorise project portfolio map different class application
That way could see whether investing time effort developing improving application future opposed minimum keep running retired replaced
So draw matrix application class one axis buy sell hold develop strategic development etc project type axis maintenance development cosmetic bug fix legislative change etc
You list project cell count put anticipated resource investment ROI figure
If see whether effort strategy aligned make informed decision
Even snapshot time help clarify give clearer insight
You try
It exactly product build report metric project data

Graduate Computer Science Portfolio I interested solving problem since young age
I used complete massive puzzle mom I child I intrigued special step mom always took solve puzzle
First would find edge piece common start puzzler something else
She would start putting piece pile similar color
I could figure I realized dividing puzzle smaller puzzle
The first puzzle find edge piece find color final puzzle find piece color actually fit
This turned piece puzzle smaller puzzle easier solve first reduction possible unsolved piece
I also always gamer
This mean I sat end night Super Mario although I later year teenager mean I never neglected family game night
We would spend hour personal favorite
I would always spy family would detective searching London
time I would win using false flag misdirect toward different landing zone would entire opposite side London I enjoyed total freedom immunity long arm law
Both scenario taught great deal win game solve large puzzle
I think really got Computer Science I saw huge opportunity make money still enjoying task solving problem elegant fashion
No matter solution I found always better robust solution problem
When I first started education path toward Computer Science I perplexed complexity daunting endeavor
Nothing made sense learning new language
I taken foreign language German Spanish I excelled picking different syntax grammar quickly fluently
Why could I understand new language computation
I ended taking Psychology course quite well
I enjoyed much I decided head path Psychology
I later learned people test well path toward CS also tend people enjoy Psych
This make sense I wanted learn solve problem complex framework I started seeing connection computer brain I delved greater detail Biological Psychology Cognitive Psychology course
As I went degree Psychology I ended returning Computer Science take course undergraduate credit I became even enthralled aspect machine learning data mining well interaction
I toyed around medium art well quickly became easy I learned Computer Science
I needed challenge dynamic environment brain prune properly
I made decision double major Computer Science Psychology half way education
When I completed undergraduate degree Psychology I easily convinced Joel Henry complete
Computer Science rather settle two undergraduate degree
It difficult decision make I already grown love faculty Computer Science department felt like I home
I little apprehensive first lack female occupancy I managed overcome hurdle taking additional course Psychology Math
I completed minor Math Media Arts little difficulty full appreciation tedious nature developing animation film well newfound addiction mathematics
I enjoying past year Missoula Montana hope make home good amount time
If I move Missoula always hold special place heart I lucky I end retiring
If go according plan Montana home month snow sport summer home get nice enough camp hunt fish
I want personally thank following committee member appearing portfolio defense
You allowed complete graduate degree successfully teach many important programming mathematical technique along way

In explicit form multisets appeared work
Other mathematician formalized multisets began study precise mathematical object structure century
One simplest natural example multiset factor number
Here underlying set element set prime
For example number give multiset
A related example multiset solution algebraic equation
A example two solution
However case number
Thus multiset solution equation could could
In latter case solution multiplicity
A special case matrix defined multiset root
However choice made usual definition eigenvalue refer characteristic polynomial possibility give rise different notion multiplicity therefore different multisets
The eigenvalue matrix kernel often smaller multiplicity root characteristic polynomial algebraic multiplicity latter larger
The set eigenvalue also set root multiset root need either one defined using algebraic multiplicity using geometric multiplicity
Basically two different way appoaching multiset concept
Just like set axiomatic definition may used performed Wayne Blizard
The complete list multiset axiom contain folowing subsection However common way one Constructing multisets using given set theory ZFC concept natural number matter axiomatic Peano constructed use set theory
According constructive definition given following
Within may formally defined set set
The set called
For number occurrence number
Like function function may defined set
With definition multiset written defined multiset defined
Given universe element set must live definition simplified extending multiplicity whole universe
We multiplicity function set nonnegative integer obtained extending value element
The concept multiset concept set
A multiset corresponds ordinary set multiplicity every element one opposed larger natural number
An may define multiset sometimes written multiplicity element number index
The condition possible element occurs infinitely many time family even infinite multiset multiplicity must finite number
It possible extend definition multiset allowing multiplicity individual element infinite cardinal instead natural number
Not property carry generalization however article us definition finite multiplicity
The set indicator function normal set generalized multiplicity function multisets
The subset set function defined The set indicator function set minimum function indicator function The set indicator function set maximum function indicator function The set indicator function set indicator function The set indicator function set absolute difference indocator function The set indicator function smaller equal superset The set indicator function product indicator function cartesian factor The finite set sum indicator function value The concept set indicator function releasing constraint value must allow value
The resulting function called function defines
The multiset universe set element multiplicity Please note index denotes multiset either given axiom definition rather crisp set
The normal set notation turn multiset support
denotes multiplicity function defined whole universe
The concept intersection union difference symmetric difference subset cartesian product cardinality multisets defined formula
Some definition similar defined support
Other parameter multisets may defined similar fuzzy set well RelCard Hgt A Width A
Further operation follows The multiplicity function sum multiplicity function The multiset natural number may defined These example demonstrate operation multiplicity function
Two multisets equivalent also equivalent Multisets disjoint iff support disjoint according standard definition set
For disjoint multisets intersection give well well scalar multiplication union give result multiset sum denoted multiplicity function given Note one summands may greater zero
Example Symmetric difference For disjoint multisets following hold true The generalized finite family multiets follows Given family multisets Index set I
I n
This family iff A family multisets disjoint iff family underlying support disjoint standard sense family set
Independend pair intersection disjoint family give well mutiplication case finite index set I union finite multiset sum give result multipicity function given Again one summands greater zero
For disjoint family multisets following hold true The free set see taken set finite multisets element drawn monoid operation multiset sum empty multiset identity element
Such monoids also known finite formal sum element natural coefficient
The free subset free commutative monoid contains multisets element drawn except empty multiset
formal sum
linear combination element integer coefficient
Equivalently may seen finite multisets element drawn
The number multisets cardinality element taken finite set cardinality called
This number written author notation meant resemble used instance Stanley could pronounced multichoose resemble choose
Unlike binomial coefficient multiset theorem multiset coefficient would occur confused unrelated occur
The value multiset coefficient given explicitly second expression binomial coefficient many author fact avoid separate notation write binomial coefficient
So number multisets number subset cardinality set cardinality
The analogy binomial coefficient stressed writing numerator expression match expression binomial coefficient using falling factorial power There example cardinality element taken set cardinality namely
There also cardinality set cardinality namely
One simple way prove equality multiset coefficient binomial coefficient given involves representing multisets following way
First consider notation multisets would represent form This multiset cardinality made element set cardinality
The number character including dot vertical line used notation
The number vertical line
The number multisets cardinality number way arrange vertical line among character thus number subset cardinality set cardinality
Equivalently number way arrange dot among character number subset cardinality set cardinality
This thus value multiset coefficient equivalencies One may define generalized binomial coefficient required nonnegative integer may negative
If value coefficient
Then number multisets cardinality set cardinality A multiset coefficient may given The recurrence may interpreted follows
Let source set
There always exactly one empty multiset size larger multisets give initial condition
Now consider case
A multiset cardinality element might might contain instance final element
If appear removing one left multiset cardinality element every multiset arise give total If appear original multiset equal multiset cardinality element Thus The multiplicative formula allows definition multiset coefficient extended replacing arbitrary number negative real complex With definition one generalization negative binomial formula one variable set justifies calling negative binomial coefficient This formula valid complex number
It also interpreted identity actually serve definition arbitrary power series constant coefficient equal point definition identity hold one expects notably formula used prove identity multiset coefficient
If nonpositive integer term zero infinite series becomes finite sum
However value including positive integer rational number series infinite
The set may represented
Its represented
The set may represented monomial
Its power set represented The multiset may represented monomial
The multiset submultisets represented polynomial The multiset submultisets multiset represented polynomial That count number
The multiset represented polynomial containing element hit called submultiset called
The set sample equal So number hit See distribution hit
The infinite set finite multisets element taken set may represented The formal solution make sense set multisets intermediate result make sense set multisets
The infinite set finite multisets element taken set represented monomial The infinite multiset finite multisets element taken multiset represented monomial may taken special case The infinite multiset finite multisets element taken multiset represented monomial This explains multisets negative set
The negative count number element taken
A represented monomial
A finite likewise represented polynomial
It convenient consider
For example multiset represented polynomial cumulant generating function cardinality derivative mean value
The number called
The infinite set integer represented
The mean value standard deviation undefined
Nevertheless function
The derivative function
A finite represented cumulant generating function This representation unique different multisets different cumulant generating function
See case number question energy level physical system
The function multiset real number mean standard deviation derivative
The function set consisting single real number
The derivative number
So concept concept
The function constant multiset element equal real number derivative number irrespective
The function multiset sum element two multisets number sum two function There general formula computing cumulant generating function product special case constant time multiset number The multiset multiset
For example
The cumulant generating function The standard like limit large multisets number
This limit make sense multiset number derivative cumulant generating function multisets question make sense limit well defined
The constant term vanishes differentiation
The term vanish limit
So standard normal distribution mean derivative cumulant generating function
For normal distribution mean standard deviation derivative cumulant generating function
Multisets various application
They becoming main structure combinatorics search higher rigorousness modern combinatorics developed set multisets
Multisets become important tool database
For instance multisets often used implement relation database system
Multisets also play important role computer science
There also application
For instance used multisets device investigate property family set
He wrote The notion set take account multiple occurrence one member yet kind information frequently importance
We need think set root polynomial f x spectrum linear operator
Different generalization multisets introduced studied applied solving problem

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

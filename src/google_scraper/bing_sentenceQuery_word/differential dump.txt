We took course differential equation mixed linear algebra I see use linear algebra graphic transformation I see use differential equation CompSci specifically even generally
Post comment
It us built pair coupled differential equation solve Sudoku puzzle chaotically
Oh I based research final year project paper used similar technique solve small instance TSP game called Bridges
That awesome
Constraint processing area getting PhD another year
This might end distracting bit today
I honestly ca think direct theory application pure CS problem top head
However plenty modeling problem require diffeq
For example lot disease modeling physic modeling problem require modeling flow obviously requires diffeq
Yeah grey area CS applied CS
OP mention graphic scope presumably AI machine learning tend heavy diff eq
But yeah lot use core Comp Sci
It dichotomy
The core CS discrete stuff differential equation framed term continuous variation often useful hop across divide perhaps multiple time trying simplify approximate problem
In school professor called process proving order execution function properly called discrete differential
I continue graduate study phrase stuck something look
Understanding DEs mathematical level help motivate numerical analysis used modelling
You definitely look rest comment post
Using continuous approximate discrete used time pure CS
randomized algorithm approximation algorithm algorithmic analysis
It surprising learn one useful tool analysis crop time area outside physic modelling
There fun anecdote Richard Feynman time Thinking Machines
Apparently used differential equation model performance machine building came better estimate one made using discrete technique To find well would work practice Feynman write computer program QCD
Since computer language Richard really familiar Basic made parallel version Basic wrote program simulated hand estimate fast would run Connection Machine
He excited result
Hey Danny going believe machine actually something useful
According Feynman calculation Connection Machine even without special hardware floating point arithmetic would outperform machine CalTech building QCD calculation
From point Richard pushed u toward looking numerical application machine
By end summer Richard completed analysis behavior router
Feynman router equation term variable representing continuous quantity average number bit message address
I much accustomed seeing analysis term inductive proof case analysis taking derivative number respect time
Our discrete analysis said needed seven buffer per chip Feynman equation suggested needed five
We decided play safe ignore Feynman
The decision ignore Feynman analysis made September next spring wall
The chip designed slightly big manufacture way solve problem cut number buffer per chip back five
Since Feynman equation claimed could safely unconventional method analysis started looking better better u
We decided go ahead make chip smaller number buffer
Full story I thought I perfect anecdotal story I come comment scooped
That depends quite bit generally define Computer Science
If consider discrete problem CS I ca think common application differential equation
However anything continuous physical component probably riddled differential equation
Obviously modeling physical system largely solving difficult differential equation
However might le apparent reverse modeling computer imaging basically interpreting sensor determine state world
Optimal control problem robotics consist almost entirely differential equation
Financial analysis closely related problem stochastic differential equation robotics
Finally others pointed differential equation sometimes used show convergence optimization algorithm used
train neural network machine learning
The big PDE optimal control everywhere
Many technique discrete MDPs seen approximation PDE
A nice example using differential equation prove something optimization method Nesterov acceleration
One additional aspect CS related differential equation linear equation solving
A lot useful intuition thing like eigenvalue graph Laplacians come linear differential equation
It computer science exactly going understand hardware component make computer certainly quantum component going need differential equation
Generally though CS discrete differential equation really come model much CS directly
If going model almost phenomenon like example need differential equation
If graphic transformation count useful physic model well
Of course differential equation necessary understand science general matter kind science
Differentials used Machine Learning model rate change cost function represents error neural network output
The derivative cost function used gradient descent process finding minimum cost function
ML expert please correct I wrong I learning
The cost function diffeq right gradient descent technique us differential equation find minimum value cost function I think simply computing gradient qualifies differential equation
It differentiation sure I suppose literal sense could considered differential equation since equation contains differential trivial usually meant term
A differential equation mathematical equation relates function derivative
sound pretty good relates derivative function constant
Differential equation used le common form Machine Learning though least consider Bayesian method ML vague
Hamiltonian MCMC simulates described differential equation simulated using
The purpose Hamiltonian MCMC draw random sample probability distribution described probability density x unknown normalizing constant whose gradient available usually automatic differentiation tool like

Since generic problem much like integration used lot different place
The advantage using Hamiltonian MCMC vanilla Metropolis utilizes gradient information making efficient much like gradient descent efficient simulated annealing
grad f x diff eq solve differential equation solve function
Thanks yeah fixed answer
More generally field optimization using diffeq thing machine learning often expressed optimization problem
I understood word
Yes
Stream calculus general paradigm reasoning coinductive list model data stream
The stream derivative allows lot formal trick power series coefficient modelled stream
Stream derivative model usual rule differentiation giving many useful identity stream
These idea generalize complicated coinductive type
Will use
Probably
But used reason program
Can link paper
I done coinduction coalgebras I never stumbled connection differentiation
I uncertain JungleJesus talking These behavioral differential equation rely operator call derivative analogue see study regular expression
The idea actually elegant root combinatorics number theory hence introduction analytic field respectively analytic combinatorics analytic number theory
Recall given analytic function everywhere differentiable
Therefore admits laurent series centered around f x f x equally represent vector within R mega f f f f f
Now let f denote initial value f let f denote derivative f
Consider common operation stream go next element
The idea model operation root derivative D f f f f f f specify stream pair equation one differential equation denotes stream shall change shift index another initial equation denotes f initially
This actually exact idea famed regular expression derivative paper use
If look closely derivative satisfy product rule f x f f x f x x f f x f x I would hesitate say bonafide connection differential equation underlying idea le similar
You get compact functional specification using derivative operator traditional coinductive structural construct
Here example
Like Hinze CSC
Derivatives used machine learning
Should surprising process modeled using
Way back college I made smoke simulator used DiffyQ
I touched since mostly forgotten actually work
I used library use though basically flowing simulation water smoke fire wind etc using
DiffEq In MCMC algorithm differential equation play interesting role determine dynamic
In computational neuroscience differential equation play extremely critical role understanding mechanims system
In AI insight current progress DL understood DEq
It pretty interesting important subject
Not strictly CS fair bit application image processing
At least core algorithm PDE based high performance solution often take quite lot shortcut
Examples algorithm
Just every advanced feature Photoshop relies PDEs extent
Here series slide give idea
But general method looking
In high dynamic range imaging
Did learn series technique solving differential equation
Suppose f function given power series f x E x Then formally differentiate term term often need write differential equation term sum solve f x find function match solution
Now reverse suppose recurrence relationship use write equation find differential equation model solve differential equation using technique learned write solution power series found value sequence
The function found called generating function series
There book called Generatingfunctionology Herbert Wilf give good introduction subject
You download author If really want get using continuous technique solve harder problem computer science check Concrete Math
It lot great example foundational computer science problem solved using technique calculus
Along answer telling used machine learning
I think computer sciency application differential form simply computer scientist usually try state problem way
The natural science train work train describe phenomenon using differential equation workflow naturally includes
And case long time standard
Not much u
Also necessarily natural science domain continuous discrete
We continuous problem many discrete problem might use continuous relaxation solve continuous many problem could stated differential equation
I think biggest reason done often simply trained
I think computer sciency application differential form simply computer scientist usually try state problem way
That ridiculous
I sure trying prove
I fully aware exists method solving differential equation I taken course subject I implemented used many different numerical algorithm solving ordinary partial differential equation
But I trying say initial statement
The differential equation solve often natural science often create
Like could wanted describe algorithm time complexity term derivative get similar definition one
I trying think example could theory used differential equation I ca think offhand
Since regular language linear algebra kleene algebra maybe could use continuous approach automaton theory
I sure language I tough time thinking similar analysis could work Turing machine
Maybe database information algebra relational algebra could get continuous mathematical work
Anyway I trying say computer scientist first approximation try describe field solution problem analyze property field try describe steady state differential equation
We often try use graph network fixed point discrete mathematics describe solve problem
Fourier transforms example partial differential equation direct translation German I know right name English
There used everywhere converting signal example JPEG analog signal digital
etc
I hated Edit Yep PDE used describe everything wave form like signal wire DSL ethernet air wireless communication etc
I remember I struggled understanding UMTS encoding
I get fourier transforms PDEs
Yes FT application solving PDEs linear operation
I hope much
My CS program omits major requirement
You missing much
Differential equation used physical simulation modeling pretty much nowhere else
You hope
That differential equation use computer science
Analog computer example used terrain tracking radar make decision sec supersonic military aircraft
The abstract algebraic notion differentiation least two fascinating theoretical application Computer Science
The differential lambda calculus show name say differentiate lambda term syntactically
It theory including semantic model first application quantum computing
See original paper Combinatorial specie specie show differentiate arbitrary structure tree list cyclice list etc
It computer science application type isomorphism cute
See paper I encountered university course operating system
They used analysing page usage different queue parameter
I brush ten year degree come play signal theory
Is EE stuff
yeah I wanted build software anyway
The real world differential equation think term crude abstraction
So computational study real world phenomenon incorporate
The standard algorithm producing distorted map continuous area cartograms cartographic jargon based numerically solving system differential equation
I consider computer science others may take narrower view computer science comprises
Z domain filtering application requires good knowledge differential equation
And EE stuff may job someone asks program filter
Anything modeling involves motion movement change involve differential equation extent
If work graphic special effect machine learning may need
With machine learning build model would require mathematics matrix algebra diff eq calculus come play
I course differential equation I see great use pure computer science field besides computer graphic electronics etc
The reason computer scientist interested lot science use A LOT computer science helping develop technique solve
Simulations physical fenomena supercomputer usually nothing solving lot differential equation
We computer scientist need insight helping solve others
I use neural network signal processing time implement physic game time
Most time code never written way resembles differential equation I work I already using I ever learned anything academically I think simpler concept programming calculus
Along answer mentioned already practice
Much CS compiler parsing graph processing database etc relies algebra like processing symbolic data abstract way
Like solving differential equation apply knowledge abstracted thing
You intuitively make sense rather proved take right answer
It difficult skill one majority programmer weak skill broad application
Not exactly topic
But Alan Turing cited paper Algorithms AI rather paper
wot I vaguely remember using differential equation Rule prove property asymptotic tight bound algorithm class
It unconventional way proving still worked
Differential equation used heavily spacial modelling instance telling drone go fast need function time
Computers generate system ODE solve approximate position thing space
The industry primarily requires use advanced math ask believe game programming
Specifically primarily useful collision detection linear algebra used extensively mapping world render onto monitor
On related note game programmer highly worst compensated industry
So want

Trying hourly incremental backup single Postgres server
I following setup restart I base backup Which made big file folder added KB file I assume WALs
What I understand
The WALs change
Is pg supposed copy
How decide
Perhaps I need set
I seen several site pg mailing list bacula postgres page say need call I believe required
Is true
Secondary question How often WALs get written
What trigger write
It seems update WAL I DML psql
Or edit table pgAdmin close window
I figured would write commit
Best practice
week
Archive WALs machine PG remote machine
You want incremental backup archive folder remote storage
Should need restore backup basic scenario need base backup starting point entire content archive folder replay transactional activity happened starting point crash
Also avoid file archive folder piling forever want new base backup time time delete file archived new base backup
There existing tool help great deal
It provides PITR
There command logical backup
ca take incremental differential
The way via log archiving
In theory could take new full backup binary diff last backup upload diff
This strike fragile inefficient way thing though I really would recommend
Additionally PgBarman support integration via hook script automate much backup rotation management
Again may option Windows

Dump
This one word I heard among hardcore programmer hacker yet I never knew mean
I found almost everywhere center around software digital hardware
They say something like dumping file dump CPU dump memory
What feat usually performed
A data taken storage medium
unedited
For example content recorded state core specified time
In Unix software backup file system
In essence dump content taken storage medium contains state medium used mostly debugging purpose
In programming dump something mean get content
For example one say mean query content memory given address store somewhere analysis result called
In computing core dump properly memory dump storage dump consists recorded state working memory computer program specific time generally program terminated abnormally crashed
The name come day magnetic core memory used introduction semiconductor memory name remained established system inspired UNIX long technology faded use
In practice key piece
In large meaning represents state running program process medium storage

Where derivative integral used field Computer Science
What application
This depends mean applying calculus computer science
In comment Quaternary answer make distinction direct indirect application clear exactly distinction making
Following area computer science applicable

Computer algebra system compute integral derivative directly either symbolically numerically blatant example addition software simulates physical system based continuous differential equation computational fluid dynamic necessarily involves computing derivative integral

The behavior combinatorial algorithm large instance often easily analyzed using calculus
This especially true randomized algorithm modern probability theory heavily analytic
In direction sometimes one design algorithm discrete problem considering continuous analogue using calculus solve continuous problem discretizing obtain algorithm original problem
The simplest example might finding approximate root polynomial equation using calculus one formulate Newton method discretize

Sometimes way get handle enumeration problem form generating function use analytic method estimate asymptotic behavior
See book Flajolet Sedgewick
The book analytic combinatorics demonstrates analyze running time algorithm looking pole related complex function
There bunch approximation algorithm approximation ratio rational number
Such number often arrived optimum continuous function limit
The notorious probably arrived surprising number way
The max cut algorithm http also approximation ratio optimum function
Factor revealing LP model worst case instance given size
As instance size go infinity optimal LP solution sometimes approach continuous function
A toy example would Section I sure others one I familiar I coauthor paper
In stochastic simulation often interested estimating expected value random variable
The expected value continuous random variable integral real number
To estimate quantity use Monte Carlo method consists generating instance random variable pseudorandom uniform variable
From uniform variable generate random variable given distribution inverting cumulative distribution function defined integral
Oh hell yes
It used I think used enough

I write script take differential backup directory
Differential backup A differential backup back file changed since last full back
For example suppose full backup Sunday
On Monday back file changed since Sunday Tuesday back file changed since Sunday next full backup
Suppose Example Monday Performed full backup save file set
Thursday Want Perform differential backup using file set
All file changed since full backup backed differential backup
From I require I use script please suggest proceed write script automate
Not asked similar effect pay storage file actually changed Using rsync creating hard link unchanged file
The big advantage snapshot backup right
recovery restore one snapshot instead recovering base increment
There good documentation approach available It worth reading Tower Hanoi incremental backup scheme understanding used
See also And say A Unix example would The use rsync option make command example incremental backup
back directory producing encrypted volume uploading remote local file server
Because duplicity us librsync incremental archive space efficient record part file changed since last backup
Because duplicity us GnuPG encrypt sign archive safe spying modification server
Duplicity implement traditional backup scheme initial archive contains information full backup future changed information added
However advantage may similar solution Easy use Although duplicity utility semantics relative simply
To take basic example command back directory remost host via scp Encrypted signed archive The archive duplicity produce encrypted signed using GnuPG standard free software cryptology
The remote location able infer much backup size uploaded
Also archive modified remote side detected restoring
Bandwidth space efficient Duplicity us rsync algorithm changed part file sent archive incremental backup
For instance long log file increase line text small diff sent saved archive
Other backup program may save complete copy file
Standard file format Although archive data encrypted inside standard format archive
A full backup contains normal tarballs incremental backup tar archive new file delta previous backup
The delta format produced librsync utility rdiff
Although never look duplicity archive manually need arise produced processed using GnuPG rdiff tar
Choice remote protocol Duplicity make many demand archive server
As long file saved read listed deleted location location used duplicity backend
Besides increasing choice user make server secure client require minimal access
Currently local file storage ftp rsync HSI WebDAV Amazon supported others difficult add
There need write script tool exist
SVN GIT You setup svn commit directory
Every time commit save difference
Save Backup case
You go back time restore snapshot previous commits

Are technique use mysqldump similar command make incremental differential backup MySQL
You simulate incremental backup enabling backing binary log
See Making Incremental Backups Enabling Binary Log
Checkout Xtrabackup Percona using InnoDB
It incrementals
Cheers I use binlogs ultimate solution I tend find relying snapshot well
There two primary reason I large number snapshot recently neither compressed differential
I experimented diff found even option context resulting diffs larger
Without trying alternative best thing I found rdiff
This reduced around size compressed xz zone
Although rdiff signature file compress well hash collection random data compressing yield good result
Many people wont need solution case failure need store database recent image bring date quickly possible
However complex system need lot accounting auditing debugging etc critical thing blog efficient storage snapshot becomes important

Another example almost completely derandomized parallel bipartite perfect matching algorithm
This recent result one professor recently published
As computer scientist much care linear algebra
In fact I would encourage taking vector space version
If choose version numerical version take version
It pay long run
It also different covered Calc
Linear algebra immensely useful intend anything computer graphic matrix vector primary mathematical building block graphic

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I added dynamic disk machine
It correctly connected displayed iScsi Initiator correctly binded
However I need reactivate Manage disk console every boot
Is known bug
How I Reactivated automatically please
I issue Buffalo Terastation III iSCSI SAN device connected MS Windows Server
After reboot operating system reactivate dynamic disk associated iSCSI device
And network share associated dynamic disk would lost unshared
iSCSI initiator show device connected okay
The dynamic disk would need activated manually Disk Manager
Then I would reshare folder I wanted shared set share permission
Dynamic disk certain advantage paper make see like good choice Microsoft pulled another undocumented fubar iSCSI device
They reportedly fixed newer MS operating system course pressing motivation go back patch Windows Server OS
This failure reactivate something timing order operation boot process
Disk Management load either soon late dynamic disk activated automatically startup
I discovered scripted solution reactivate affect dynamic disk startup without user intervention using bat file setting startup option Windows Server Group Policy
Reactivating iSCSI dynamic disk setting Group Policy run batch script
The instruction create file configure Group Policy run startup found Note It obvious many Administrators case You need ignore dash Htike Win put front command
He us like bullet character included batch file text file create
Also quote character shown web page smart quote recognized Windows command
You need retype simple quote batch script
Just retype quote character keyboard fine
Optional Finally I added extra line file I added net time c batch file second line
That run diskpart command completes provides simple text log reboot time
It redundancy I build batch script I want able double check running regularly
Next network share set iSCSI drive want another script using net share command reshare resource set permission
You need run AFTER dynamic disk reactivated
I set batch script Each line bat file command reshare particular subfolder
I set share bat file run Group Policy finish
If familiar command run net share
command line see option
You need least assign share name set permission Everyone FULL
You tweak share permission suit cautious restricting permission may lock
Finally I seen reference solving permanently converting Dynamic disk Basic disk I I confirmed SAN manufacturer work fine
The word street Dynamic disk converted Basic reconnect fine reboot network share also get dropped
Something keep mind setting new device future
That next step BuffaloTech support people respond inquiry
Once I get assurance safe convert iSCSI disk Basic mode I arrange time perform full back data I know static hour perform disc conversion
It reported fairly quick process

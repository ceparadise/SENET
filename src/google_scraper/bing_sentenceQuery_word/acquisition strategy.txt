MITRE system engineer SEs expected help sponsor craft realistic robust executable acquisition strategy
This mean helping articulate government need translating need requirement adequately identifying issue risk opportunity shape influence acquisition strategy
MITRE SEs help agency achieve Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR characterizes solicitation
Developing executing effective acquisition strategy requires system thinking ensure various element strategy integrated interdependency understood accounted execution strategy
The acquisition strategy dynamic must reflect change occur execution
Cost schedule system performance capability tradeoff may also required program manager need insight make informed decision based understanding risk involved achieving desired outcome
Therefore system engineering play key role planning executing strategy
How agency acquire product service need perform operation execute mission varies depending criticality urgency product service agency mission
Another factor whether acquisition entail allocation relatively large amount agency resource
Acquisition planning major complex effort requires greater detail formality greater earlier need system engineering
Acquisition management level often requires balancing equity multiple stakeholder establishing executing governance process strike balance desire consensus agility needed make tradeoff among cost schedule capability delivered address changing need priority
Because challenge inherent acquisition economic FAR requires program manager develop document acquisition strategy articulate business technical management concept achieving program objective within imposed resource constraint
MITRE SEs often called help develop execute strategy
Avoid temptation focus contracting aspect acquisition strategy
In many agency term acquisition strategy typically refers contracting aspect acquisition effort
This view tends ignore technical cost influence successful outcome often interdependency must considered determine acquire needed capability
The overall strategy shaped influenced variety factor must considered individually collectively planning executing acquisition effort
The FAR requires program manager develop acquisition strategy tailored particular program
It defines acquisition strategy program manager overall plan satisfying mission need effective economical timely manner
An acquisition strategy required warranted acquisition effort
However acquisition effort MITRE provides system engineering support require acquisition planning written plan acquisition plan documenting ground rule assumption factor guide acquisition effort
For major system acquisition program written documented acquisition strategy may used satisfy FAR requirement acquisition plan
In essence FAR requires federal agency increasingly greater detail formality planning process acquisition complex costly
These major federal acquisition effort also greater need application sound system engineering principle practice within government among supplier industrial base product service
A axiom management program fail beginning
In part attributed inadequate system engineering done effectively articulates government need translates need requirement identifies issue risk opportunity shape influence soundness acquisition strategy
An acquisition strategy typically includes several component part strategy element collectively combine form overall strategy approach acquiring via contract service needed fulfill agency need
These element tend differ depending nature acquisition effort whether effort formally managed program acquisition policy procedure governance policy regulation agency supported
However common element acquisition program strategy structuring program term needed capability developed tested delivered end user
In general two basic approach delivering capability For detail strategy see SEG article
Selecting capability delivery approach use depends several factor including acquired level maturity enabling technology rate technology change stability requirement evolving nature need acquisition effort addressing
For information technology acquisition effort experience shown approach preferred accommodate plan change inherent system
However incorporating evolutionary agile approach delivery capability guarantee acquisition strategy sound
Other factor also determine effectiveness given strategy
These include aspect whether strategy based authoritative assessment risk involved achieving objective acquisition effort realistic test verification strategy meaningful milestone review ass progress toward achieving acquisition objective realistic cost schedule performance delivered capability baseline

Using Reading Strategies Help Computer Science Students Better Understand Technical Material Background I teach computer science student
Thirty tenth grader fifty eleventh grader twelfth grader
Based lack understanding concept procedure necessary write computer program based much repeated complaining frustration expressed I selected fifteen student unsuccessful even much repetition extra time allowance study part teacher research project
Another thirty student initially demonstrated confusion programming understood concept time eventually completed program successfully
They good feeling accomplishment I taught new concept technique would demonstrate confusion lack connectivity
So I included student well project
Research I completed last year led identify reading comprehension key factor determining level success computer science
This year I focused student difficulty understanding concept writing program
First I made effort see reading comprehension score line lack success class I wanted convince understanding textbook computer vocabulary well logical sequencing essential developing well designed program
I discovered successful student reading text chose written problem designed stepping stone yet still able understand new concept technique hearing explain class
It appeared successful student completing book assignment using superior auditory learning skill able learn concept hearing explanation hunting specific code text handout needed
I wanted student chose read textbook due poor reading skill realize using reading strategy would help understand written material therefore would help understand concept programming
Data Collected I collected data reading comprehension score targeted student well successful student
Success based ability quickly understand new concept ability apply new situation
The data still consistent last finding successful student percentile standardized reading comprehension test
The student struggled eventually able grasp make use new concept generally reading comprehension score I observed somewhat totally unsuccessful programming matter I help usually lowest reading comprehension score
I administered student survey I used last year get input student regarding concept topic covered class
I asked indicate seemed difficult topic disliked using found easy use deemed necessary success course
The listed similar student success level The frequently mentioned ability student felt necessary success To ass reading level Computer Science text course I used Fry readability test Edward Fry
Using three different section explained computer I determined readability level ranged fifth tenth grade reading level
Goal My goal use reading strategy help student understand concept needed write efficient program
I focused intervention remediation fifteen student unsuccessful throughout first half school year
Content Area I focused text book chapter covered rounding decimal array matrix structs
Strategies Results Using Cloze Readability formula I determined level success student reading class textbook
I needed determine student unable get meaning reading
The cloze procedure show interplay prior knowledge language competence reader comprehending text material
This strategy involved selecting approximately word text leaving first sentence intact
Starting second sentence I selected random one first five word
I deleted every tenth word leaving underlined space deleted word word word deleted
I retained remaining sentence selection
I gave student cloze reading selection direction Students read selection supply missing word
An example section Cloze reading assignment chapter A function call
This process called recursion call referred recursive call
Recursion programming technique used whenever solved solving one smaller problem combining result
The solve smaller problem
According Fry Cloze Readability Passage direction student scoring regarded reading text competently
A score regarded challenging requiring form reading guidance
A score meant passage probably difficult student would need suitable material
I chose Cloze strategy way get important concept text student reading entire chapter book
My intention expose student text material way would help understand new concept help make use text resource
Students resist filling blank Cloze reading form feel like reading book
It seem efficient way reviewing material focussing important concept
In case reading success level line perception success programming based frustration level time needed figure write program successfully
Two student surprise
One student scored Cloze falling range indicates competence reading text
Yet student usually needed instruction explanation repeated two three time
Because circumstance I surprised well Cloze
I spoke one previous teacher informed severe hearing problem
I informed guidance department student family want special consideration hearing problem
I horrified fact I never knew
I would student sit closer I would understood need repeated oral instruction
Due extenuating circumstance I removed target list student since problem reading text difficulty course involved able hear oral discussion explanation
I able accommodate need better seating arrangement modified way I orally communicated
The student whose score surprised achieved Cloze test successful class
Scores indicated material would probably difficult student yet processed new information quickly immediately able apply new concept programming technique
This student appeared little patience reading assignment written exercise etc
I thought either compensating poor reading ability exceptional listening skill may filled blank Cloze without much serious thought
However I discovered later read material part group presentation read first grade learned read
He often looked attention encouraged laugh class
I later spoke privately asked could read better demonstrated
He said fooling around
I sent data observation guidance counselor asked review record let know evidence reading difficulty
I later informed I made significant discovery
This recent standardized test showed score reading comprehension
Because finding I added otherwise successful student target group
In addition using Cloze form determine student understanding text material Cloze form also became teaching tool get student refer material text using new concept also review material test
Since student liked filling blank I figured I nothing lose student would benefit completion Cloze passage
Many student said helped remember concept forcing use context material order fill missing word
I decided I grade Cloze assignment exact word insertion required using Cloze passage formula determine readability
Since intended learning review strategy rather readability assessment I accepted synonym correct response
I student swap grade paper based judgment
Putting student situation forced look answer defend grading response
Those wrong answer based opinion fast confront classmate eager prove right
I surprised result room full student looking thing text defend answer
I also used Sequence Compare Contrast Cause Effect graphic organizer help student organize sequence step used program
I heard many oohs ahs student saw map order branching program step two program recently completed much agony
I asked thought laying step visually would helped create better program design
They said would helped
After one two assignment used diagram student tried avoid felt I continued show flaw program design would avoided first laid flow entire program began working detail
The following analogy completing task helped student relate diagramming program breaking procedure small manageable task writing program
Everyone said visual diagram would helped realizing I would require diagramming future assignment
I decided student liked complain anything delayed getting keyboard
When I would let anyone turn computer everyone successfully done diagram program student began helping could get computer faster
The successful student appalled step diagram always logically efficiently sequenced
When I explained individually student wrong organization one understood
Soon student actually stopped complaining longer going crazy computer trying rearrange function done without connection without much logical thought
The diagram map saved lot programming time
In addition I student complete writing summary strategy student read array structure Chapter text
I asked every student participate I made big deal using technique increase understanding reading material
As expected many student thought work feel needed
I reminded next week struggled implement array program
I kept reminding never really understood structure willing try understand text instruction
As usual wanted hand learning help needed
I kept trying convince reluctant read interpret material textbook would better understand structure code would able use program
Finally I used strategy student list term code category heading I gave
I followed make Venn diagram show term related one category
I used strategy often Geometry class never thought Computer Science
I provided term heading assignment
I designed lesson student selected word section text came category heading
Then I gave test consisting heading come least five term put category
They appeared like type work
Once consider reading
So I tell using reading comprehension strategy
Implications future teaching I planning use Visual Essay technique near future
I give student completed Visual Essay consisting function heading line instruction program scrambled order
They cut put correct order create successful program
All I tell task program
There visual cue punctuation used
In half visual essay I leave internal program documentation comment explain purpose task function
I want prove without appropriate documentation someone else know program supposed accomplish
I expect essay comment done others
I anxious see result
Conclusions After I evaluated readability level Computer Science text individual ability understand concept text I explained great detail I done I determined
When student became aware learning process resist effort help reading strategy
They actually needed reason reading writing assignment
Up point viewed reading writing assignment busy work served purpose
As long reading writing assignment kept short provided opportunity student interaction student view assignment enjoyed
I fewer instance frustrated outburst student I also noticed student asked specific question could
They could better organize step program longer complaining They thinking learning process taking time follow problem solving strategy George Polya eminent mathematician spent much career emphasizing method rule discovery invention well strategy stripping away irrelevancy going straight heart problem
Princeton Science Library Abstract
Using strategy student would The combination graphic organizer reading strategy provided student powerful learning tool
Through finding teacher research project I learned using reading strategy truly helped student grasp concept necessary computer programming
I introduce reading strategy student beginning next school year hope achieving greater success le frustration student throughout year

An interesting discussion myriad method startup may choose acquire data often overlooked important aspect startup success failure

The unreasonable effectiveness data application widely debated year see
It also suggested many major breakthrough field Artificial Intelligence constrained algorithmic advance availability datasets see
The common thread running discussion data vital component machine learning
Access training data critical startup use machine learning core technology business
While many algorithm software tool open sourced shared across research community good datasets usually proprietary hard build
Owning large dataset therefore become significant source competitive advantage especially startup jumpstart situation user data smarter algorithm better product user
Consequently one key strategic decision machine learning startup make build datasets train learning algorithm
Unfortunately startup often limited labeled data beginning situation precludes founder making significant progress building product
It therefore worth exploring data acquisition strategy outset hiring data science team building costly core infrastructure
Startups overcome data acquisition numerous way
The choice data usually go choice business model startup focus consumer enterprise horizontal vertical etc
funding situation
The following list strategy neither exhaustive mutually exclusive give sense broad range approach available
Building good proprietary dataset scratch almost always mean putting lot human effort data acquisition performing manual task scale
Examples startup used brute force beginning plentiful
For instance many chatbot startup employ human manually create verify prediction virtual agent make varying degree success high employee turnover rate
Even tech giant resort strategy response reviewed edited team contractor
Using brute force manually label data point successful strategy long data network effect kick point human longer scale equal pace customer base
As soon AI system improving fast enough unspecified outlier become le frequent number human perform manual labeling decreased held constant
Interesting More le every machine learning startup Examples Most startup try collect data directly user
The challenge convince early adopter use product benefit machine learning fully kick data needed first place train algorithm
One way around drastically narrow problem domain expand scope later needed
As Chris Dixon say The amount data need relative breadth problem trying Good example benefit narrow domain chatbots
Startups segment choose two strategy They build bot help large number question immediate request example
Or create bot try perform one specific job extremely well example recently
While approach valid data collection dramatically easier startup tackle problem
Interesting Vertically integrated business Examples Instead using qualified employee intern manually collect label data startup also crowdsource process
Platforms like offer way clean messy incomplete data using online workforce million people
For example acquired Apple used Amazon Mechanical Turk feed digital assistant thousand user query
Workers also outsourced employing independent contractor done
The necessary condition using approach task clearly explained
Another tactic incentivize public voluntarily contribute data
An example AI startup us approach get hand certain type data confirmation email restaurant hotel airline
Like startup Snips us gamified system user ranked leaderboard
Interesting Use case quality control easily enforced Examples A crowdsourcing strategy deserves category This approach involves designing product provide right incentive user give data back system
Two classic example company used approach many product autocomplete search Google Translate spam filter etc
user tagging friend photo
Users often unaware provide company labeled data free
Many startup machine learning space drawn inspiration Google Facebook creating product UX explicitly encourage user correct machine error
Particularly notable founded Luis von Ahn
Other example include
Interesting startup constant user interaction Examples A strategy seems particularly popular among computer vision startup offer free mobile app target consumer
acquired Twitter pursued strategy offering photo apps gather additional image data core business
This strategy completely without risk cost time money successfully develop promote app
Startups must also ensure create strong enough use case compels user give data even service lack benefit data network effect beginning

Student learning depth student knowledge increase active learning method employed classroom
Active learning strategy discussed general computer science course work used theory computation course
Difficulties active learning technique dealing also presented
Active learning get student involved activity classroom rather passively listening lecture
This activity reading writing discussing solving problem responding question require factual answer
The idea get student thinking material
This important student passive decline concentration minute minute lecture act learning passive
As faculty learn actively
In preparing lecture note read compare read experience synthesize information coherent note develop example illustrate concept
This lead greater understanding material
Unfortunately use understanding lecture student depriving journey discovery
By carefully involving student path knowledge increase student depth understanding material increase student comfort material improve student confidence
In science value active learning already realized implemented laboratory computer science programming project
The idea present expand include activity classroom replace part lecture
If active learning successful used frequently
This perception active learning higher risk
There fear content taken put active learning preparation time higher active learning appropriate large class
Perhaps largest fear giving control classroom lecture let professor decide say student centered activity may raise question professor planning discus
These fear real surmountable
To cover content give student responsibility learning factual material apply classroom discussion
I student write course evaluation need read book class lecture would tell needed know chapter
If student believe hear lecture similar text material willing read text
For faculty class note year year developing active learning strategy take time pulling note filing cabinet
In field rapidly changing computer science note need done frequently enough great concern
Further develop idea active learning find applied across number different course
Active learning strategy allow control level risk
By selecting short highly structured activity level risk fairly low
Involving student asking series question current topic allows teacher control direction content discussion still make student active
Breaking student small group letting independently solve problem much higher risk prove highly rewarding
As mentioned strategy active learning equally valid many computer science course
This section describe generic technique active learning computer science
The next section show application technique theory computation course
As mentioned student attention begin decline minute lecture
Further lecture something catch attention causing u miss part next point
A strategy handle lecture minute take minute break
During break student discus note person next filling gap correcting misunderstanding
Alternatively activity lead discussion would pose question employ technique
In technique question posed student individually write answer within one two minute time limit
Each student pair person next discus answer possibly developing new one
The instructor start discussion next lecture topic asking pair share answer class
In computer science class could pose question like What happen I change input
What could happen I include conditional check
Why important reduce number operation sorting algorithm
Why four condition necessary deadlock occur If professor computer classroom question relate structure algorithm behavior answer tested real time
Even better student computer hand group get together try solution
In later case instructor must careful student think answer first activity degrade hacking session
Instead tracing execution algorithm lecture break student group trace algorithm
For example compare sorting algorithm break class group four student
Assign one student algorithm tracer one keep track variable value another record number performed last record change list
By providing team transparency marker team easily display answer rest class
By running implementation algorithm group result quickly compared actual answer In classroom projection unit connected computer system running demonstration software professor powerful tool student interact idea computer science
By dividing student group ask predict happen output based change input set also allows student formulate question trying understand idea
For example student trying understand nature recursive algorithm see effect input large amount software type developed number area computer science
This readily available internet
Role playing powerful tool computer science classroom
To student understand network protocol could class passing ball around discussion letting student talk ball
Students experience first hand operation Token Passing Protocols
Similar activity could used simulate flow information circuit student chip passing information back forth execution parallel algorithm group different part simultaneously recently used activity type illustrate concept object class introductory programming class
In class I used paper bag represent object private data inside bag
Students class given code fragment representing class method well main program used class
We executed code constructor function getting new bag object create bag object moving around room opened class method
This clearly illustrated student action class method relationship method private data
I teaching theory computation number year upper undergraduate level sophomore year
Our student taken theory computation first semester sophomore year completed one semester computer science overview course
They take hour C programming course concurrently theory computation
The purpose theory course introduce student finite state machine regular expression grammar Turing Machines limit computing
At sophomore level course practically oriented proof past three offering course I used three different teaching style
For Fall course taught typical lecture style presentation
Students regular homework assignment took three semester exam final Fall course different look
Students assigned group three static entire semester
For information using group work see
Class time broken two minute followed minute group problem solving exercise classroom
One group would present solution class
There regular homework assignment done group
These exercise homework taken directly problem text
Students still took three semester exam individually group also reworked exam weekend turned group solution
So student took exam twice alone Fall course became combination two previous offering
Because fear group working effectively enough learn material classroom became closer lecture hall
I keep active learning asking question lead student solving problem
However student longer group exercise classroom though continued work homework exam group outside class
When I decided implement active learning class I wanted way checking see benefit student
The active learning literature example said would positive effect I wanted test
There numerous study large student population show positive influence student grade active learning employed
Even though class small I wanted test see I would find similar I distribute copy final exam since cumulative entire semester I thought could mechanism test student done various technique
So three semester mentioned I used exact final exam
I also collected information grade point average GPA college level course work student completed starting course
There student transferred institution institution
They excluded study reliable grade point average information avoid difference grading scheme likely exam graded three year period exam duplicated regraded
Exams three class mixed together regrading help eliminate unconscious biasing result
Further I developed five point scale question used take difference point level different question
The general meaning point value given table
After excluding transfer student established GPA sample student involved study small Fall Fall Fall
The result ANOVA single factor analysis class GPA class exam score showed significant difference GPAs student three class significant difference exam score table
Students class Fall many Fall active learning technique used performed better final exam
In order ass strength effect variable correlation matrix calculated
Since exam score second year higher third class renumbered correlation variable Fall Fall Fall
The correlation GPA final exam score p
The correlation GPA class indicates independence GPA class assignment
The correlation class exam score p
Thus correlation class exam score confounded assignment student different GPAs different summary student sample three offering course significantly differ ability base entering GPA
This important expected result show student higher GPAs perform better exam
Since class similar GPA distribution difference student ability could skewed result
The important point however student course active learning better
Further addition significant group activity classroom Fall Fall seemed help much le noticeable amount
Based experience I appreciate need balance instructor presentation student activity
It seems lecture necessary discus thing instructor view critical difficult understand
It also important however activity get student active active learning technique risky faculty risk minimized choosing short well structured activity
As comfort level active learning increase riskier strategy tried
Though loss control scary first I found invigorated look forward challenge active reality today higher education United States student seem interested learning
By employing active learning strategy student learn content process well
This make better student later course better professional finishing degree
I would like thank Frank Dinan support effort active learning
I would also like thank Fred Dansereau help statistical analysis result

The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis

I using algorithm solve binary classification problem
classification
I using based algorithm particular
When I get classification result sometimes probability estimation result pretty low
For example I get classification probability kind result I rather throw away maybe classify
Just clear output classification I also get confidence level
For example If I weather guy I reporting tomorrow raining I positive forecast
In case I sure wo take umbrella leave home tomorrow right
So case model high confidence level I throw away prediction count estimation
Unfortunately I ca find article regarding thresholding probability estimation
Does anyone idea normal threshold I set probability estimation
least refer article
There universal answer
Instead depends application
What count useful
That determines count useful machine learning algorithm
What count useful vary widely application application application require accuracy others might happy accuracy
In practice also multiple way define accuracy
If expect ground truth half object classified half obvious accuracy measure suffices counting fraction instance classifier output correct answer
However object lot common object penalty object different penalty object might want measure accuracy differently
The best measure accuracy single universal answer
If method reasonable correlation confidence accuracy rate confidence higher accuracy
Then get sample true distribution use gold standard
Now study mentioned correlation
What threshold confidence start lose accuracy
For class gain G getting prediction correct loss L getting prediction wrong
You solve probability p using equation Gp L get p confidence scored
G p
Each class different threshold

get name happens branch statistic
Rather simply describe set data inferential statistic seek infer something population basis
One specific goal inferential statistic involves determination value unknown population
The range value use estimate parameter called confidence interval
A confidence interval consists two part
The first part estimate population parameter
We obtain estimate using
From sample calculate statistic corresponds parameter wish estimate
For example interested mean height student United States would use simple random sample first grader measure compute mean height sample
The second part confidence interval margin error
This necessary estimate alone may different true value population parameter
In order allow potential value parameter need produce range number
The margin error
Thus every confidence interval following form Estimate Margin Error The estimate center interval subtract add margin error estimate obtain range value parameter
Attached every confidence interval level confidence
This probability percent indicates much certainty attributed confidence interval
If aspect situation identical higher confidence level wider confidence interval
This level confidence
It statement sampling procedure population
Instead giving indication success process construction confidence interval
For example confidence interval confidence long run miss true population parameter one every five time
Any number zero one could theory used confidence level
In practice common confidence level
The margin error confidence level determined couple factor
We see examining formula margin error
A margin error form Margin Error Statistic Confidence Level Standard The statistic confidence level depends upon used level confidence chosen
For example confidence level working area curve
This number number margin error formula
The term necessary margin error standard deviation standard error
The standard deviation distribution working preferred
However typically parameter population unknown
This number usually available forming confidence interval practice
To deal uncertainty knowing standard deviation instead use standard error
The standard error corresponds standard deviation estimate standard deviation
What make standard error powerful calculated simple random sample used calculate estimate
No extra information necessary sample estimation u
There variety different situation call confidence interval
These confidence interval used estimate number different parameter
Although aspect different confidence interval united overall format
Some common confidence interval population mean population variance population proportion difference two population mean difference two population proportion
There error

John Regehr Professor Computer Science University Utah USA Many computer scientist including end research need evaluated experimentally yet u little training statistic design experiment
We end teaching material go often work pretty well
On hand sometimes issue surprisingly subtle
Today piece example I found case I ran across year ago sanity check confidence interval code giving answer seemed make sense
The topic confidence interval binomial proportion take series independent measurement use compute interval likely contains true proportion
For example flip coin time get head time conclude coin biased towards head
In word confidence interval proportion head exclude
In case interval contain data support conclusion coin unfair level
If reach conclusion confidence actually mean
Informally mean repeated entire experiment case coin flip many time would reach correct conclusion time
The time would incorrect
Statisticians formalize proportion time interval contains true value At point u would ask Doesn confidence interval coverage probability definition
Turns answer fun start
Let take example n sample size p true proportion
We empirically compute coverage confidence interval repeatedly taking random sample seeing true proportion lie within confidence interval
For use normal approximation binomial

Compile run like As see coverage mean although asked probability error actually getting chance pretty significant difference
There couple thing going
One problem normal approximation good one
In particular recommended np n le
Here however pas test
Other source give le conservative test np n required lead coverage small
The unfortunate thing many stats class including one I took many year ago also book ubiquitous go beyond presenting normal guess simple
However use approximation follow np rule aim confidence interval could easily end publishing result even significant level
Many statistician recommend avoiding normal approximation altogether
But used instead
The fully conservative guaranteed never le coverage asked
However often overly conservative might getting confidence wanted
What wrong
First may lead waste time running unnecessary experiment
Second may cause reject hypothesis actually hold desired level confidence
In work last several year I used
It hardly difficult implement normal approximation better behavior small np
Also work
The interval also many good characteristic
short easy read I recommend people interested learning issue
A exhaustive exhausting discussion found paper
Earlier I alluded fact normal approximation one problem creating confidence interval binomial proportion
The problem approximation including exact since binomial distribution discrete possible general make actual coverage probability nominal coverage probability
The relationship nominal actual coverage probability interesting observe
The following graph produced using C program show behavior normal approximation confidence interval n bound I wrote piece difference nominal actual coverage probability statistician seem communicated effectively practicing scientist
In ideal world detail matter much people like would simply rely convenient R library confidence interval computation library would designed vetted expert
In practice solution probably optimal anyway I always seem end confidence interval code embedded various I spent fair amount time trying learn underlying issue order avoid screwing
Ignore probably learned confidence interval proportion college
Use interval Wilson score interval
Nice
This sort content exactly I hoping Evaluate effort though still early day
Another related statistical topic experimental people least I run inappropriate use certain statistical model comparing mean data uniformly distributed
My experimental data benchmark run tends either I resort different test gain confidence whether optimization actually helped harmed left benchmark alone
I sure reviewer really cared unfortunately
In Social science something like probability dataset normal distribution also lot error analysis assumes normal distribution irrespective underlying distribution analysis simpler
past stats book aimed social science distribution readily available normal distribution
These coincidence combined lead use normal everything approach
These day rely precomputed table let computer work
I working book empirical software engineering one question I trying answer What common distribution software engineering The normal distribution rare datasets I exponential common negative binomial popular place
I looked whether measurement error normally distributed
Incidentally plot spiky
In fact even spike end look right
From description I expecting line present
Hi Lars I seen Evaluate project thanks pointing
Raising bar statistical analysis software system good thing
As point moment one count reviewer appreciate good job
On hand I think skepticism statistical method useful
Using example compiler optimization real danger I awesome job stats miss fact effect totally due quirk Linux scheduler cache setup random CPU
In word awesome stats mostly needed effect small people rightfully mistrust result computer system effect small since likely portable system
Hi Derek I attempted understand reason funny shape plot
However I fairly confident correct check code want
The character plot similar see paper topic two article link
In addition using good confidence interval I would suggest prefer order statistic possible robust
That use median rather mean
One advantage exact confidence interval order statistic depend underlying distribution
Assume measured p independent experiment received order value
Then could publish median probability
Also know probability true median probability lie
This true independent underlying distribution need know p probability binomial distribution need Gaussian approximation
Other people explain much better I please refer Le Boudec book performance evaluation R mailing list
In hindsight I realize I proposed solution slightly different problem quantiles probably applicable experiment binary outcome one describing
They remain valuable tool type experiment though

method discovering interesting relation variable large database
It intended identify strong rule discovered database using measure interestingness
Based concept strong rule Arun Swami introduced association rule discovering regularity product transaction data recorded POS system supermarket
For example rule found sale data supermarket would indicate customer buy onion potato together likely also buy hamburger meat
Such information used basis decision marketing activity promotional
In addition example association rule employed today many application area including
In contrast association rule learning typically consider order item either within transaction across transaction
Following original definition Agrawal Imieliński Swami problem association rule mining defined Let set binary attribute called
Let set transaction called
Each unique transaction ID contains subset item
A defined implication form
In Agrawal Imieliński Swami defined set single item
Every rule composed two different set item also known called LHS RHS
To illustrate concept use small example supermarket domain
The set item table shown small database containing item entry value mean presence item corresponding transaction value represents absence item transaction
An example rule supermarket could meaning butter bread bought customer also buy milk
Note example extremely small
In practical application rule need support several hundred transaction considered statistically significant datasets often contain thousand million transaction
In order select interesting rule set possible rule constraint various measure significance interest used
The constraint minimum threshold support confidence
Let itemset association rule set transaction given database
Support indication frequently itemset appears dataset
The support respect defined proportion transaction dataset contains itemset
In example dataset itemset support since occurs transaction transaction
The argument set precondition thus becomes restrictive grows instead inclusive
Confidence indication often rule found true
The value rule respect set transaction proportion transaction contains also contains
Confidence defined For example rule confidence database mean transaction containing butter bread rule correct time customer buy butter bread milk bought well
Note mean support union item X Y
This somewhat confusing since normally think term probability set item
We rewrite probability event transaction contains itemset respectively
Thus confidence interpreted estimate conditional probability probability finding RHS rule transaction condition transaction also contain LHS
The rule defined ratio observed support expected X Y
For example rule lift
If rule lift would imply probability occurrence antecedent consequent independent
When two event independent rule drawn involving two event
If lift let u know degree two occurrence dependent one another make rule potentially useful predicting consequent future data set
The value lift considers confidence rule overall data set
The rule defined
For example rule conviction interpreted ratio expected frequency X occurs without Y say frequency rule make incorrect prediction X Y independent divided observed frequency incorrect prediction
In example conviction value show rule would correct often time often association X Y purely random chance
Association rule usually required satisfy minimum support minimum confidence time
Association rule generation usually split two separate step While second step straightforward first step need attention
Finding frequent itemsets database difficult since involves searching possible itemsets item combination
The set possible itemsets size excluding empty set valid itemset
Although size grows exponentially number item efficient search possible using support also called guarantee frequent itemset subset also frequent thus infrequent itemset subset frequent itemset
Exploiting property efficient algorithm Apriori Eclat find frequent itemsets
The concept association rule popularised particularly due article Agrawal et acquired citation according Google Scholar August thus one cited paper Data Mining field
However possible called association rule similar appears paper GUHA general data mining method developed et al
An early circa use minimum support confidence find association rule Feature Based Modeling framework found rule greater user defined constraint
In addition confidence measure rule proposed
Some popular measure Several measure presented compared Tan et al
Hahsler
Looking technique model user known using model interestingness measure currently active research trend name Subjective Interestingness
One limitation standard approach discovering association searching massive number possible association look collection item appear associated large risk finding many spurious association
These collection item unexpected frequency data chance
For example suppose considering collection item looking rule containing two item item
There approximately rule
If apply statistical test independence significance level mean chance accepting rule association
If assume association nonetheless expect find rule
Statistically sound association discovery control risk case reducing risk finding spurious association significance level
Many algorithm generating association rule proposed
Some algorithm Eclat half job since algorithm mining frequent itemsets
Another step need done generate rule frequent itemsets found database
Apriori us search strategy count support itemsets us candidate generation function exploit downward closure property support

FP stand frequent pattern
In first pas algorithm count occurrence item pair dataset store table
In second pas build structure inserting instance
Items instance sorted descending order frequency dataset tree processed quickly
Items instance meet minimum coverage threshold discarded
If many instance share frequent item provides high compression close tree root
Recursive processing compressed version main dataset grows large item set directly instead generating candidate item testing entire database
Growth start bottom header table longest branch finding instance matching given condition
New tree created count projected original tree corresponding set instance conditional attribute node getting sum child count
Recursive growth end individual item conditional attribute meet minimum support threshold processing continues remaining header item original
Once recursive process completed large item set minimum coverage found association rule creation begin
AprioriDP utilizes Frequent itemset mining
The working principle eliminate candidate generation like store support count specialized data structure instead tree
CBPNARM algorithm developed mine association rule basis context
It us context variable basis support itemset changed basis rule finally populated rule set
FIN PrePost PPV three algorithm based node set
They use node coding represent itemsets employ search strategy discovery frequent itemsets using intersection node set
general method exploratory data analysis theoretical foundation
The ASSOC procedure GUHA method mine generalized association rule using fast operation
The association rule mined method general output apriori example item connected conjunction disjunction relation antecedent consequent rule restricted setting minimum support confidence apriori arbitrary combination supported interest measure used
OPUS efficient algorithm rule discovery contrast alternative require either monotone constraint minimum support
Initially used find rule fixed consequent subsequently extended find rule item consequent
OPUS search core technology popular Magnum Opus association discovery system
A famous story association rule mining beer diaper story
A purported survey behavior supermarket shopper discovered customer presumably young men buy diaper tend also buy beer
This anecdote became popular example unexpected association rule might found everyday data
There varying opinion much story true
Daniel Powers say In Thomas Blischok manager retail consulting group staff prepared analysis million market basket Osco Drug store
Database query developed identify affinity
The analysis discover consumer bought beer diaper
Osco manager NOT exploit beer diaper relationship moving product closer together shelf

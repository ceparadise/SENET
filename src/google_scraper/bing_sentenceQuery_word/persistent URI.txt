Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I read page I know basic URL URN URI little
The thing I ca understand page like part URL URN URI
URI whole part URL URN
Picture wikipedia An URL type URI identifies resource via representation primary access mechanism network location rather attribute may
It considered incorrect use URL describing application
Now attribute
What application part
Is PHP application
Contains information fetch resource location
For example URLs always start protocol usually contain information network host name often document path
URLs may query parameter fragment identifier
Identifies resource unique persistent name
It usually start prefix For example URNs identify idea concept
They restricted identifying document
When URN represent document translated URL resolver
The document downloaded URL
URIs encompass URLs URNs way identify resource
An example URI neither URL URN would
It URL URN URI contains data
It neither name tell locate network
There also uniform resource citation URCs point meta data document rather document
An example URC would identifier viewing source code web page
A URC another type URI neither URL URN
The spec HTML say contain URI URL
You able put URN
Your browser would resolve URN URL download book
Not I know modern web browser implement data URI scheme
No
Both relative absolute URLs URLs URIs
No
Both URLs without query parameter URLs URIs
No
Both URLs without fragment identifier URLs URIs
Yes
The realized ton confusion
They issued say OK use term URL URI interchangeably mean URI
It longer useful strictly segment URIs different type URL URN URC
The definition URN looser I stated
The say URI URN regardless whether start long property name
That It globally unique persistent even resource cease exist becomes unavailable
An example The URIs used HTML doctypes
That URI would continue name transitional doctype even page website deleted
I think article explain quite well
To answer question URL Each bit name I see given diagram wikipedia asking though
That diagram saying two type URI URLs URNs fuzzy bit middle something
It case URL mention composed URL URN part
URL URI
Basically URIs superset URLs URNs
There overlap URLs URNs well
A URI identifies resource either location name
So URL URI URN URI every URI URL
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Put aside Object Oriented XML paradigm
Two alternative Do NOT confuse URI thing URI web page
Each URI identifies one thing See also TAG finding Be part Semantic See Jim Melton Tech Plenary talk

A URI Uniform Resource Identifier sequence character identifies logical physical resource
Universal Resource Identifiers specified Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Request Comments RFC summarized extended documentation Web Architecture Architecture World Wide Web Volume
According specification resource accessible Internet
Examples resource include electronic document elevator door sensor web page ID microchip pet

There two type URIs Uniform Resource Identifiers Uniform Resource Names
type URI begin stating protocol used locate access physical logical resource network
If resource web page example URI begin protocol HTTP
If resource file URI begin protocol resource email address URI begin protocol mailto
It important remember URLs persistent
This mean resource location change URL also need change point resource new location
type URI state protocol used locate access resource simply label resource persistent
A URN identify resource throughout lifecycle never change
Each URN three component label urn colon character string serf unique identifier
The generic form URI The scheme lay concrete syntax associated protocol URI
Schemes followed colon
Ideally URI scheme registered Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA although nonregistered scheme also used
While two slash shown example required scheme required scheme including authority component described
An authority component made multiple part optional authentication section host consisting either registered name IP address optional port number
The authentication section contains username password separated colon followed symbol
After come hostname turn followed colon port number
It important note address must notation address must enclosed bracket
The path contains data notated sequence segment separated slash
The path must begin single slash authority part present
It may also begin single slash even authority part begin double slash
Keep mind part syntax may closely resemble particular file path always imply relation file system path
The query contains string nonhierarchical data
Although syntax often sequence attribute value pair separated delimiter ampersand semicolon
The query separated preceding part question mark
The fragment contains fragment identifier provides direction secondary resource
For example primary resource HTML document fragment often ID attribute specific element document
If fragment identifies certain section article identified rest URI Web browser scroll particular element view
The fragment separated preceding part hash
URI resolution one common operation performed URIs also URLs
It involves determining proper data access method parameter needed locate retrieve resource URI point
A used determine common usage URI
A URI reference may take form full URI specific portion full URI empty string
If fragment identifier identify portion resource referred rest URI
A URI also known relative reference
A URI relative reference prefix match syntax scheme followed colon separator
In order determine component present whether reference relative five URI component parsed subpart validation

A URN may compared person name URL may compared street address
In word URN identifies item URL provides method finding
A URL URI addition identifying web resource specifies mean acting upon obtaining representation

For example URL refers resource identified whose representation form related code obtainable via network host whose
A URN URI identifies resource name particular namespace
A URN may used talk resource without implying location access

To gain access book location needed URL would specified
Technical publication especially standard produced normally reflect view outlined acknowledges precedence term URI rather endorsing formal subdivision URL URN
A URL simply URI happens point resource network
However context software World Wide Web term remains widely used
Additionally term formal definition often occurs publication synonym URI us scheme
Such assumption lead confusion example case XML namespaces
While URI scheme originally designed used particular often name semantically different protocol
For example scheme generally used interacting using HTTP scheme protocol
The syntax generic URIs absolute URI reference first defined published August finalized RFC published January
A generic URI form It comprises Strings data within URI represented character
Permitted character within URI character lowercase uppercase letter modern
Octets represented character must
Of ASCII character set character reserved use delimiters generic URI component must example question mark
The character permitted generic URI syntax used unencoded user information host path delimiters
Additionally may appear unencoded within path query fragment may appear unencoded data within query fragment
The following figure display two example URIs component part
A URI reference may take form full URI portion full URI trailing component full URI empty string
An optional preceded may present end URI reference
The part reference indirectly identifies resource fragment identifier identifies portion resource
To derive URI URI reference software convert URI reference form merging URI according fixed algorithm
The system treat URI reference relative base URI although case absolute reference base relevance
If base URI includes fragment identifier ignored merging process
If fragment identifier present URI reference preserved merging process
Web document frequently use URI reference point resource external document specific portion logical document
To URI mean either convert relative URI reference absolute form URI URI reference attempting obtain representation resource identifies
A URI reference document containing URI reference
A URI reference defined reference resolved absolute form equates exactly base URI effect reference
When encountering reference document processing software example web browser efficiently use current representation document satisfy resolution reference document without fetching new representation
defined URI reference identical base URI still represents resource
URIs URLs shared history
In proposal implicitly introduced idea URL short string representing resource target
At time people referred hypertext name document name
Over next three half year World Wide Web core technology HTML HTTP web browser developed need distinguish string provided address resource string merely named resource emerged
Although yet formally defined term came represent former contentious came represent latter
During debate defining URLs URNs became evident two concept embodied term merely aspect fundamental overarching notion resource
In June IETF published RFC first Request Comments acknowledged existence URLs URNs importantly defined formal syntax string whose precise syntax semantics depended scheme
In addition RFC attempted summarize syntax URL scheme use time
It also acknowledged standardize existence relative URLs fragment identifier
In December RFC formally defined relative absolute URLs refined general URL syntax defined resolve relative URLs absolute form better enumerated URL scheme use
The agreed definition syntax URNs wait publication RFC May
The publication RFC August saw URI syntax become separate specification part RFCs relating URIs URLs general revised expanded
The new RFC changed meaning U URI Uniform Universal
In December RFC provided minor update RFC allowing URIs accommodate address
A number shortcoming discovered two specification led community effort coordinated RFC culminated publication RFC January
While obsoleting prior standard render detail existing URL scheme obsolete RFC continues govern scheme except otherwise superseded
RFC example refines scheme
Simultaneously IETF published content RFC full standard STD reflecting establishment URI generic syntax official Internet protocol
In Technical Architecture Group TAG published guide canonical URIs publishing multiple version given resource
For example content might differ language size adjust capacity setting device used access content
In August RFC pointed term URL despite widespread public use faded near obsolescence serf reminder URIs act address scheme implying network accessibility regardless actual use
As standard make evident resource identification need suggest retrieval resource representation Internet need imply resource
The us HTTP URI scheme identify document concept real world distinction caused confusion distinguish two
The TAG published solve problem became known

In abstract domain collection element attribute name assigned
The namespace name character string must adhere generic URI syntax
However name generally considered URI URI specification base decision lexical component also intended use
A namespace name necessarily imply semantics URI scheme example namespace name beginning may connotation use
Originally namespace name could match syntax URI reference use relative URI reference deprecated
A separate specification namespaces XML permit reference serve basis namespace name addition URI reference

ABSTRACT Commercial COTS application software available end user
These include licensed shareware freeware software commercial support
The use COTS application increased recent time due reduced cost development time
Since third party software generally developed poor documentation le security consideration use critical system pose security threat
This paper review literature work done past detection malicious code COTS application
It lay foundation selecting best technique securing COTS application
This work mainly focus current trend COTS application coping security issue
Keywords COTS Security Static Analysis Dynamic Analysis Malicious code detection Intrusion Tolerance
Information technology inclined new system however different phase design development testing security sophisticated task
Building new COTS system requires substantial time skill
Generally organization rely software already installed rather opting custom application
These trusted software make large percentage total software system passage time new system become trusted
Building new system securely crucial important even difficult secure old system
A system may run securely many year guarantee system secure
In today acirc integrated IT environment system made large number hardware system software application software component
Vulnerabilities component generally introduced upgrade new feature added
Exploitation vulnerability component may result data loss even system compromise
Enforcing security COTS application somewhat different difficult custom software
The custom software build organization developer outsourced
The organization owner responsible ensuring security custom software
In case COTS component exception open source software source code generally available
The end user little control software
The security COTS application responsibility vendor
Since organization owner application user ensure security COTS application
COTS application vulnerable different type threat follows Malicious code general term used segment code within software system intention cause undesirable effect like damaging data system
Malicious code includes virus worm Trojan Horses coding error etc
Backdoor way gaining unauthorized access online program computer system without detected
Backdoors divided three type
System backdoor used gain unauthorized access data system level
Application backdoor used exploit weakness particular application
Crypto backdoor flaw inserted cryptosystem developer special purpose attacker use convert cipher text plain text
Time bomb undesirable piece code within software executed particular time reached
In order mitigate affect malicious code COTS application number technique available
The detail technique follows Static analysis method detecting malicious behavior within program without running
Dynamic analysis used analyze program look suspicious activity program executing
In technique compiler besides converting source code machine code also check source code malicious behavior certain security specification
In intrusion tolerance technique security addressed COTS component way continue function normally even attacked someone
In paper discussed different security issue related COTS application like vulnerability assessment malicious code detection etc
Next presented different security architecture COTS application analyzed various technique available detection isolation malicious code
COTS component generally used large scale mainly provide abstraction reusability code reduced development time
Besides benefit relying COTS component build secure system risky
COTS application mainly available without guarantee application function case becomes worse source code available
Generally security issue arise COTS application due integration component
So method required analyze COTS application security purpose
The paper presented importance COTS component COTS prone security risk
A case study regarding security risk Java discussed
The study show even Java build security mind vulnerable different type attack would security level general COTS application
The strength paper presented different method developer test COTS component security integration large system
The weakness testing method suggested paper general purpose real technique detection malicious code COTS application
COTS application may subject malicious activity like virus Trojan horse attack largely due reusability code segment
The vulnerable code might inserted program segment either intentionally unintentionally
The programmer create backdoor loophole intentionally COTS application remote monitoring testing purpose
The unintentional insertion generally called program bug due coding error race condition program segment
Since malicious code embedded COTS application even completion program development either distribution installation continuous monitoring system required detection malicious behavior
The author discussed three type analysis manual source code analysis analysis analysis malicious code detection trusted software
The strength paper provides comprehensive material detailed step performing manual analysis COTS application malicious behavior detection
It also give tabular comparison among three analysis type
The paper also suggests property tool developed malicious code detection COTS system
The weak point paper contains quite unnecessary material like description generally known term like virus worm backdoor Trojan horse etc
Secondly paper discussed different analysis technique suggest one better
With large scale usage COTS application vulnerability assessment software become major concern especially organization relying software
Generally security COTS component calculated economic basis
Most currently available vulnerability rating system rate confidentiality integrity availability CIA equally
Therefore model required analyze correct vulnerability rating
Another paper Yen Chen Barry Boehm proposed Threat Modeling method dynamically rank COTS vulnerability based Attacking Path Analysis TPA
The strength paper first automated framework us user consideration effectively evaluate vulnerability respect value
With COTS security assessed early system
Limitation paper evaluate known vulnerability
COTS component different custom software secure system built unsecured COTS component
With rapid upgrade COTS system new vulnerability introduced
Therefore traditional modeling applied custom software used
Since vulnerability introduced COTS component mainly upgrade model vulnerability detection COTS component required
Tom Markham Dwight Colby Mary Denz introduced security modeling COTS application based many feature currently available model
The good point model us object oriented approach allows active analysis distributed system rather static analysis
The model require COTS source code specification implementation
The model allows adding new component existing COTS system without reanalyzing whole system
The drawback model clear method suggested populating model component library secondly model show compare vulnerability COTS vulnerability database
Large number COTS application used distributed system mainly due low cost component
One drawback COTS system usually security consideration met final stage development
Since COTS component little security service available used build secure distributed system
To address security consideration COTS system architecture required
In author proposed security architecture COTS based distributed system
The architecture four step
In first step software security analysis used identify potential threat COTS component
The second step definition security policy
Next step choosing secure COTS component based minimum threat level
The last step testing efficiency system
The good point paper author implemented proposed architecture two different COTS system
Secondly paper showed impact addition new COTS component overall system
The drawback paper implementation generalized specific two COTS system test conducted
Many organization switching custom software COTS based system
This shifting pose threat term security reliability confidentiality integrity COTS system
Since COTS system consist diverse component liable malicious activity
Therefore detect malicious behavior COTS component mechanism required
The author presented structured approach detection malicious behavior COTS application static slicing binary code
The model consists code analysis level detection process level
In code analysis phase binary code disassembled converted high level form
In detection phase code divided segment checked predefined database
The strength paper static slicing technique work binary code need source code
The slicing whole binary code segment help select specific piece code critical security point view rather checking whole program
The slicing improves analysis code change program meaning
The weakness paper disassembling binary code specific COTS disassembler mentioned
With increasing use distributed system security becoming important issue
COTS component software ready integration large system
Due source code general detecting malicious code COTS becomes difficult
In absence source code method needed detect malicious behavior COTS software
The paper solves problem using binary code rather source code detection malicious activity COTS static analysis
The paper discussed two method static analysis dynamic analysis used detection malicious code COTS
The strength paper suggests static analysis better dynamic analysis
In static analysis malicious code detected without running program minimizes execution overhead dynamic analysis require program execution
The proposed technique based semantic analysis even detect unknown malicious code
The paper described prototype tool build static detection tested tool known malicious application
The weak point paper since static analysis time consuming may ineffective malicious code inserted analysis done
Another limitation paper proper method presented developing security policy used static verification phase
Lastly developed tool work Windows platform
Backdoors program segment provide unauthorized access data remote system
Once system security bypassed backdoor launched allows intruder access system future
This allows remote user use system launching pad attack system
In way malicious user avoid detection system attack
There generally three type backdoor application backdoor system backdoor crypto backdoor
Application backdoor one inserted software illegal purpose
These backdoor attack network device server application operating system
Due diverse attacking capability application backdoor divided four different category logic based invisible behavior network based security vital parameter
Since application backdoor exist anywhere technique needed detection isolation
This paper introduces static analysis code detection backdoor COTS application

This technique generally used known virus detection
Static analysis flow based inspection technique used examine code without running program
Dynamic analysis search unknown activity given security policy COTS application still running
The drawback technique detect malicious code COTS application developed ready use
To detect malicious code early stage COTS application development mechanism required
In paper author Robert Charpentier Martin Salois introduced technique called certifying compiler detection malicious code COTS application
In technique compiler used translate source code machine code made intelligent produce machine code also check source code security policy
The strength paper suggests method called annotation used compilation case source code available
Early detection also ensures secure software beginning
The weak point certifying compiler technique detect malicious code COTS application integrated distributed environment
COTS application attractive due reduced cost development time
But time vulnerable malicious attack
Time bomb one type malicious code exist COTS application
Time bomb piece code application activated specific time reached
The time predefined date time elapsed time
The time bomb malicious code like virus activation particular date time legitimate program like updating virus definition taking backup specific time
Since time bomb use complex hidden logic quite difficult distinguish legitimate code malicious code
To crack time bomb method required

In store information active
This kind stack also known often shortened stack
Although maintenance call stack important proper functioning detail normally hidden automatic
Many computer provide special instruction manipulating stack
A call stack used several related purpose main reason one keep track point active subroutine return control finish executing
An active subroutine one called yet complete execution control handed back point call
Such activation subroutine may nested level recursive special case hence stack structure
If example subroutine call subroutine four different place must know return execution completes
To accomplish following call pushed onto call stack call
Since call stack organized caller push return address onto stack called subroutine finish return address call stack transfer control address
If called subroutine call yet another subroutine push another return address onto call stack information stacking unstacking program dictate
If pushing consumes space allocated call stack error called occurs generally causing program
Adding subroutine entry call stack sometimes called winding conversely removing entry unwinding
There usually exactly one call stack associated running program accurately although additional stack may created handling
Since one important context referred stack implicitly task however accessed explicitly call stack commonly referred stack see
In specific call stack usually hidden programmer
They given access set function memory stack
This example
Most hand require programmer involved manipulating stack
The actual detail stack depend upon available
As noted primary purpose call stack
When subroutine called location address instruction calling routine later resume need saved somewhere
Using stack save return address important advantage alternative
One task stack thus subroutine active simultaneously different task different thing
Another benefit automatically supported
When function call recursively return address need stored activation function later used return function activation
Stack structure provide capability automatically
Depending language machine environment call stack may serve additional purpose including example The typical call stack used return address local parameter known
In environment may fewer function assigned call stack
In example ordinarily return address counted loop parameter index possibly local variable stored call stack environment named although data temporarily placed using special handling code long need call return respected parameter ordinarily stored separate typically called stack Forth terminology even though call stack since usually accessed explicitly
Some Forths also third stack parameter
A composed also called
These data structure containing subroutine state information
This data sometimes referred CFI Call Frame Information
Each stack frame corresponds call subroutine yet terminated return
For example subroutine named currently running called subroutine top part call stack might laid like picture right
A diagram like drawn either direction long placement top direction stack growth understood
Furthermore independently architecture differ whether call stack grow towards higher address towards lower address
The logic diagram independent addressing choice
The stack frame top stack currently executing routine
The stack frame usually includes least following item push order When stack frame size differ different function invocation particular function popping frame stack constitute fixed decrement
At function return stack pointer instead restored value stack pointer function called
Each stack frame contains stack pointer top frame immediately
The stack pointer mutable register shared invocation
A frame pointer given invocation function copy stack pointer function invoked
The location field frame defined relative either top frame negative offset stack pointer relative top frame positive offset frame pointer
The location frame pointer must inherently defined negative offset stack pointer
In system stack frame field contain previous value frame pointer register value caller executing
For example stack frame would memory location holding frame pointer value us shown diagram
The value saved upon entry subroutine restored upon return
Having field known location stack frame enables code access frame successively underneath currently executing routine frame also allows routine easily restore frame pointer frame return
Programming language support also field call frame point stack frame activation procedure closely encapsulates callee
immediate callee
This called keep track static nesting dynamic recursive call provides routine well routine may invoke access local data encapsulating routine every nesting level
Some architecture compiler optimization case store one link enclosing level immediately enclosing deeply nested routine access shallow data traverse several link strategy often called display
Access link optimized away inner function access local data encapsulation case pure function communicating via argument return value example
Some historical computer special display register support nested function compiler modern machine ubiquitous simply reserve word stack pointer needed
For purpose stack frame subroutine caller considered overlap overlap consisting area parameter passed caller callee
In environment caller push argument onto stack thus extending stack frame invokes callee
In environment caller preallocated area top stack frame hold argument supply subroutine call
This area sometimes termed
Under approach size area calculated compiler largest needed called subroutine
Usually call stack manipulation needed site call subroutine minimal good since many call site subroutine called
The value actual argument evaluated call site since specific particular call either pushed onto stack placed register determined used
The actual call instruction branch link typically executed transfer control code target subroutine
In called subroutine first code executed usually termed since necessary housekeeping code statement routine begun
The prologue commonly save return address left register call instruction pushing value onto call stack
Similarly current stack pointer frame pointer value may pushed
Alternatively instruction set architecture automatically provide comparable functionality part action call instruction environment prologue need
If frame pointer used prologue typically set new value frame pointer register stack pointer
Space stack local variable allocated incrementally changing stack pointer
The allows explicit winding call stack called return stack
When subroutine ready return executes epilogue undoes step prologue
This typically restore saved register value frame pointer value stack frame pop entire stack frame stack changing stack pointer value finally branch instruction return address
Under many calling convention item popped stack epilogue include original argument value case usually stack manipulation need done caller
With calling convention however caller responsibility remove argument stack return
Returning called function pop top frame stack perhaps leaving return value
The general act popping one frame stack resume execution elsewhere program called must performed control structure used used
In case stack frame function contains one entry specifying exception handler
When exception thrown stack unwound handler found prepared handle catch type thrown exception
Some language control structure require general unwinding
allows global statement transfer control nested function previously invoked outer function
This operation requires stack unwound removing many stack frame necessary restore proper context transfer control target statement within enclosing outer function
Similarly C function act gotos
allows control happens stack unwound using special operator
When applying stack logically unwound rewound stack continuation
This way implement continuation example using multiple explicit stack application continuation simply activate stack wind value passed
The allows arbitrary executed specified point unwinding rewinding control stack continuation invoked
The call stack sometimes inspected program running
Depending program written compiled information stack used determine intermediate value function call trace
This used generate automated test case like Ruby Smalltalk implement continuation
As example GDB implement interactive inspection call stack running paused C program
Taking sample call stack useful profiling performance program subroutine pointer appears call stack sampling data many time likely code bottleneck inspected performance problem
In language free pointer array writes C mixing control flow data affect execution code return address saved frame pointer simple program data parameter return value call stack security risk possibly common type
One attack involves filling one buffer arbitrary executable code overflowing buffer overwrite return address value point directly executable code
As result function return computer executes code
This kind attack easily blocked
Similar attack succeed even protection enabled including attack coming
Various mitigation proposed storing array completely separate location return stack case Forth programming language

A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

The next step kind support function
Functions perhaps fundamental language feature abstraction code reuse
It allows u refer piece code name
All need know many argument needed type argument function return function computes use function
In particular necessary know function
How assembly language give u kind support
To think required let think happens function call
Programming language make function easy maintain write giving function section memory operate
For example suppose following function
You declare parameter
You also declare local variable
You know variable wo interfere variable function even function use variable name
In fact also know variable wo interfere separate invocation
For example consider recursive function Each call produce new memory location
Thus separate call invocation copy
How get implemented
In order understand function call need understand stack need understand assembly language like MIPS deal stack
Let look stack
The stack pointer usually register contains top stack
The stack pointer contains smallest address address smaller considered garbage address greater equal considered valid
In example stack pointer contains value somewhat arbitrarily chosen
The shaded region diagram represents valid part stack
It useful think following aspect stack
Usually push pop defined follows The stack pointer convention
That register
We say convention MIPS ISA force use register
However convention follow expect code work piece code
Here implement equivalent MIPS push register onto stack
The label push unnecessary
It make easier tell push
The code would work fine without label
Here diagram push operation
The diagram left show stack push operation
The diagram center show stack pointer decremented
The diagram right show stack byte register copied address You might wonder necessary update stack pointer
Could following
Certainly equivalent behavior far register saved stack
However like maintain invariant address greater equal stack pointer hold valid data address le stack pointer hold invalid data
If ran code would valid data address smaller stack pointer
It make bookkeeping much easier follow convention
Here diagram pop operation
The diagram left initial state stack
The data copied stack register
Thus diagram center one left
If I drawn picture content register would updated data stack
Then stack pointer moved shown diagram right
As see data still stack pop operation completed consider part data invalid
Thus next push operation overwrites data
But OK assume pop operation data popped considered garbage
If ever made error returning pointer local variable parameter passed value wondered value stayed valid initially later got corrupted know reason
The data still stay garbage part stack next push operation overwrites data get corrupted
For example suppose want push register stack
This code Since register take byte since memory address store byte need decrement value stack pointer give u space store register
At point copy content register stack
It somewhat arbitrary order put register stack
In code register top stack
We could easily put register top stack
The way shown seems orderly
Popping similar
Let imagine starting C program
The stack look something like We call
It also called
A stack frame exists whenever function started yet complete
Suppose inside body call
Suppose take two argument
One way pas argument stack
Thus need assembly language code push argument onto stack
The result look like As see placing argument stack stack frame increased size
We also reserved space return value
The return value computed filled done
Once get code function may need local variable need push space stack look like access argument passed code place argument expects
We added new pointer called stand
The frame pointer point location stack pointer moved stack pointer local variable
Having frame pointer convenient function likely move stack pointer several time throughout course running function
The idea keep frame pointer fixed duration stack frame
The stack pointer meanwhile change value
Thus use frame pointer compute location memory argument well local variable
Since move computation location fixed offset frame pointer
And time exit set stack pointer frame pointer effectively pop stack frame
It quite handy frame pointer
We imagine stack growing call another function say
would push argument stack pushed argument stack
So exit stack look pushed stack frame except time return value filled
Once return value pop argument stack
It return back way well
For example consider code
Suppose called
Then base case never reached well might reached decrement far wrap around
This cause one stack frame another pushed
Once stack limit reached enter invalid memory address operating system take kill programming telling program stack overflow
Probably common cause stack overflow recursive function hit base case soon enough
For fan recursion problem keep mind
Some language say ML convert certain kind recursive function called function loop constant amount space used
This CPUs used
With RISC revolution admittedly nearly year old large number register used typical RISC machine goal try avoid using stack
Why
The stack physical memory RAM
Compared accessing register accessing memory much slower order time slow access RAM access register
MIPS many register following In general make calling function little easier
In particular calling function usually need place anything stack function called
However clearly panacea
In particular imagine call
Arguments passed using say
What happens call
If pas argument convention supposed pas using etc
What need argument value afterwards
To prevent argument getting overwritten need save argument stack
Thus entirely avoid using stack
Eventually run code leaf procedure
This function make call function
Clearly leaf procedure would exit program least usual way
If obvious try think must leaf procedure
In leaf procedure call function need save argument stack
also need save return value stack
You use argument value register place return value return value register
There also complicated language feature called appear language like
coded way require stack effect act like queue
Nevertheless vast majority language implement function use stack
The code written say C hundred line code rather unwieldy write assembly language
Notice heap memory heap data structure
Those two different kind heap really related
We discussed argument return value used stack function call result stack frame pushed stack
We also talked stack overflow typically recursive function either got bad base case unexpected argument
Occasionally stack overflow occur stack grows big

Let say web service located WSDL
Is endpoint URI web service SOAP message received unmarshalled
Could please explain purpose
This shorter hopefully clearer answer
Yes endpoint URL service accessed client application
The web service multiple endpoint example order make available using different protocol
Updated answer Peter comment This de old terminology use directally translated port endpoint
Maybe find answer document A WSDL document defines service collection network endpoint port
In WSDL abstract definition endpoint message separated concrete network deployment data format binding
This allows reuse abstract definition message abstract description data exchanged port type abstract collection operation
The concrete protocol data format specification particular port type constitutes reusable binding
A port defined associating network address reusable binding collection port define service
Hence WSDL document us following element definition network service The endpoint connection point HTML file active server page exposed
Endpoints provide information needed address Web service endpoint
The endpoint provides reference specification used define group family message addressing property give message characteristic reference source destination endpoint identity message allow uniform addressing independent message
The endpoint PC PDA terminal
A web service endpoint URL another would use communicate program
To see WSDL add web service endpoint URL
Web service interaction web page interaction
So Endpoint Therefore WSDL To expand element WSDL I always find helpful compare code A WSDL portion physical abstract
Definitions variable ex myVar x etc
Types data type ex int double String myObjectType Operations ex myMethod myFunction etc
Messages input parameter return type Porttypes class
container operation ex MyClass etc
Binding connect porttypes define chosen protocol communicating web service
protocol form communication phone email etc
Service list address another program find web service

In past project I worked endpoint relative property
That say may may appended always contained
If service called dynamic part example part would get added endpoint
But many time endpoint could used without amended
Whats important understand endpoint help
For example alternative way pas information stored endpoint would store different part endpoint separate property
For example Or host port across multiple service In case full URL would need constructed code In contract stored endpoint And yes many time stored endpoint including
This lead code like Hope shed light
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

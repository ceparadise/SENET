A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

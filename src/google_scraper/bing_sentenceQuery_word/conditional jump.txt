A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

transfer also known conditional branching whereby would able jump different instruction depending value data
This extremely powerful feature missing many early computer century

The conditional control structure allows program follow alternative path execution
Iteration looping give computer much power
They repeat sequence step often necessary appropriate repetition quite simple step solve computer Colossus conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot flexibility machine conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot

In feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Apart case always achieved selectively altering based condition
In language term conditional usually used whereas term conditional conditional construct preferred term distinct meaning
A conditional sometimes colloquially referred especially perceived simple one specific form irrelevant unknown
Although usually classified conditional construct another way select alternative
The construct sometimes called common across many programming language
Although syntax varies language language basic structure form look like In example code part represented constitutes conditional intrinsic value may substituted either value intrinsic meaning
In contrast combination expression surrounding consequent follows afterward constitute conditional intrinsic meaning expressing coherent logical rule intrinsic value
When find expects condition example mean variable x contains number greater zero evaluates condition
If condition statement following executed
Otherwise execution continues following branch either usually optional branch
After either branch executed return point
In early programming language especially dialect statement could contain statement
This led style programming known program style called
As result allows virtually arbitrary statement put statement block inside statement gained popularity became norm even BASIC programming circle
Such mechanism principle based older advanced family language language influenced modern BASIC variant many year
While possible using statement statement write program spaghetti code well structured readable program written structured programming language structured programming make easier enforces
Structured statement like example one key element structured programming present popular programming language
A subtlety optional else clause found many language mean since conditionals parsed multiple way
Specifically parsed depending whether associated first second
This known problem resolved various way depending language
By using possible combine several condition
Only statement following first condition found true executed
All statement skipped
The statement simply followed
In Ada difference one needed one us instead followed
This similar provides keyword avoid large number brace would required multiple statement also us special keyword structure denoted indentation rather brace repeated use would require increased indentation every condition
Similarly earlier UNIX shell later gathered POSIX shell syntax use elif giving choice delimiting space line break
However many language directly descended Algol special syntax construct present present many syntactical derivative C PHP
This work language statement case follow conditional without enclosed block
This design choice slight cost code branch effectively adding extra nesting level complicating job compiler implementors analyse implement arbitrarily long chain recursively
If term sequence conditionals testing value single expression alternative also called
Conversely language switch statement produced sequence statement
Many language support similar statement return value result
Thus true expression evaluate value statement change program state perform kind action
member family allow expression In dialect first inspired great extent ALGOL In part compulsory every expression must value
Logic would expressed conditionals language usually expressed recursive function
Because Haskell possible write control structure ordinary expression lazy evaluation mean evaluate condition proper branch strict language would evaluate three
It written like language special conditional expression function may described template like This mean inlined expression unlike language compared expression similar Ruby Scala among others
To accomplish using would take one line code typical layout convention Some argue explicit statement easier read may compile efficient code ternary operator others argue concise expression easier read statement spread several line
First user run program cursor appears waiting reader type number
If number greater text My variable named
displayed screen
If number smaller message My variable named
printed screen
In language function called provided used conditional expression
However behave like true conditional expression true false branch always evaluated result one thrown away result returned IIf function
Up language Fortran arithmetic statement halfway computed IF case statement based This earliest conditional statement Fortran Where e numeric expression necessarily integer equivalent Because equivalent multiple statement could jump anywhere considered unstructured control statement used structured statement used
In practice observed arithmetic statement referenced following statement one two label
This conditional control statement original implementation Fortran computer
On computer three address three state
Other computer would flag register positive zero negative even overflow carry associated last arithmetic operation would use instruction accumulator negative accumulator zero similar
Note expression evaluated case integer arithmetic overflow may occur overflow carry flag would considered also
In contrast language conditional statement defined class abstract method take two parameter
two subclass define method executing first closure executing second closure
In concept conditional expressed using expression ifThenElse passed two function left right conditionals also pas empty tuple result ifThenElse order actually call chosen function otherwise ifThenElse return function object without getting called
In system number used without definition like Lisp Traditional paper math expressed single closure Here true false ifThenElse bound respective definition passed scope end block
A working JavaScript analogy using function single variable rigor The code multivariable function look like another version earlier example without system number assumed
First example show first branch taken second example show second branch taken
Smalltalk us similar idea true false representation True False singleton object respond message differently
Haskell used use exact model Boolean type time writing Haskell program use syntactic sugar b else c construct unlike ifThenElse compose unless either wrapped another function shown The Haskell section page
language multiway branch compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In dynamic language case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
may seen sophisticated alternative statement
It available many programming language functional programming feature many others
Here simple example written language The power pattern matching ability match action also pattern data
Here example written illustrates feature This code defines function applies first argument function element second argument list return resulting list
The two line two definition function two kind argument possible case one list empty return empty list case list empty
Pattern matching strictly speaking choice construct possible Haskell write one alternative guaranteed always matched situation used choice construct simply way bind name value
However frequently used choice construct language available
In programming language comparable data structure idiomatic use implement conditional assignment
In language allow programmer assign named function variable reference conditional flow implemented using hash
An alternative conditional branch instruction
Predication feature enables instruction conditionally executed instead modifying
This table refers recent language specification language
For language specification latest officially released implementation referred

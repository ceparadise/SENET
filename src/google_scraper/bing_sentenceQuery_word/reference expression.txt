An combination one explicit programming language interprets according particular association computes produce return environment another value
This process called evaluation
In simple setting usually one various numerical elaborate setting arbitrary
For example arithmetic programming expression evaluates
A variable expression denotes value memory expression
An example relational expression evaluates
In language call function return type valid expression type void
Values type void used value expression always thrown away
In many programming language function hence expression containing function may
An expression side effect normally property
In many language
expression may ended semicolon turn expression expression
This asks implementation evaluate expression disregard result expression
unless part expression statement induces

Note formal notion side effect change abstract state running program
Another class side effect change concrete state computational system loading data cache memory
Languages often described side generally still concrete side effect exploited example
Furthermore elapsed time evaluating expression even one apparent side effect sometimes essential correct operation system behaviour time easily visible outside evaluation environment part system interacts might even regarded effect performing
It depends particular programming language specification whether expression abstract side effect execution path processing environment expression evaluated

An expression particular concept computer science number variable constant operator function put together single statement acted particular programming language
In computer science expression written developer interpreted computer The evaluation produce return result
Simple mathematical equation expression code
They typically called arithmetic expression
Other kind numerical arithmetic expression may use variable look like algebra equation
In addition various data type character string integer floating point number others acted expression constant variable
Operators function determine computer act object given expression
Different type expression categorized according work Boolean expression evaluate either true false value numerical expression evaluate number
String expression evaluate character string text character string changed function produce different result
For instance adding exclamation point display printing phrase world would example string expression us function add ASCII character rather changing numerical value creating different code condition
In example different program would treat differently Some primitive one may use syntax like print hello world print
others might use something like String hello world String b
Print string string b Like kind fundamental expression rely specific syntax programming language
In term structure expert point expression inherently need least one value acted must one operator
Beyond important programmer understand program syntax
Inputting incorrect illegal syntax result compiling error developer make expression code module conform proper syntax order run

In Python difference expression statement
contain operator include arithmetic boolean operator function similar reduced kind value Python object
Examples Statements see hand everything make line several line Python code
Note expression statement well
Examples dictionary expression collection symbol jointly express quantity expression circumference circle
In gross general term In Python expression covered extensively In general expression Python composed syntactically legal combination
Examples expression syntactically correct combination call function Wikipedia In computer programming statement thought smallest standalone element imperative programming language
A program formed sequence one statement
A statement internal component expression
In gross general term often composed expression statement The Python Language Reference cover extensively
The distinction Statements something expression produce value distinction become blurry however Though related Python An evaluates value
A something
Statements represent action command Expression combination variable operation value yield result value
Lastly expression statement An expression something reduced value example
It easy check If work statement expression
Another statement could reduced value
An expression something statement something
An expression statement well must return
PS The interpreter always print value expression
Python call expression expression statement question perhaps fully formed
A statement consists pretty much anything Python calculating value assigning value deleting variable printing value returning function raising exception etc
The full list An expression statement limited calling function theta operator etc
produce value
A statement contains keyword
An expression contain keyword
statement keyword
expression list compression
The following expression statement true without list comprehension I think expression contains operator operand object hold result operation
statement simply line code may expression block code
expression evaluates type associated
Statements composed expression
It span multiple line

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
trying formulate algorithm syntax checking simple boolean expression like
evaluation part seems easy convert infix postfix evaluate postfix without
fully sure method using
one point book algorithm link
What describing part area knowledge known specifically
One classical book
Parsing evaluating expression like usually done three interlocked step Lexical analysis
This part charge converting input sequence lexeme
It convert example lexeme VARIABLE NUMBER VARIABLE NUMBER
This step implemented using regular automaton
Syntax analysis
This part construct parse tree expression
In case parse tree generated using This step implemented using language either using approach using recursive descent

I Googled question searched SO however I ca seem get straight answer
Is question basic thought ask yet
Can someone please explain exactly expression programming
Also I program primarily Javascript definition varies JS could please also highlight difference
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
In Javascript An expression valid unit code resolve value
Conceptually two type expression assign value variable simply value
The expression x example first type
This expression us operator assign value seven variable x
The expression evaluates seven
The code example second expression type
This expression us operator add three four together without assigning result seven variable
JavaScript following expression category Arithmetic evaluates number example
Generally us arithmetic operator
String evaluates character string example Fred
Generally us string operator
Logical evaluates true false
Often involves logical operator
Object evaluates object
See special operator various one evaluate object
Source Microsoft explanation expression following completely clear If look link bottom article term statement expression statement clarified

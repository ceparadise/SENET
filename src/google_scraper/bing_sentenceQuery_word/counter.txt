I think store address current instruction
And instruction completed program counter incremented get next instruction
But question increment program counter
It would mean increment address work
Assuming architecture alignment instruction word every instruction composed byte
That implies bottom two bit address byte offset within word address denotes byte word
When talking instruction however never need fetch individual byte want whole word
Different textbook handle program counter differently given whichever paradigm using program counter incremented rather lead believe PC store address rather byte address
Then program counter increment fact get
To turn address byte address fetch instruction memory simply
In short program counter address address instruction actually fetching
To fetch next instruction increment program counter

But Ghz referring
This referring
The clock computer clock wall used tell time
A computer clock like metronome keep beat musician play music
A clock change value every period
We use letter designate period
This signal repeat
Perhaps remember course calculus sine wave
This wave repeat per period
The difference sine wave clock sine wave curved
It gradually increase decrease
A clock signal squarish shape
Related period clock
Frequency defined unit
When hear clock rate usually given frequency
Thus Ghz mean cycle per second
A signal single period
The period clock second half nanosecond really really short period time
To give idea short time
Imagine everyone world sang exactly one note exactly one person sings time
Suppose note last one nanosecond
It would take second complete assuming billion people world
As see clock signal positive slope negative slope
This slope exaggerated see better
Normally would quite angled
There key feature clock Each positive clock edge appears per clock period
Each negative clock edge appears per clock period
Must clock always
The answer
We could clock stay three quarter period one quarter period fraction
If using positive edge matter long signal stay since use edge
However want use positive negative edge going consider want edge occur
Begin move finger right trace signal
Your finger move back
If happen trace positive edge second steadily moving right going faster slower period second frequency Hz
Tracing signal hand give better feel continuous signal behaves
Usually computer science major difficult time unless really like calculus engineering deal quantity discrete rather continuous
At point time someone ask current value signal
If use pipe analogy think signal alternating pumping red soda green soda
To give analogy imagine music conductor tapping beat baton stick regular interval
Suppose playing piano told play new note time tap baton
Thus fast conductor tap baton control often play note
Similarly rate positive clock edge appears control fast sequential logic device change output
It turn using clock design CPU easily use clock
This primary reason use clock

A counter circuit usually constructed number connected cascade
Counters widely used component manufactured separate also incorporated part larger integrated circuit
In counter implemented quite easily using circuit wide variety classification exist Each useful different application
Usually counter circuit nature count
Many type counter circuit available digital building block example number chip implement different counter
Occasionally advantage using counting sequence natural binary counter counter counter
Counters useful digital clock timer oven timer VCR clock etc
An asynchronous ripple counter single J data input fed inverted output
This circuit store one bit hence count zero one overflow start
This counter increment every clock cycle take two clock cycle overflow every cycle alternate transition transition
Notice creates new clock exactly half frequency input clock
If output used clock signal similarly arranged D remembering invert output input one get another bit counter count half fast
Putting together yield counter You continue add additional always inverting output input using output previous clock signal
The result called ripple counter count number bit stage counter
Ripple counter suffer unstable output overflow ripple stage stage find frequent application divider clock signal instantaneous count unimportant division overall clarify counter exactly equivalent divide two circuit output frequency exactly half input fed regular train clock pulse
The use output clock lead timing skew count data bit making ripple technique incompatible normal design style
In synchronous counter clock input connected together triggered input pulse
Thus change state simultaneously parallel
The circuit synchronous counter
The J K input connected HIGH
J K input connected output J K input connected output AND gate fed output
A simple way implementing logic bit ascending counter depicted adjacent image bit toggle le significant bit logic high state
For example bit toggle bit logic high bit toggle bit bit logic high bit toggle bit bit bit high
Synchronous counter also implemented hardware complex allow smoother stable transition
A decade counter one count decimal digit rather binary
A decade counter may may count integrated circuit binary encoding
A decade counter binary counter designed count decimal
An ordinary counter easily modified decade counter adding NAND gate schematic right
Notice provide input NAND gate
The NAND gate output connected CLR input FFs
A decade counter one count decimal digit rather binary
It count reset zero
The counter output set zero pulsing reset line low
The count increment clock pulse reach decimal
When increment decimal input NAND gate go high
The result NAND output go low reset counter zero
D going low CARRY OUT signal indicating count ten
A ring counter circular shift register initiated one state one others zero state
A ring counter cascade connection output last one connected input first ring
Typically pattern consisting single bit circulated state repeat every n clock cycle n used
A modified ring counter output last stage inverted fed back input first stage
The register cycle sequence whose length equal twice length shift register continuing indefinitely
These counter find specialist application including similar decade counter conversion etc
They implemented easily using
In considered type memory
A counter store single initially arbitrarily long
A counter usually considered conjunction FSM perform following operation counter The following machine listed order power one strictly powerful one For first last matter whether FSM
They power
The first two last one level
The first machine FSM plus two counter equivalent power
See article proof
A computer software program indicates number visitor hit particular received
Once set counter incremented one every time web page accessed
The number usually displayed inline physical counter
Images may presented variety style classic example wheel
popular later replaced detailed complete measure
Many automation system use PC laptop monitor different parameter machine production data
Counters may count parameter number piece produced production batch number measurement amount material used
Long electronics became common mechanical device used count event
These known
They typically consist series disk mounted axle digit marked edge
The right disk move one increment event
Each disk except protrusion completion one revolution move next disk left one increment
Such counter used bicycle car production machinery well machinery
One largest manufacturer company name often used type counter
Hand held used mainly stocktaking counting people attending event
counter used accumulate total pioneered data processing industry

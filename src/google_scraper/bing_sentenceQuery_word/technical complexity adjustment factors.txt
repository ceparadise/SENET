Algorithmic complexity concerned fast slow particular algorithm performs
We define complexity numerical function time versus input size
We want define time taken algorithm without depending implementation detail
But agree depend implementation
A given algorithm take different amount time input depending factor processor speed instruction set disk speed brand compiler etc
The way around estimate efficiency algorithm
We measure time number elementary step defined way provided step take constant time
Let u consider two classical example addition two integer
We add two integer digit digit bit bit define step computational model
Therefore say addition two integer take n step
Consequently total computational time time taken addition two bit
On different computer additon two bit might take different time say c c thus additon two integer take respectively
This show different machine result different slope time grows linearly input size increase
The process abstracting away detail determining rate resource usage term input size one fundamental idea computer science
The goal computational complexity classify algorithm according performance
We represent time function T n using notation express algorithm runtime complexity
For example following statement Intuitively mean function f n grow faster g n function g n f n sufficiently large Here graphic representation f n O g n relation The notation symmetric n O n n O n

Let u prove n n O n
We must find c n n n
Let n n An algorithm said run constant time requires amount time regardless input size
Examples An algorithm said run linear time time execution directly proportional input size
time grows linearly input size increase
Examples An algorithm said run logarithmic time time execution proportional logarithm input size
Example Recall twenty question game task guess value hidden number interval
Each time make guess told whether guess i high low
Twenty question game imploies strategy us guess number halve interval size
This example general method known Note log n n
Algorithms run O log n use whole input
An algorithm said run logarithmic time time execution proportional square input size
Examples Consider dynamic array stack
In model push double array size enough space
Since copying array performed constant time say push also done constant time
In section show push take amortized constant time
Let u count number copying operation needed sequence push
We see push requires copy
We see push requires copy
We see push requires copy
In general push requires copy
Asymptotically speaking number copy number push

Definitions complexity often depend concept confidential set part element relationship among differentiated relationship element outside relational regime
Many definition tend postulate assume complexity express condition numerous element system numerous form relationship among element
However one see complex one see simple relative change time

Weaver perceived addressed problem least preliminary way drawing distinction disorganized complexity organized complexity
In Weaver view disorganized complexity result particular system large number part say million part many
Though interaction part disorganized complexity situation seen largely random property system whole understood using probability statistical method
A prime example disorganized complexity gas container gas molecule part
Some would suggest system disorganized complexity may compared relative planetary orbit latter predicted applying
Of course system including planetary orbit eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamic discovered modern
Organized complexity Weaver view resides nothing else correlated interaction part
These correlated relationship create differentiated structure system interact system
The coordinated system manifest property carried dictated individual part
The organized aspect form complexity system subject system said emerge without guiding hand
The number part large particular system emergent property
A system organized complexity may understood property behavior among property particularly
An example organized complexity city neighborhood living mechanism neighborhood people among system part

In algorithmic information theory concerned complexity string data
Complex string harder compress
While intuition tell u may depend used compress string codec could theoretically created arbitrary language including one small command X could cause computer output complicated string like two language implemented meaning length two encoding different language vary length translation language end negligible sufficiently large data string
These algorithmic measure complexity tend assign high value
However studying complex system would consider randomness complexity
also sometimes used information theory indicative complexity
Recent work examined complexity data affect performance classification algorithm
Ho Basu present set problem

A recent study based molecular simulation compliance constant describes phenomenon organisation

Computational complexity theory study complexity problem difficulty
Problems classified complexity class according time take algorithm usually computer program solve function problem size
Some problem difficult solve others easy
For example difficult problem need algorithm take exponential amount time term size problem solve
Take example
It solved time size network visit number city travelling salesman must visit exactly
As size network city grows time needed find route grows exponentially
Even though problem may computationally solvable principle actual practice may simple
These problem might require large amount time inordinate amount space
may approached many different aspect

branch focus classifying according inherent difficulty relating
A computational problem understood task principle amenable solved computer equivalent stating problem may solved mechanical application mathematical step
A problem regarded inherently difficult solution requires significant resource whatever algorithm used
The theory formalizes intuition introducing mathematical study problem quantifying amount resource needed solve time storage
Other measure also used amount communication used number circuit used number processor used
One role computational complexity theory determine practical limit computer
Closely related field theoretical computer science
A key distinction analysis algorithm computational complexity theory former devoted analyzing amount resource needed particular algorithm solve problem whereas latter asks general question possible algorithm could used solve problem
More precisely computational complexity theory try classify problem solved appropriately restricted resource
In turn imposing restriction available resource distinguishes computational complexity computability theory latter theory asks kind problem principle solved algorithmically
A viewed infinite collection together every instance
The input string computational problem referred problem instance confused problem
In computational complexity theory problem refers abstract question solved
In contrast instance problem rather concrete utterance serve input decision problem
For example consider problem
The instance number
solution yes number prime otherwise case
Stated another way particular input problem output corresponding given input
To highlight difference problem instance consider following instance decision version Is route kilometre passing Germany largest city
The quantitative answer particular problem instance little use solving instance problem asking round trip site whose total length km
For reason complexity theory address computational problem particular problem instance
When considering computational problem problem instance
Usually alphabet taken binary alphabet set thus string
As mathematical object bitstrings must suitably encoded
For example represented encoded directly via encoding binary
Even though proof theorem regularly assume concrete choice input encoding one try keep discussion abstract enough independent choice encoding
This achieved ensuring different representation transformed efficiently
one central object study computational complexity theory
A decision problem special type computational problem whose answer either alternately either
A decision problem viewed member language instance whose output yes instance whose output
The objective decide aid whether given input string member formal language consideration
If algorithm deciding problem return answer algorithm said accept input string otherwise said reject input
An example decision problem following
The input arbitrary
The problem consists deciding whether given graph
The formal language associated decision problem set connected course obtain precise definition language one decide graph encoded binary string
A computational problem single output expected every input output complex yes
Notable example include
It tempting think notion function problem much richer notion decision problem
However really case since function problem recast decision problem
For example multiplication two integer expressed set triple relation hold
Deciding whether given triple member set corresponds solving problem multiplying two number
To measure difficulty solving computational problem one may wish see much time best algorithm requires solve problem
However running time may general depend instance
In particular larger instance require time solve
Thus time required solve problem space required measure complexity calculated function size instance
This usually taken size input bit
Complexity theory interested algorithm scale increase input size
For instance problem finding whether graph connected much time take solve problem graph vertex compared time taken graph vertex
If input size time taken expressed function
Since time taken different input size different time complexity T defined maximum time taken input size
If T polynomial algorithm said algorithm
say problem solved feasible amount resource admits polynomial time algorithm
A Turing machine mathematical model general computing machine
It theoretical device manipulates symbol contained strip tape
Turing machine intended practical computing technology rather thought experiment representing computing advanced supercomputer mathematician pencil paper
It believed problem solved algorithm exists Turing machine solves problem
Indeed statement
Furthermore known everything computed model computation known u today programming language computed Turing machine
Since Turing machine easy analyze mathematically believed powerful model computation Turing machine commonly used model complexity theory
Many type Turing machine used define complexity class
They equally powerful principle resource time space bounded may powerful others
A deterministic Turing machine basic Turing machine us fixed set rule determine future action
A probabilistic Turing machine deterministic Turing machine extra supply random bit
The ability make probabilistic decision often help algorithm solve problem efficiently
Algorithms use random bit called
A Turing machine deterministic Turing machine added feature allows Turing machine multiple possible future action given state
One way view Turing machine branch many possible computational path step solves problem branch said solved problem
Clearly model meant physically realizable model theoretically interesting abstract machine give rise particularly interesting complexity class
For example see
Many machine model different standard proposed literature example
Perhaps surprisingly model converted another without providing extra computational power
The time memory consumption alternate model may vary
What model common machine operate
However computational problem easier analyze term unusual resource
For example Turing machine computational model allowed branch check many different possibility
The Turing machine little physically want compute algorithm branching exactly capture many mathematical model want analyze important resource analyzing computational problem
For precise definition mean solve problem using given amount time space computational model used
The deterministic Turing machine input total number state transition step machine make halt output answer yes
A Turing machine said operate within time time required input length
A decision problem solved time exists Turing machine operating time solves problem
Since complexity theory interested classifying problem based difficulty one defines set problem based criterion
For instance set problem solvable within time deterministic Turing machine denoted
Analogous definition made space requirement
Although time space complexity resource viewed computational resource
Complexity measure generally defined
Other complexity measure used complexity theory include
The complexity algorithm often expressed using
The complexity refer three different way measuring time complexity complexity measure different input size
Since input size may faster solve others define following complexity For example consider deterministic sorting algorithm
This solves problem sorting list integer given input
The input sorted sorted reverse order algorithm take time case
If assume possible permutation input list equally likely average time taken sorting O log
The best case occurs pivoting divide list half also needing O log time
To classify computation time similar resource space consumption one interested proving upper lower bound minimum amount time required efficient algorithm solving given problem
The complexity algorithm usually taken complexity unless specified otherwise
Analyzing particular algorithm fall field
To show upper bound time complexity problem one need show particular algorithm running time
However proving lower bound much difficult since lower bound make statement possible algorithm solve given problem
The phrase possible algorithm includes algorithm known today algorithm might discovered future
To show lower bound problem requires showing algorithm time complexity lower
Upper lower bound usually stated using hide constant factor smaller term
This make bound independent specific detail computational model used
For instance big O notation one would write O
A set problem related complexity
Simpler complexity class defined following factor Of course complexity class complicated definition fit framework
Thus typical complexity class definition like following But bounding computation time concrete function often yield complexity class depend chosen machine model
For instance language binary string solved Turing machine necessarily requires quadratic time model Turing machine
If allow polynomial variation running time state time complexity two reasonable general model computation polynomially related Chapter
This form basis complexity class set decision problem solvable deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time
The corresponding set function problem
Many important complexity class defined bounding time space used algorithm
Some important complexity class decision problem defined manner following The class necessarily take account space needed represent problem
It turn PSPACE NPSPACE EXPSPACE NEXPSPACE
Other important complexity class include defined using defined using Boolean circuit defined using quantum Turing machine
important complexity class counting problem decision problem
Classes like defined using
class decision problem
For complexity class defined way desirable prove relaxing requirement say computation time indeed defines bigger set problem
In particular although DTIME contained DTIME would interesting know inclusion strict
For time space requirement answer question given time space hierarchy theorem respectively
They called hierarchy theorem induce proper hierarchy class defined constraining respective resource
Thus pair complexity class one properly included
Having deduced proper set inclusion proceed make quantitative statement much additional time space needed order increase number problem solved
More precisely state The state The time space hierarchy theorem form basis separation result complexity class
For instance time hierarchy theorem tell u P strictly contained EXPTIME space hierarchy theorem tell u L strictly contained PSPACE
Many complexity class defined using concept reduction
A reduction transformation one problem another problem
It capture informal notion problem least difficult another problem
For instance problem solved using algorithm difficult say
There many different type reduction based method reduction Cook reduction Karp reduction Levin reduction bound complexity reduction
The commonly used reduction reduction
This mean reduction process take polynomial time
For example problem squaring integer reduced problem multiplying two integer
This mean algorithm multiplying two integer used square integer
Indeed done giving input input multiplication algorithm
Thus see squaring difficult multiplication since squaring reduced multiplication
This motivates concept problem hard complexity class
A problem class problem every problem reduced
Thus problem harder since algorithm allows u solve problem
Of course notion hard problem depends type reduction used
For complexity class larger P reduction commonly used
In particular set problem hard NP set problem
If problem hard said
This mean hardest problem
Since many problem could equally hard one might say one hardest problem
Thus class problem contains difficult problem NP sense one likely Because problem P NP solved able reduce known problem Π another problem Π would indicate known solution Π
This solution Π would yield solution Π
Similarly NP problem reduced set finding problem solved polynomial time would mean P NP
The complexity class P often seen mathematical abstraction modeling computational task admit efficient algorithm
This hypothesis called
The complexity class hand contains many problem people would like solve efficiently efficient algorithm known
Since deterministic Turing machine special Turing machine easily observed problem P also member class NP
The question whether P equal NP one important open question theoretical computer science wide implication solution
If answer yes many important problem shown efficient solution
These include various type problem many problem ability find formal proof theorem
The P versus NP problem one proposed
There US prize resolving problem
It shown Ladner exist problem neither
Such problem called problem
The example problem believed
They NP problem known
The computational problem determining whether two finite
An important unsolved problem complexity theory whether graph isomorphism problem
The answer known believed problem least
If graph isomorphism collapse second level
Since widely believed polynomial hierarchy collapse finite level believed graph isomorphism
The best algorithm problem due run time graph vertex although recent work Babai offer potentially new perspective
The computational problem determining given integer
Phrased decision problem problem deciding whether input prime factor le
No efficient integer factorization algorithm known fact form basis several modern cryptographic system algorithm
The integer factorization problem even UP
If problem polynomial time hierarchy collapse first level equal
The best known algorithm integer factorization take time factor integer
However best known problem run polynomial time
Unfortunately fact say much problem lie respect complexity class
Many known complexity class suspected unequal proved
For instance possible
If equal equal either
Since many known complexity class possible complexity class collapse one class
Proving class unequal would major breakthrough complexity theory
Along line class containing problem
problem answer reversed problem
It believed equal however yet proven
It clear two complexity class equal equal since would also since problem dual
Similarly known set problem solved logarithmic space strictly contained equal
Again many complexity class two known distinct equal class
It suspected equal
However currently open
A problem solved theory
given large finite resource especially time practice solution take many resource useful known
Conversely problem solved practice called literally problem handled
The term literally done sometimes used interchangeably though risk confusion
Tractable problem frequently identified problem solution known
Problems known intractable sense include
If NP P problem also intractable sense
However identification inexact solution large exponent large constant term grows quickly may impractical practical size problem conversely solution grows slowly may practical realistic input solution take long time worst case may take short time case average case thus still practical
Saying problem P imply large case problem hard even
For example decision problem shown P yet algorithm written solve problem reasonable time case
Similarly algorithm solve wide range size le quadratic time routinely handle large instance
To see algorithm generally unusable practice consider program make operation halting
For small say assuming sake example computer operation second program would run year order magnitude
Even much faster computer program would useful small instance sense intractability problem somewhat independent technological progress
However algorithm take operation practical get relatively large
Similarly polynomial time algorithm always practical
If running time say unreasonable consider efficient still useless except small instance
Indeed practice even algorithm often impractical realistic size problem
An early example algorithm complexity analysis running time analysis done
Before actual research explicitly devoted complexity algorithmic problem started numerous foundation laid various researcher
Most influential among definition Turing machine turned robust flexible simplification computer
The beginning systematic study computational complexity attributed seminal paper On Computational Complexity Algorithms laid definition proved hierarchy theorem
In addition suggested consider good algorithm one running time bounded polynomial input size
Earlier paper studying problem solvable Turing machine specific bounded resource include definition Myhill study rudimentary set well paper computation
Somewhat earlier pioneer field USSR studied another specific complexity measure
As remembers However initial interest automaton theory increasingly set aside favor computational complexity exciting fusion combinatorial method inherited conceptual arsenal theory algorithm
These idea occurred earlier I coined term signalizing function nowadays commonly known complexity measure
In developed axiomatic complexity theory based proved important result
The field really began flourish US researcher working independently USSR proved exist practically relevant problem
In took idea leap forward landmark paper Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems showed diverse problem infamous computational intractability

However potentially overlapping theory seem exist independently exists scope unifying framework extend innovation diffusion concept system design model particularly design formal theory user acceptance information technology
While million dollar spent information technology US last year recent debate extent expenditure produced benefit business academia LANDAUER
At least part debate revolves around issue whether information technology actually accepted intended user
Without acceptance discretionary user seek alternative even dedicated user likely manifest dissatisfaction perform inefficient manner negating many presumed benefit new technology EASON
In present chapter review treatment issue user acceptance applies information technology design implementation

For present purpose user acceptance defined demonstrable willingness within user group employ information technology task designed support

Thus appropriate tackle topic manner affords reader insight range perspective converge problem well precise empirical finding date
At highest level acceptance subsumed theoretical analysis innovation diffusion appropriate start coverage topic
However precise analysis user acceptance become central concern discipline studying information technology particular rather general technological innovation
This work concentrate directly determinant importance user acceptance rather broad issue social diffusion major focus present chapter
More one theoretical approach necessary complete understanding issue involved clarity approach treated independently outset
Perhaps principal theoretical perspective technology acceptance innovation diffusion theory applied individual ROGERS organizational ZALTMAN ET level analysis
Its primary intention provide account manner technological innovation move stage invention widespread use
Though concerned information technology exclusively diffusion theory offer conceptual framework discussing acceptance global level
Diffusion theory posit five characteristic innovation affect diffusion relative advantage extent technology offer improvement currently available tool compatibility consistency social practice norm among user complexity ease use learning trialability opportunity try innovation committing use observability extent technology output gain clear see
Each characteristic insufficient predict either extent rate diffusion diffusion study demonstrated innovation affording advantage compatibility existing practice belief low complexity potential trialability observability extensively rapidly diffused innovation cluster opposite characteristic ROGERS
An early innovation diffusion literature found three characteristic greatest influence adoption compatibility relative advantage positively related innovation adoption p complexity negatively related adoption marginally significant p level TORNATZKY KLEIN
However author criticized current conceptualization construct
Relative advantage particular cited especially ambiguous criterion used judge advantageous often defined innovation could advantageous cost le le complex
In examining extending characteristic context specific information technology IT MOORE BENBASAT report extensive effort develop instrument used evaluate user perception IT innovation
Their result suggest important perceived characteristic IT innovation affect decision regarding use voluntariness use image degree use innovation perceived enhance one image status one social system relative advantage compatibility ease use trialability result demonstrability visibility
These result lend least partial support ROGERS factor add important emphasis variable related discretion ease use
Innovation diffusion theory suggests factor level individual user also important
ROGERS divide technology innovation adopter five category depending speed uptake innovator early adopter early majority late majority laggard
Such distinction could seen somewhat fuzzy least distribution time could divided
However Rogers plot category normal distribution major category innovator early adopter combined one purpose represents standard deviation dispersion
Accordingly division early late majority mean laggard late adopter constituting population
On basis Rogers estimate early adopter innovator jointly make total population
Early adopter disproportionate influence adoption technology profiling study category revealed number personality adventure seeking socioeconomic wealth education variable supposedly distinguish member
This approach seems direct relevance study IT acceptance organization
BRANCHEAU WETHERBE showed cumulative adoption distribution spreadsheet use closely follows sigmoidal curve predicted innovation diffusion theory
Thus organization evaluating technology use organization must cognizant user base tool designed purchased
For tool used throughout organization reasonable expect protracted period time may required user speed use tool effectively
Understanding user likely laggard important intervention strategy extended training designed user mind
Recent research attempted extend diffusion theory complex adoption scenario
For example managerial influence organization encourage discourage acceptance explicitly expressed preference mandate DESCHAMPS MOORE BENBASAT reward system incentive
Thus study examine acceptance level organization need account potential importance managerial influence
The innovation diffusion approach seems useful area computing EUC within IS literature many theoretically strong EUC study BRANCHEAU WETHERBE MOORE BENBASAT individual level BROWN BOSTROM organizational level based theory innovation diffusion
In fact review analysis EUC literature BRANCHEAU BROWN suggest innovation diffusion promising basis future EUC research
While diffusion theory provides context one may examine uptake impact information technology time provides little explicit treatment user acceptance
Its direct link would appear area innovation characteristic may drive individual adoption decision perceived complexity compatibility etc

FISHBEIN AJZEN Theory Reasoned Action TRA social psychology literature see Figure defines relationship belief attitude norm intention behavior
According theory individual behavior use rejection technology determined one intention perform behavior intention influenced jointly individual attitude subjective norm defined person perception people important think perform behavior question Fishbein Ajzen italicized comment added
According TRA attitude toward behavior determined belief consequence behavior affective evaluation consequence
Beliefs defined individual subjective probability performing given behavior result given consequence
Affective evaluation implicit evaluative response FISHBEIN AJZEN consequence thus attitude construct TRA general nature anchored given belief set

In examining application TRA SHEPPARD ET AL

They concluded theory exceptionally robust offered strong predictive utility even used investigate situation activity falling outside original boundary condition theory predicting nonvoluntary behavior intention assessed even subject information necessary form completely confident intention

Of model widely cited DAVIS Technology Acceptance Model TAM see Figure
The goal TAM predict information system acceptance diagnose design problem user experience system
TAM predicts user acceptance technology determined two factor perceived usefulness perceived ease use
Within TAM perceived usefulness U defined degree user belief using system enhance performance
Perceived ease use EOU defined degree user belief using system free effort
Both U EOU specific perception anchored specific belief user hold system
According TAM U EOU significant impact user attitude toward using system A defined feeling favorableness unfavorableness toward system
Thus attitude general construct tied specific belief technology
Behavioral intention use system BI modeled function A BI determines actual use
Research consistently shown BI strongest predictor actual use DAVIS ET TAYLOR TODD
Figure Acceptance Model DAVIS ET AL There several interesting difference TAM TRA
First DAVIS ET AL explicitly drop subjective norm model arguing subjective norm construct
They explain subjective norm may important setting empirical work validating TAM found important predictor intention
Davis et al explain technology studied personal individual nature use technology dependent others use technology system usage likely driven social influence
Another important difference TAM proposes direct path perceived usefulness intention violating TRA show attitude completely mediating relationship belief intention
According DAVIS ET AL work environment intention use IT may based anticipated impact job performance regardless individual overall attitude toward system
In word even though employee may dislike system employee may still use system perceived increase job performance thus high perceived usefulness
A final note interest regarding TAM divergence TRA direct effect EOU U
In word faced two system offering identical functionality user find easier one useful
DAVIS state user becomes productive via enhancement become productive overall
The converse U influence EOU hold however
Thus theoretical perspective perceived ease use influence perceived usefulness vice versa
In work validating TAM DAVIS ET AL
found stronger relationship perceived usefulness U intention use perceived ease use EOU intention
The relationship EOU intention largely mediated U
In comparing TAM TRA DAVIS found TAM better predictor based amount variance explained intention use particular software package reporting Time immediately introduction software Time week later
These figure compared TRA Time Time respectively
DAVIS report similar result looking different technology removing behavioral intention model
TAM found extremely robust replicated using different task ADAMS ET MATHIESON
In comparison several model Mathieson found TAM predicted intention use spreadsheet package better alternative model
In another comparison theoretical model TAYLOR TODD found TAM provided good fit data use computing resource center accounting variance behavior variance intention variance attitude
In another study examining efficacy TAM ADAMS ET AL

STRAUB ET AL

However objective measure use TAM variable explained variance suggesting factor may significant predictor system usage
While STRAUB ET AL

However area remains relatively unexplored
While Theory Reasoned Action TRA widely used theory examining user acceptance theoretical perspective also used
The Theory Planned Behavior TPB AJZEN descendant TRA add third antecedent intention perceived behavioral control TRA model
Perceived behavioral control determined availability skill resource opportunity well perceived importance skill resource opportunity achieve outcome
Perceived behavioral control viewed close BANDURA belief concept Ajzen
TPB hold attitude subjective norm perceived behavioral control direct determinant intention turn influence behavior

Theory Planned Behavior AJZEN In attempting apply TPB like TRA generalized model Decomposed Theory Planned Behavior TAYLOR TODD also examined IS literature attempt identify model specific antecedent attitude subjective norm perceived behavioral control relevant IT use
Taylor Todd suggest perceived usefulness perceived ease use compatibility antecedent attitude largely consistent TAM
In addition suggest peer influence superior influence antecedent subjective norm
Finally model condition technology facilitating condition determinant perceived behavioral control
While extensively studied TAM literature provides several test TPB
However result somewhat mixed
MATHIESON tested TAM TPB found TPB predictive user intention provide complete explanation intention TAM
In addition Mathieson noted TAM easier apply
TAYLOR TODD tested decomposed version TPB discussed found TAM slightly better predictor usage decomposed TPB model provided complete albeit slight understanding determinant intention TPB TAM
The author note choosing TAM decomposed TPB moderate increase explanatory power intention versus added complexity difficult one
The decomposed TPB add seven variable increase predictive power behavior TAM
However decomposed TPB also help researcher better understand role subjective norm perceived behavioral control absent TAM
Taylor Todd conclude goal predict IT usage TAM may better however goal better understand specific determinant intention decomposed TPB may offer additional explanatory power
Thus Theory Reasoned Action derivative specifically Technology Acceptance Model Theory Planned Behavior provide useful robust composite perspective issue technology acceptance
These theoretical approach provided important contribution MIS research stream additional study attempting build existing body knowledge area

In general cognitive style refers characteristic way individual process use information GOLDSTEIN BLACKMAN seen human information processing term stable pattern handling incoming stimulus formulating response
Cognitive style theorist posit dimension upon individual placed according characteristic pattern information processing
To date one hundred different dimension found literature although core cluster account majority work topic
For example Type Indicator MBTI MYERS based Jungian construct consists four scale designed measure dimension
Despite interest among researcher potential explanatory power variable serious doubt efficacy MBTI suggested empirical testing shown justified ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER HUBER
Personality refers cognitive affective structure maintained individual facilitate adjustment event people situation GINGRAS GOUGH
Personality trait suggested impact IT acceptance include need achievement degree defensiveness locus control dogmatism propensity GINGRAS ZMUD
Many personality construct currently found literature closely resemble cognitive style dimension suggesting general blurring distinction term literature
A number demographic variable including age education also studied shown context influence system use BENBASAT DEXTER MOCK ET TAYLOR
Certainly little surprise age education influence use technology within broad parameter relationship strong enough account even variance user response
ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER include class variable term variable include training experience user involvement correlate well acceptance new technology
In found broad group factor important individual difference variable
These result supported GUIMARAES ET found characteristic decision maker including organizational level experience technology explained variance measure overall satisfaction satisfaction perceived benefit technology
They also found characteristic implementation process including user involvement training top management support similar factor ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER explained significant amount variance measure taken overall satisfaction satisfaction perceived benefit technology
RAMAMURTHY ET AL
examined class variable term user specific characteristic link user effectiveness technology
In model variable suggested affect user performance technology include domain expertise operationalized education LUCAS LUSK domain experience TAYLOR WHITE system experience FUERST CHENEY SANDERS COURTNEY gender DAMBROT ET PARASURAMAN IGBARIA intelligence CHERVANY DICKSON
Ramamurthy et al
also include cognitive style personality important predictor technology performance consistent ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER discussed earlier
In study RAMAMURTHY et al
found domain expertise system experience intelligence gender important influence among one dimension technology effectiveness measured performance efficiency tool user satisfaction
Interestingly among cognitive style dimension sensing thinking type outperformed intuitive feeling type
Finally among personality dimension introvert performed better extrovert efficiency dimension difference performance satisfaction
Thus clear stream research examined influence individual psychological variable user performance acceptance technology lends support idea user situational variable important determinant
There parallel innovation diffusion literature examined characteristic inherent tool innovation role technology acceptance
Clearly individual characteristic important however dearth theoretical model link perspective understanding nature technology acceptance
While finding user acceptance psychological construct shed light force determine individual behavior enable researcher predict accuracy user respond given application need address acceptance outset technology development prior investing development cost
Furthermore even individual user acceptance could assessed clear implementation use issue organizational level composite individual utility ease use rating EASON
In present section review literature explores issue inform design development process information technology ensure least increase acceptance resulting artifact
The system perspective become influential analysis organizational impact technology

Moving beyond concern one user interface system theory argues network social relationship surround working practice cooperation among worker course task supervisory relationship general social interaction ARGYLE
The gainful employment technology hinge ability willingness user employ worthwhile task deemed central organization goal
Accordingly technology analyzed understood isolation organization intended support
In order jointly optimize social technical attribute organization allowance must taken engineering level social dynamic organization within CHERNS
system theory given birth framework technology design emphasizes holistic job satisfaction rather task performance user participation throughout development process MUMFORD
Thus theorist recommend analysis stakeholder direct user technology formation planning group oversee design performance prototyping exercise analysis likely impact technology organization EASON
The intention design process avoid unpleasant side effect working practice ensure much social solution technical solution computing need organization
Though historically influential Europe Asia North America approach criticized researcher truly EHN
Concerns participant user may become victim groupthink time power making design decision resides management group theory take overly simplistic view job satisfaction aired recent critique PAIN ET AL
RAMSAY
However system approach pivotal shifting technology design away financial technical concern manifest traditional software development model waterfall model BOEHM towards perspective
In studying technology acceptance theorist EASON conceptualize acceptance term two competing force control enhancement
Control factor impose rule structure upon user thereby removing autonomy control action
According thinker working group autonomy encouraged since considered increase satisfaction performance
Among control issue raised respect technology design access reliability confidentiality monitoring pacing stress social contact
Low high presence certain factor low reliability high pacing introduction new technology likely reduce user perception control thus increase risk resistance
Enhancement factor include sense mastery growth knowledge discretion ability act informally requirement certain skill enabling worker cooperation
These factor maximized appropriate context though skill requirement inherent certain situation
A technology designed support factor likely increase user acceptance organization
Supporting evidence specific effect control enhancement variable acceptance information technology scarce though factor propose specific path research
thinker tend emphasize part holistic view organizational impact information technology must managed throughout design process
In proposing autonomy growth job satisfaction important value emphasis placed user participation design process task analysis usability evaluation planned introduction
Case study design introduction mark typical analysis information technology KLEIN EASON MARKUS rendering specific individual weighting control enhancement factor problematic
Recently HARTWICK BARKI reviewed research user participation concluded low correlation participation use mean
They proposed concept psychological involvement intervening variable relationship suggesting avenue research
While perspective gained currency literature several related approach design warrant mention
Though many share much basic emphasis organizational fit stakeholder influence acceptance frequently presented distinct approach literature
Perceived shortcoming treatment power relationship socio technical theory led emergence termed Scandinavian BAECKER ET AL Collective Resources Approach EHN
This theoretical perspective closely related indeed emerged partly development theory applied Sweden Norway practitioner
It distinguishable strong political perspective seek actively engage trade union equal partner planning work technology support

HCI research concentrated heavily concept usability term definition measurement DILLON NIELSEN
Though equivalent concept acceptance HCI researcher assume usable technology made greater chance proving acceptable user
To end many HCI researcher emphasize employing technique similar theorist user participation rapid prototyping interface use focus group trying design usable system GOULD thus blurring distinction many social science engineering research tradition interest developing humanly acceptable system
The concept usability evolved several stage definition
Though one may trace use back DE QUINCEY modern application information technology initially equated idea designing ease use HANSEN
Hence one may find definition usability term equivalent semantic expression user friendly STEVENS DU BOULAY ET AL
relationship presence absence certain interface feature window icon menu pointer SHNEIDERMAN
Neither approach proved sufficiently satisfactory given finding industrial practice DILLON ET AL
contextual dependency usability WHITESIDE ET AL
Recently probably field close link engineering manufacturing industry operational definition replaced semantic definition draft international standard usability proposed
According ISO pt
usability application refers effectiveness efficiency satisfaction specific user performing specific task specific environment use application
Such definition seen providing target set designer meet given context shift focus interface creation evaluation seeking understand usability
Consequently researcher developed tool measurement technique response definition supposedly enable usability engineering approach put practice throughout product development cycle BEVAN MACLEOD NIELSEN
One researcher make explicit link usability acceptability SHACKEL
According formulation acceptable system one appropriately satisfies requirement user utility usability cost
Utility refers range function provided technology activity enable user perform
Note utility construed DAVIS construct perceived usefulness outlined earlier chapter
Users may rate utility high intended use rating may equate objective measure utility derived formal task analysis DRURY ET AL
although context would almost certainly close correspondence
Usability refers extent user employ function effective efficient satisfactory manner cost
For one user organization variable may made user might willing sacrifice cost saving greater usability others might consider usability lesser importance compared financial outlay utility
Such conceptualization pose potential problem evaluation organizational term since end user frequently purchaser
As result perception cost impact acceptability equation likely drawn people providing measure usability perhaps even utility
Reconciling difference may prove problematic theoretically exists strong point contact usability engineering approach design
Furthermore differentiation data source suggests potential incommensurability usability engineering MIS approach acceptance
However operational definition usability framed within acceptability equation kind advocated SHACKEL offer pragmatic approach tackling acceptability
By performing task analysis agreeing utility need provided within system testing people use effectiveness efficiency satisfaction measure HCI approach provide mean measuring predicting acceptability explicitly
Within mainstream usability engineering pragmatic concern tend drive research base
This seen recent attempt understand relative value user based test expert evaluation NIELSEN usability evaluation term product development cost BIAS MAYHEW recently debate number user one need reliably identify problem system LEWIS VIRZI
LANDAUER make case extending type research arguing offer best hope advancing field technology design yield acceptable system
Usability engineering specialist like theorist seek influence complete process design approach somewhat distinct term relative emphasis place physical conceptual design interface
Although usability literature make reference organizational level issue GOULD major focus research recommendation design tend concentrate method technique developing user interface
This relationship inverted literature interface issue tend relegated hence attempt theorist EASON SHACKEL reconcile two
It concluded social scientist HCI researcher concerned user acceptance design stand opposition traditional information technology design practice
In many way design method form continuum technology centered designer methodologists existing extreme
BOEHM proposed spiral model software design stand sharp relief waterfall model place strong emphasis prototyping two major characteristic usability engineering method
Furthermore structured design method Structured Systems Analysis Design Methodology SSADM CUTTS Jackson Systems Design JSD JACKSON supposedly rigorous method ensuring logical design modified incorporate technique DAMODARAN case SSADM LIM ET case JSD user acceptance might directly tackled although success approach remains seen
The question user acceptance concern researcher procurer wish predict candidate technology prove suitable organization given design likely received user
As issue draw multiple theoretical perspective research topic diverse change management organization human attitude formation system analysis user interface design technology diffusion
Innovation diffusion theory provides general framework within social impact technology modeled seek provide insight characteristic group adopt technology different phase characteristic inherent technology may influence specific group adopt
However predicting one group user receive new technology province diffusion theory question better tackled within specific framework provided TAM
In seeking influence design technology maximize acceptance organizational analysis approach system theory enable planning work activity around technology manner minimizes resistance ideally maximizes potential user satisfaction development
Of many theory domain appears much overlap term socio technical system thinking generically applicable title commonality
Finally usability engineering affords mean factoring acceptance design interface user technology
By articulating concept least partially operationalized form usability engineering work field HCI offer pragmatic technique maximizing chance acceptability interface system individual user
Clearly approach offer something understanding issue user acceptance
At time appears little hope overarching theory encompass explanation prediction user acceptance well providing tool ensuring design process lead acceptable product
However terrain mapped research yield type answer still sought
In particular direct mapping TAM operational definition usability utility manifest HCI literature would useful clear whether HCI definition usability decomposed version TAM ease use
Clearly TAM offer tight theoretical linkage construct shown play important role user acceptance
However degree theoretical outline play important role actually guiding system design evaluated
On hand HCI conceptualization product acceptability usability grounded practice appears theoretical relationship usability element effectiveness efficiency satisfaction resolved
In part requires detailed examination extent three component ISO definition equally important
Certainly issue deserve direct empirical examination appears little evidence anyone tackled yet
This certainly fruitful area research
At extreme research negotiation criterion acceptability among participant organizational design context power structure technical competency mixed would also insightful go way bridge usability engineering acceptance predictability paradigm
Ideally theory inform practice vice versa thus understanding practical well theoretical problem associated technology acceptance remain important research domain

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue

In physicist Nobel laureate Albert Michelson declared science almost finished human race within hair breadth understanding everything It seems probable grand underlying principle firmly established advance sought chiefly rigorous application principle phenomenon come notice
Bold heady prediction like often seem destined topple sure world physic soon shaken revolution relativity quantum mechanic
But century unfolded turned phenomenon closest human scale biology social science economics politics among others notably eluded explanation grand principle
The deeper dig working society unexpected complexity find
Fittingly century science began bridge disciplinary boundary order search principle complexity
The study complexity refers attempt find common principle underlying behavior complex system system large collection component interact nonlinear way
Here term implies system understood simply understanding individual component nonlinear interaction cause whole sum Complex system scientist try understand collective sophistication come whether ant colony cell brain immune system social group economic market
People study complexity intrigued suggestive similarity among disparate system
All system exhibit system component organize act coherent whole without benefit central outside Complex system able encode process information sophistication available individual component
Complex system evolve continually changing way learn adapt time
Such system defy precise prediction resist kind equilibrium would make easier scientist understand
Of course important scientific discovery transform understanding nature I think study complexity go step help u understand important phenomenon change perspective think nature science
Here example surprising discovery Complex Systems science
If seem surprising perspective already changed science complexity
Why seem forecast weather farther week
Why hard project yearly variation fishery population
Why foresee stock market bubble crash
In past widely assumed phenomenon hard predict underlying process highly complex random factor must play key role
However Complex Systems science especially study dynamic chaos shown complex behavior unpredictability arise system even underlying rule extremely simple completely deterministic
Often key complexity time simple though nonlinear interaction rule among system component
It still clear unpredictability weather stock market animal population caused iteration alone study chaos shown possible
Above I reiterated old saw whole sum The physicist Phil Anderson coined better aphorism noted key lesson complexity Ant colony great example
As ecologist Nigel Franks put The solitary army ant behaviorally one least sophisticated animal army ant placed flat surface walk around around never decreasing circle die Yet put half million together group whole behaves superorganism sophisticated sometimes frightening collective More different
Similar story told neuron brain cell immune system creativity social movement city agent market economy
The study complexity shown system component right kind interaction global behavior system capacity process information make decision evolve learn powerfully different individual component
In early complete human genome sequenced
While benefit science enormous prediction made prominent scientist others Michelsonian flavor see first paragraph
President Clinton echoed widely held view Human Genome Project would revolutionize diagnosis prevention treatment human Indeed many scientist believed complete mapping human gene would provide nearly complete understanding genetics worked gene responsible trait would guide way revolutionary medical discovery targeted gene therapy
Now decade later predicted medical revolution yet materialized
But Human Genome Project huge progress genetics research followed uncover unexpected result
First human gene DNA sequence code protein number around much fewer anyone thought number mouse worm mustard plant
Second gene make DNA
Two mystery emerge If human comparatively gene complexity come
And DNA past dismissively called junk DNA function
What geneticist learned genetic element cell like ant colony interact nonlinearly create intricate network
It network rather individual gene shape organism
Moreover surprising junk DNA key forming network
As biologist John Mattick put The dismissed junk understood turn hold secret human network emerging core organizing principle biology
What used called cellular signaling pathway cellular information processing New research cancer treatment focused individual gene disrupting cellular information processing network many cancer exploit
Some type bacteria known communicate via quorum sensing network order collectively attack host discovery also driving research treatment infection
Over last two decade interdisciplinary science network emerged developed insight research method apply network ranging genetics economics
Network thinking area complex system perhaps done transform understanding world
In Nobel economist Paul Krugman said Few economist saw current crisis coming predictive failure least field problem
More important profession blindness possibility catastrophic failure market At least part blindness due reliance risk model based
A hypothetical normal distribution probability financial gain loss trading
A hypothetical distribution showing loss side
The tail distribution far side
The distribution predicts considerably higher probability catastrophic loss normal distribution
The term refers familiar bell curve
Economists finance professional often use distribution model probability gain risk loss investment
Figure show hypothetical normal distribution risk
I marked hypothetical catastrophic loss graph
You see given distribution risk probability loss would near zero
Less probable maybe lightning strike right standing
Something worry
Unless model wrong
The study complexity shown nonlinear highly networked system accurate estimation risk would distribution
Figure b show hypothetical distribution risk loss side shown
The longer tail far side distribution show probability catastrophic loss significantly higher system obeying normal distribution
If risk model employed rather normal distribution possibility extreme event catastrophic loss would judged likely
Because distribution known signature complex network growing understanding network implies risk model need rethought many area ranging disease epidemic power grid failure financial crisis ecosystem collapse
The technologist Andreas Antonopoulos put succinctly The threat complexity The new science complexity become catchphrase circle
Google report nearly hit phrase
But new study complexity
And extent actually science
The current scientific effort centered around complexity several antecedent
The Cybernetics movement General System Theory movement recent advent Systems Biology Systems Engineering Systems Science share goal Complex Systems science finding general principle explain behavior emerges interaction among component
The different movement capture different though sometimes overlapping community different focus attention
To mind Complexity refers single science rather community scientist different discipline share interdisciplinary interest methodology mindset address scientific problem
Just mindset consists hard pin
I would say includes first assumption understanding complexity require integrating concept dynamic information statistical physic evolution
And second computer modeling essential addition traditional scientific theory experimentation
As yet Complexity single unified science rather paraphrase William James still hope I believe hope great promise
In era Big Data Complexity potentially offer Big Theory scientific understanding complex process produce data drowning
If field past contribution indication Complexity big theory even profoundly transform understanding world
It something look forward
In word playwright Tom Stoppard It best possible time alive almost everything thought knew Anderson More different

Discussion Summary My elicited several comment reader
Like field complexity discussion ranged across many topic including question make system complex whether intrinsic randomness nature role DNA existence symbol brain several fascinating issue modern science
Many thanks people took time comment essay
I summarize highlight discussion
In essay I stressed importance nonlinear interaction among component complex system
I said nonlinear interaction cause whole sum One commenter asked role factor contributing complexity
Nonstationarity refers idea statistic underlying system change time
Complex system often exhibit nonstationarity also result nonlinear interaction
I would say nonstationarity probably viewed effect rather cause complexity system
My discussion unpredictability complexity system led one commenter asking fact intrinsic randomness unpredictability world unpredictability see complex system simply result lack knowledge
This important question also heart argument theoretical physic
Does quantum mechanic involve true randomness hidden variable whose invisibility mask actually deterministic universe
I think physicist today believe fundamental randomness quantum level existence chaos implies fundamental randomness principle amplified macroscopic level produce fundamental uncertainty complex system
But I say whether account uncertainty currently specific complex system nature
Another commenter asked relevance Kurt Gödel incompleteness theorem looking unified theory complex system
Does Gödel theorem preclude unified theory intrinsic limit deduction
My response scientific theory different mathematical theorem largely based
One scientific theory way one prof mathematical theorem
Scientific theory supported empirical evidence never definitively proved sense mathematical proof
In essay I mentioned notion system become complex risk catastrophic failure becomes higher
One commenter followed asking following Complexity science science today seems grab hold panoply tool computer bulging software toolbox collate regress smooth iterate animate graph color prettify data software many source data compiled computer according rule derived
At point work drawing many interdisciplinary people paper tool become complex depend The commenter go Is Complexity science certain point complexity This interesting question
My response Just complexity science study complexity mean science need complex
The goal course better understand system currently call Science always strives simple explanation cf
Occam razor science complex system exception
The science complexity successful show complexity nature explained simple common principle
There famous quotation author unknown say something like I would give life simplicity side That simplicity I think science striving
Another commenter voiced opinion worry world becoming complex rather worry world become complex enough solve problem My favorite statement comment also last commenter
In essay I paraphrased William James Complexity yet science hope The commenter responded Complexity may hope science may hope I find emphasis nonlinearity complexity misplaced
Instead I would suggest nonstationarity bigger contributor complexity
Fred I good answer
Nonlinearity nonstationarity quite distinct idea though interplay
As I mentioned essay nonlinearity refers idea behavior whole system different would predict summing part
Nonstationarity refers idea statistic underlying system change time
The detail two notion get pretty technical
You certainly correct system call complex exhibit nonlinear interaction among componets behavior time
It hard say given system one bigger contributer complexity depends kind complexity talking
Of course hard talk idea without specific example system specific notion complexity
I sure say nonstationarity proxy population heterogeneity seems independent property system
Thanks Melanie
In prior response George mention parameter uncertainty leading unpredictable system
Heterogeneous population generate nonstationary summary statistic
In finance decidedly complex system shown first two moment distribution nonstationary
Various attempt improving estimation technique mainly resampling simulation yielded valid estimate
Thus leaving u great parameter uncertainty unfortunately unpredictable system
The question turn
We must look population estimating parameter
We certain homogeneous population statistic parameter army ant grain sand pixel per Bak et al
Thus system component exhibit nonlinear interaction variance parameter estimate complexity reduced tedious prediction made
We measure every individual population sample exhibit nonstationarity result artifact population heterogeneity responsible deviation desired certainty
More different seems speak additivity causal flow within system rather nonlinearity component
You right point system deserves treatment specific example specific notion generally nonstationarity primary focus address proxy population heterogeneity
Thanks response insight
I forgot mention one supporting point
The population heterogeneity issue I raise new
In economics Homo Economicus developed attempt homogenize population axiomatic assumption decision theory
It George Nice hear devoured book I hope tasty
The question determinism still hotly debated philosophy physic circle
Quantum physic seems say fundamental randomness world people disagree
The argument get pretty technical I usually follow
Interestingly mathematics chaos tell u real world determinism imply predictability
That completely deterministic system famous logistic map whose mathematics understand perfectly certain value parameter system uncertainty current state system matter small uncertainty system predictable
To astounding result
Of course touch touchy subject free
Fortunately I philosopher I argue one way
I sure mean math descriptive prescriptive
Maybe clarify
As Godel theorem I personally think relevant science
Godel theorem tell u axiomatic system arithmetic consistent true statement proved within system
This might bad news mathematician though one know mathematical statement care limitation
In short Godel theorem possible limit deduction
I think much science deduction proving theorem
It inductive endeavor
We create model account data
We try find simplest model good predicting phenomenon try understand mechanism
There proof model correct verified showing work data seen far
In short induction deduction way science work
Thanks reply
Yes book tasty left hungry
Hello Melanie thank introduction complexity course inspiring read listen someone knowledge still kept alive genuine curiosity

Can identify way way thinking changed Complex Systems science
It made feel good
How
Well It allowed know many people working question issue I consider contemporary I consider next step science I even found answer along year automaton hierarchy computational complexity class great binnacle struggle tackle complexity perhaps century ok wonder earth shape today complexity ubiquitous complexity surrounded human made complex system know complex system Internet implemented understood way layer citing Gregory Chaitin could recognize natural DNA software invent artificial software discovered complex system see everywhere instrument tool allow u see differently tool hammer make every problem nail telescope allow u see far vision computer allow u see far thought
It amazing people Philip Warren Anderson could foresaw layered model unavoidable today seen internet working
Complexity science interesting already theory practice address question arise today watching around everyday system nature least anyone interested life knowledge limit

The discussion stated system get intricately networked threat complexity
The network scientist Duncan Watts suggested notion big fail rethought complex Should worry world becoming complex
If
I think trust future bring ethical action everything accept mistake never give ethic word action may seem extent large complexity taught u thing little thing

To extent think idea complex system new
What would take create unified science complexity
As I wrote new idea old one mainly visible issue idea capable foresee
I think already ingredient tool need What Newton Physics I
time take time complexity issue
Hernan Thank much thoughtful response discussion question
I enjoyed reading
I think definition complexity pertinent great thing another definition pertains mundane thing
The definition applies mundane thing would thing focus relationship
If one member perturbed member step fill gap left first
A house card sand dune weather front would
These thing require vast computer resource model could well worth modeling mundane
For vibrant complexity biological cell entire category address radically different mundane analysis required perceive relationship
For participant high system analysis must functionally hand order system function highly
The basis high system especially life process would fall within vibrant complexity
As turn vibrant complexity kind effectively understood
This nominally surprising make better sense one considers high system indeed thrust direction begin
Then one also considers people similarly endowed make sense analysis since simply matter
Not science task presently practiced since science thrall mathematics since Newton announced calculus
But understanding vibrant complexity available simple electrifying
It also powerful
Very excruciatingly powerful
I telling picture one might consider
Vibrant complexity discernible discernment available
This hooray
Okay would crummy leave
I put way eight word statement reveals whole analysis
The core eight word though may necessary spend time heart looking
The eight word A sentence composed noun verb
Equivalently A noun verb compose sentence
From vibrant complexity fall open like book
Your distinction mundate vibrant complexity interesting
I wondering largely overlapping complex system adaptive adapt
This distinction complex system community make
Some people go far include adaptation list requirement complex system
Your contrasting phrase seem imply difference passive active constructed something outside oneself actively constructing oneself
I use vibrant complexity refer system internal definition something involves component direction cooperate pursue
Hence biological analogy cell
A mundane complexity something swirl tumble forth may quite important model internally defined course concourse
The vibrant system would inherently adaptive mundane would merely tumble different cliff given choice B instead choice A
The whole point excitement vibrant system precisely internal definition locus member cooperate system real extent discerned
Especially poignant system discerned everything far vaster system one give u biology
So pertain u draw experience insight discern
A double victory
The distinction phrase merely rewording statement emphasis robustness
The point phrase exact key entirely vibrant complexity extreme power bivalence represented bivalence noun But I present concept instance grammatical sentence bold elegant introduction
A picture rather thousand word
Hi Melanie I familiar work Ralph Stacey I give informed opinion
Certainly human organization complex system I sympathetic focus interaction way understanding organization
I also like observation strategic mangement distinct organizational dynamic
There number people used idea complex system science thinking organizational dynamic sense referring I know much area
I would certainly include psychology sociology field whose perspective changing due idea complex system
Sociologists especially think network work coming network science directly relevant question sociology
I note Plexus Institute refers Ralph Stacey I think manager interact enough scientist vice detriment mgt
conscript propose creating small quantum device record ever visual action human event happening get exactness measure create computer program language handle shorter segment time versus exact movement recorded medium
Yoccatosec laser fasters use compare event speed light
My quantum computer ascribed theory chaos modified data base founded actual real life event video extract
I use augmented reality glass type sun glass design visual controlled
I actually get real mathematically tested experiment
And DNA past dismissively called junk DNA function As post would like orient I coming clarify discussion defined way
Essentially field biologist age yr
older hope knowledgeable
As retired medical professional postdoc degree always interested Big Questions worked area science year reason among others
My approach Structuralism More different written welcome see key principle
I like take thing specific general good existing scientific example showing relationship
Alexander Kuhn The Structure Scientific Revolutions give great example structuralist approach answering Big Questions
We knew junk DNA MUST function one big reason
The Least Energy Principle LEP
This enormously important principle universe everything seems abide way another
To paraphrase MH Encyclopedia Science Tech LEP provides mean solving problem otherwise intractable
Let apply
So called junk DNA junk cell much
That much DNA cost LOT energy resource create maintain
That would violate LEP
So Must somethings
Complex system thinking show part complex system function way
A B linear complex
A B C D others found multiple function defined cell receptor site good real example complex system work
This characteristic complexity underlies almost biology
This recently found one part answer junk DNA
It probably lot one piece answer
The entire article interesting scroll paragraph titled make evolutionary sense
Because part junk DNA regulates expression gene creates greater diversity possible simple gene expression
Taking specific example dominantly inherited gene incomplete expression diabetes paranoid related disorder see
Diabetes family traced back generation died ca
death certificate Missouri
The dominant gene continued family generation next
BUT important point always expressed age force
Some get simple oral hypoglycemic agent
Others must use insulin control blood sugar
get
But interestingly study twin AODM adult onset diabetes gene one twin get diabetes within well
It probability certainty another complex system characteristic
It NOT linear determinism
The true paranoid disorder genetics dominant gene closely associated full blown schizophrenia also real bipolar disorder without schizophrenia
This complexity nutshell
contrast diabetic geneiics twin study ID twin get schizophrenia twin chance coming
carried gene might get either disorder often unsuspected passing carrier state
How complexity
But point let apply one important characteristic evolutionary model
If gene survive must something enable possessor survive
It must advantage
If gene usual state regulating certain metabolic effect due concentration substance creating feedback effect gene one control insulin production responds high blood sugar simple gene expression
But single gene expressed many way addition metabolic regulatory effect organism gotten LOT room adapt environment
The epigenetic effect junk DNA actually INCREASE diversity organism potential response beyond simple genetic expression
And THAT may junk DNA preserved passed
When genetic diversity increased increase chance survival
So using evolutionary principle understand junk DNA epigenetics
Do see using complex system characteristic simplify vast amount data preferred method linear thinking
This example process thinking using characteristic complex system combined real example
It specific go directly real existing example higher abstraction LEP genetic diversity survival characteristic complex system characteristic using real existing example
It creative work
It valid useful method
using evolutionary principle AODM prevalent society
If kill shortens lifespan often markedly much gene population
An answer question even interesting topic
This somewhat rigorous concrete approach method
suggests many professional think within complex system model
Thanks comment
I agree much say bring really fascinating area
One thing I disagree If gene survive must something enable possessor For example understanding gene function maladaptive function able hitchhike along useful gene
I think incorrect assume every gene every phenotypic trait matter adaptive purpose
By way layperson interested genetic network function DNA I found Sean Carroll book Endleess Forms Most Beautiful The New Science Evo Devo great introduction area
Highly recommended
Donald Wilhelm Thanks comment
I guess agree disagree
That I agree classical AI think agree representation brain
Having representation culture allows precision
Since access culture vocal action need second set representation brain
Especially since brain limitation leading theory sparse representation pinpoint accurate
The muscular algorithm also explains consciousness qualia since perception action separate
This Einstein method rethink assumption
In case assumption language symbolic
Hi Melanie Thank wonderful article introduction complexity course
For think way complexity unify way thinking reductionism holism
More specifically study system Let call S reductionism emphasizes property basic component Let call property R holism emphasizes emergent property system Let call property H
What complexity science study tell u First neither R H complete characterization S Second H different R More different
Third studying S R dynamic interaction could fully understand system
If agree view I would say idea complexity science complex system new
The concept Yin corresponding R Yang corresponding H Daoist philosophy describes exactly dynamic interaction R What would take create unified SCIENCE complexity
To answer question may first ask unified science complexity Let call exists would expect
Should help u understand ant colony cell brain immune system social group economic market
If relationship scientific discipline specialized individual system
Following way thinking described paragraph I would like say subsume current scientific discipline component never replace discipline
In another word would complex system emerging creative interaction established scientific discipline
So
Obviously encourage support crossing discipline study
And exactly founder Santa Fe Institute The Cowan Collaborative mind embrace idea Open Data Open Science give support anyone want crossing discipline study
This turn would create positive feedback open science
Should worry world becoming complex
My answer NO
Instead I would like say worry world become complex enough solve problem facing
Joseph Tainter work Problem Solving Complexity History Sustainability explained point well
Above Complexity may hope science may hope science
Best Zeta Hello Zeta I really enjoyed reading comment
I especially like idea Science emergent complex system component science
I also like hope science notion
I take look book Tainter
Thank
If Humain Being please tell create humain simple method
Firstly shoud know human person
But maybe think never create person like u
The author writes Complexity refers single science rather community scientist extent actually science scientific understanding
Do know anymore science scientist scientific understanding
As year pas definition ever expanding becoming looser le definable probabilistic
What science scientist understanding
Complexity science science today seems grab hold panoply tool computer bulging software toolbox collate regress smooth iterate animate graph color prettify data software many source data compiled computer according rule derived
At point work drawing many interdisciplinary people paper tool become complex depend
In word find ant colony depend reason true
When ladder built rung different source fastened different manner different worker become undependable
The ladder might reach roof hold weight heavy roofer
Is Complexity science certain point complexity
What supercede Complexity science
Dear My response Complexity science study complexity mean science need complex
The goal course better understand system currently call complex
Science always strives simple explanation cf
Occam razor science complex system exception
The science complexity successful show complexity nature explained simple common principle
There famous quotation author unknown say something like I would give life simplicity side complexity
That simplicity I think science striving

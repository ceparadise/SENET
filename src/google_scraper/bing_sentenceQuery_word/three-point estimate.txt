Estimation look three value There confusion regarding Estimation PERT industry
However technique different
You see difference learn two technique
Also end PERT technique difference collated presented
If want look first
Estimate E based simple average follows triangular distribution
In Triangular Distribution Mean O plus M plus L Standard Deviation O E plus M E plus L E Arrive WBS
For task find three value optimistic estimate O likely estimate M pessimistic estimate L
Calculate Mean three value
Calculate Estimate task
Estimate Mean
Hence Calculate Standard Deviation task
Repeat Steps Tasks WBS
Calculate Estimate project
Calculate Standard Deviation project
The Estimate E Standard Deviation SD thus calculated used convert project estimate Confidence Levels
The conversion based Commonly Confidence Level E Value plus SD used project task estimate

key role come subject Project Management
Effort estimation valuable though accurate
That involved original assessment calculated overall projection
When talking relate Project Management look closely three distinct area
What outcome likely
When take n selected consideration going certain type know
For example estimate productive something based schedule activity
You also need factor variable control though
There doubt arise complicate natural flow thing
Take close look best possible outcome event
This going viewed attitude someone optimism
These going show occur everything go right process actually
Next want take close look worst possible outcome event
You want pessimist go angle nothing going go well
What worst happen absolutely everything could possibly go wrong
Using area Estimates get realistic Project Management result
One formula take average get three possibility considered
However sophisticated approach
p optimistic estimate likely estimate p pessmistic estimate
As example developer estimate part code would need day optimistically day likely day pessimistically estimate would day
This estimate going accurate get hope one possibility one actually take place
This term defined edition
hi sitting class searched find site beautiful way defining
Fabulous good

Meet Hailey
Hailey manager Jewelry R Us
On average Jewelry R Us completes four project month without real issue
But lately company struggling get three done month
Jewelry R Us always scheduled four project four different customer month
But fail complete four project one customer month getting project completed lead upset
Hailey know going continue keep current customer gain new one team better estimating many project realistically complete month
Hailey decides use technique called three point estimating help improve estimate
tool company use help increase accuracy cost time estimate
Like name implies three part three different estimate
For example Hailey completing project making necklace following estimate might given Optimistic All supply come early Pessimistic None supply come time Most likely The supply take normal amount time come You may wondering estimate work
What step
Let take look

Discussion The first step meet team discus may encounter would make project take longer could occur may result project taking le time
This allows Hailey team member voice concern everyone aware blamed project take longer scheduled

Estimates The next step making estimate
This mean making estimate crucial step project
Hailey know need optimistic pessimistic likely estimate

Calculate When estimate plug formula
Where E estimate optimistic estimate likely estimate p pessimistic estimate Where SD standard deviation p pessimistic estimate optimistic estimate Get FREE access day create account
Using example earlier Hailey team making necklace let calculation
We already know following Now let add number estimate term many day take get supply
Let assume Now plug number E E E day And SD SD SD day So best estimate day supply come deviation number anywhere day earlier day later
technique us three estimate better understand duration cost activity
The three estimate worst case scenario best case scenario mostly likely occur
To complete estimate need discus estimate calculate

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I want establish estimate following n
Would following correct
n
O n O Therefore dominant term appears derive n
would give u O
Would correct
Yes right
For correct Big O estimate expand find dominant term simplify take big O estimate intermediate step
In expression dominant term
say O
You could even say expression O n somewhat simpler tighter
If comfortable advanced math use n
n n e O leading dominant term n simplifying
Your dominating term indeed n
However I would write bound differently
In particular n n n n n n
By slightly abusing notation often common write O n instead last expression

Please note fee structure Masters program US university based number credit hour would required complete order graduate program
The total number credit hour required differs person person
There standard number credit hour opt per semester accordingly calculate amount would requiring
Please consult site order know fee structure Students usually advised opt credit hour per semester
You usually complete required number credit hour semester
year
You might require extra credit hour order complete project
So would need count factor
Students also advised opt staying rented room rather staying hostel dormitory becomes little bit expensive
Consulting link I provided looking USD time equaling USD per year tuition
Rents Meals would extra
So make INR year tuition
Double get INR
That cost semester tuition
Rooms Meals extra
Hence expect spend around INR lac Masters program
Please note rate bound change consecutive year
They usually increased per annum
The rate shown session
Good Luck

What difference estimate PERT estimate
PERT us weighted average likely whereas estimate really average three estimate
PERT us average model predict likely duration time cost whereas estimate us straight average duration cost
PERT estimate actually model
PERT used time cost estimate whereas estimate used time

By Regardless technique use tendency project estimation provide one number estimate
In word activity schedule activity would one estimate associated
This generally viewed likely many case accurate applying simple PERT Program Evaluation Review Technique model
PERT estimating technique us weighted average three number see come final estimate
The resulting PERT estimate calculated O P
This called weighted average since likely estimate weighted four time much two value
You notice final PERT estimate moved slightly toward either optimistic pessimistic value depending one furthest likely
Generally end moving final estimate toward worst case since worst case value tends likely optimistic number
For example let say estimate piece work likely take hour
The best case everything go right six hour
The worst case everything go wrong hour
The PERT estimate
The answer hour
Notice number pulled little toward far extreme pessimistic estimate much since result still weighted heavily toward likely value
You use PERT estimate two way
You provide three estimate activity schedule use PERT formula activity high risk
These one really sure estimate wide variation optimistic pessimistic value
Speaking variation subtract pessimistic value optimistic value divide result six would standard deviation measure volatility estimate
In example standard deviation would
The larger standard deviation le confidence estimate since would mean large range optimistic pessimistic estimate
If standard deviation small would mean pretty confident estimate since optimistic pessimistic estimate would close
Remember PERT formula use make estimate high level uncertainly

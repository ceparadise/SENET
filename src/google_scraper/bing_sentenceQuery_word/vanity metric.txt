Radio National Background Briefing recently presented identity theft shambolic conference exploitation sham peer review pseudoscience
Presenter Hagar Cohen provided introduction predatory academic publishing conference particular focus publisher
It also human story including researcher travelling across globe find attending imitation academic conference
Why predatory vanity academic publisher conference exist
Why flourishing
And tell u failing academia
Publish perish simplification academic life contains element truth
There little point undertaking research tell anybody true century
Four century ago astronomer discussed observation calculation method book
Understandably academic publication publication conference presentation become metric academic performance
One argue fact modern academic life
Peer review manuscript academic also critical academic publishing
Does manuscript add body knowledge
Does manuscript accurately discus previous work
Are significant error manuscript
Does manuscript clearly communicate relevant method result argument
Are conclusion manuscript justified
Peer review prevents many dubious manuscript published
It effectively excludes author unwilling unable meet standard mainstream academic publishing
Both vanity predatory academic publisher exploit opportunity created legitimate peer review academic performance metric
In particular allow author publish article would never survive legitimate peer review
Vanity academic journal existed decade imitation legitimate journal often promote particular discredited idea strong ideological bias
For example may sound respectable publishes pseudoscience including denial climate contrarianism scaremongering
More recently explosion predatory journal seek make large profit publishing fee virtually anything come way
While predatory publisher claim article often sham
For example Background Briefing I discussed published OMICS journal
This article supposedly based observation scientific methodology
Instead make claim alien based ancient Indian scripture mathematical language long forgotten mankind
To blunt nonsense
While academic ignore dubious journal publication impact beyond academia
The vanity Journal Cosmology often publishes credulously repeat
I also seen activist predatory journal attempt bolster argument
Predatory publisher often exploit goodwill legitimate academic
Being invited present conference edit journal usually evidence held high esteem peer
It opportunity good miss predatory publisher sting tail
Predatory publisher often invite academic join editorial board giving journal air legitimacy
However often ignore academic feedback manuscript even use academic name without permission
Similarly predatory outfit invite academic present conference hefty fee conference may pale imitation real conference
Background Briefing attended fewer attendee
Many speaker listed program attend
One wonder missing speaker even knew conference program
University Colorado librarian maintains list hundred produce thousand dodgy journal
Most publisher appeared past decade
This proliferation unfortunate side effect online
Online publication overhead printed journal require website correctly formatted PDF document
Conference venue across globe booked online credit card
Since requires computer many predatory publisher operate modest office suburban house
Traditionally journal available via subscription often considerable expense institution
Open access publication available everyone instantly potentially unlocks academic knowledge requires fee author funding agency remain viable
This open door predatory publisher seeking prise money author resulting thousand new suspect journal
Can vanity predatory publisher provide lesson academia
Clearly sector community including academia free shonky online operator
While would cute assume good bad publisher sometimes practice dodgy operator found elsewhere
published gibberish produced
publishes despite homeopathy
Academics must strive maintain improve academic standard including major publisher
It would also wrong assume functioning peer review simple arbiter right wrong
There spectrum peer review quality varying journal journal
Peer review process even best journal
That said knowingly avoid peer review submitting vanity predatory publisher effectively avoiding scrutiny rigour
They deliberately avoiding needed advance knowledge understanding

MarketBeat recently crossed subscriber mark
We send newsletter per month marketing email per month people time
We also secondary list subscriber receive weekly newsletter
In total send million email every month subscriber base
While sharing big round number entrepreneurship conference might impress stranger total number subscriber email marketer list important
Vanity metric business number almost always get larger time go little say business actually
These thing like total number people gone website lifetime sale product
They might make feel good keep investor happy provide useful information business right
Vanity metric dangerous success company create false appearance business well
The number total subscriber mailing list classic vanity metric
The number almost always go time provide meaningful information engaged email subscriber kind revenue creating
You could two different email list number subscriber perform differently
One list might consistently get open rate bounce
The might get open rate bounce rate
Both email list exactly size first list generate substantially revenue interest subscriber
Email marketer stop focusing total list size instead focus metric demonstrate list growth subscriber engagement revenue generation
By focusing three area much useful actionable information demonstrate email list actually performing whether helping achieve business goal
Here metric email marketer track When start focus actionable metric email marketing campaign start make different decision
A month ago I gotten subscriber
However people mailing list opened single email year
I decided remove subscriber list without second thought engaged content creating business value
They actually costing per year keep mailing list probably hurting overall deliverability
Even though removing subscriber meant list would drop subscriber subscriber one day actually best decision business
Focus seven metric listed monthly basis
Watch change time
Keep trying improve seven metric month working form creating compelling content subscriber writing good sale copy offering relevant useful product service
Forget total subscriber count start focusing metric matter
Great tip Matt
Not mention number inflated anyways I tried Unsubscribe email time yet continue receive
Please stop

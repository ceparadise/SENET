Very simple question
What term mean general
I put context must seed random function
Most random function common personal computer random deterministic degree
The function starting point upon future value based
This useful debugging purpose keep seed execution execution get number
To get number random different seed often used execution execution
This often based time machine
This method completely different generating random number based sort physical property world around u
Lava lamp sun spot two property observed generate random number
Anyone hit get real random number truly neccessary like poker website
If good generator folk attempt figure generator work predict future number
It mean pick place start
Think pseudo random number generator really long list number
This list circular eventually repeat
To use need pick starting place
This called seed
Seeding random function prevents giving sequence random number
Think start random generator
number generator use seed seed determine starting point sequence
Some always make sequence others produce different sequence depending seed
Some use cascade simple RNG given simple seed run produce complex seed masterpiece RNG
It quite useful able deliberately repeat sequence developing program one wish reproduce previous result
However imagine card game
It obviously good idea always deal sequence card

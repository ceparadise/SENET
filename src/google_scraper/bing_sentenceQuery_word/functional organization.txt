The major component level subsystem functional unit correspond particular hardware piece
Computer organization deal hardware component computer system include device central processing unit storage primary memory device
Notably many people find difficult distinguishing computer organization computer architecture significantly related
Essentially computer architecture refers engineering consideration useful coming desirable computer design

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

All business organization style management regardless government agency organization capital business
There different organization type system structure manage authority employee task
One type organization
Growing may noticed different friend family
They different system handling chore allowance could always tell charge anyone
Some family open policy decision made entire family calm meeting let call Family
Some family however told structure let call Family
The strict family strong household structure everyone knew place everyone knew charge every situation
The strict household would one parent firm authority figure home possibly sole making responsible financial decision family vacation allowance final punishment
While second parent look toward first parent leadership would responsible managing upkeep house authority child
It parent make sure child school homework behaving
At first sign misbehavior second parent would responsible deciding initial punishment first parent got home
The child looked leadership
The oldest sibling managed younger child middle child managed youngest youngest got say
In business world strict family would considered perfect example organization
characterized classical organizational structure leadership performed hierarchy approach employee leader answer one sole person authority
As saw strict family structure one leader made final decision yet second parent leadership role well child
The child turn leadership based age
This considered hierarchical chain command word leadership start top work way
Where else seen type structure
The military perfect example large functional organization work
There one main commander platoon captain soldier platoon obey however captain getting order another leader getting order someone even higher authority
You may recognize example leadership past job experience
In business atmosphere functional organization CEO executive director several department communication IT customer service director staff
The staff responsible task may even group leader responsible making sure team delivers assignment department director received order executive director received order CEO
What talking structure functional organization
Get FREE access day create account
organization operates employee work group divided seniority employee given direct task according skill set
Take previously mentioned business example
A business type management structure would clear role employee
There employee confusion task level authority expected
For example business may communication department handle writing article posting social medium creating original graphic
In department likely editor graphic designer writer
Each one specific role job perform
The writer know take responsibility graphic design completing edits writer department
In structure much room creativity sharing task
An employee would need leave position apply another position order take different assignment different department
Before employee even however would need get permission department director ask executive director ask CEO
Do see pattern
Maybe chart help A functional organization common find every sector business world
In functional organization authority leadership carried process think functional organization structure similar strict family one parent family member know role
Functional organization structured team every employee department director know exact role exactly must report one clear leader charge every one

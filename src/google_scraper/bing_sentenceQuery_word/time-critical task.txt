In computer programming task basic unit programming control
Depending operating system defines task design unit programming may entire successive invocation program
Since one program may make request program utility program may also considered task subtasks
All today operating system support allows multiple task run concurrently taking turn using resource computer
In task may assigned priority depending relative importance amount resource consuming factor
The operating system preempt cut short task lower priority value higher priority task given turn
example operating system use preemptive multitasking
ability operating system manage multiple task application program time without ability necessarily preempt
It easy confuse term

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

significant unit AFT ER D Foundations Effective Teaching one widely discussed concept among researcher administrator educator since
This discussion actually began John Carroll paper A Model School Learning directly linked learning time
He proposed true learning depends amount time student spends actively engaged learning process compared amount time student need order learn
For example Bill need minute recognize know ten new sight word able type word per minute error spends minute learning Bill master material
Bill learn half word type half speed make error
Later research study amplified concept
These study explored time efficiently used classroom instructional practice lead active student learning
The California Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study BTES grade large number elementary school identified teaching activity classroom condition advanced student learning
BTES finding highlighted three important time concept
total amount time available learning
length school day class period
It opportunity learn
According BTES many subsequent study teacher allocate time specific content area student achieve higher level teacher allocate le time content
The Florida Department Education FLDOE embraced research concept developed policy mandated uninterrupted minute reading block public elementary school
This standardized reading time allocation guarantee elementary student equal opportunity learn read
The BTES study also noted factor limit learning cause student lose interest allocated timeframe The BTES finding demonstrate engaged time student higher achieve
Highly interactive instructional style led greater amount student engaged time consequently increased student learning
The Time Task unit ER D Foundation course offer data BTES study reading mathematic instruction This research found way many many teacher evaluation system promote interaction support student learning
Highly effective teacher use interactive presentation modeling question answer guided practice constructive feedback student work independently
It also interesting note high student engagement instruction group work yielded high engagement independent seatwork
quality amount time student spend actively working task appropriate difficulty
Success breed success
When teacher target instruction new concept skill student succeed least time student engaged achieve higher level
Computer game maker use research concept
They create captivating game designed advancing level difficulty even novice player intrigued challenge find ring enter magic door frequently enough maintain interest
For teacher striking balance challenge success classroom demanding complex game particularly heterogeneous group student
To deliver lesson designed maximize academic learning time teacher must How task research play classroom experience
Along school management practice ensure quality classroom time depends good classroom management process highly interactive teaching style
Four significant classroom management process promote What practical way using information
In Robert Marzano identifies explains four step work well variety curriculum area classroom setting promote
They Students require explanation curricular aim learning goal
For example teacher want student able perform oral presentation ass skill student need able use evaluation rubric containing four criterion
The teacher would lecture meaning rubric four factor apply factor ass presentation
It often helpful student see would look like actually mastered learning goal
It helpful student see someone necessarily teacher model successful use skill knowledge
Demanding learning goal require assistance practice
Teachers need include number instructional activity student practice guidance feedback
At point student display genuine mastery learning goal
Engaged especially relevant
Independent practice make sure student apply knowledge skill variety circumstance deeply understood
Innovative educator use many interactive strategy first three step particularly guided practice
Here annotated list interactive teaching strategy In conclusion time important learning

In describes system subject constraint example
program must guarantee response within specified time constraint often referred deadline
The correctness type system depends temporal aspect well functional aspect
response often understood order millisecond sometimes microsecond
A system specified operating real time usually response within timeframe although response time may given
A system described one control environment receiving data processing returning result sufficiently quickly affect environment time
The term also used mean simulation clock run speed real clock mean without significant delay
software may use one following network provide essential framework build software application
Systems used many application must control aircraft vehicle must produce maximum deceleration intermittently stop braking prevent skidding
processing completed within specified deadline relative event deadline must always met regardless
The term derives use early process simulated rate matched real process called avoid ambiguity
often capable simulating much faster pace situation could dangerous slow simulation also recognized accounted
Minicomputers particularly onwards built dedicated DOG scanner increased need response important interaction incoming data operating system RTOS well date era
scheduling allowed low priority task CPU time foreground task needed execute gave absolute priority within foreground highest priority
operating system would also used multiuser duty
For example could run foreground background RDOG would introduce additional element scheduling algorithm make appropriate people interacting via
Once used later used popular anybody could use home computer system
The possibility deactivate interrupt allowed loop defined timing low allowed implementation operating system giving user interface disk drive lower priority thread
Compared Intel CPUs generates large latency Windows operating system neither operating system allow program take CPU completely use without using native machine language thus surpassing interrupting Windows code
However several coding library exist offer real time capability high level language variety operating system example
The subsequent family member etc
also became popular manufacturer industrial control system
This application area one control offer genuine advantage term process performance safety
A system said total correctness operation depends upon logical correctness also upon time performed
system well deadline classified consequence missing deadline Thus goal ensure deadline met goal becomes meeting certain subset deadline order optimize criterion
The particular criterion optimized depend application typical example include maximizing number deadline met minimizing lateness task maximizing number high priority task meeting deadline
Hard system used imperative event reacted within strict deadline
Such strong guarantee required system reacting certain interval time would cause great loss manner especially damaging surroundings physically threatening human life although strict definition simply missing deadline constitutes failure system
For example control system hard system delayed signal may cause engine failure damage
Other example hard embedded system include medical system heart industrial process controller
Hard system typically found interacting low level physical hardware
Early video game system vector graphic hard requirement nature graphic timing hardware
In context system normally priority driven scheduler
Other scheduling algorithm include ignoring overhead sufficient system load le
New overlay scheduling system assist managing large system mixture hard non application
Soft system typically used solve issue concurrent access need keep number connected system changing situation
An example software maintains update flight plan commercial flight plan must kept reasonably current operate latency second
Live system also usually soft violation constraint result degraded quality system continue operate also recover future using workload prediction reconfiguration methodology
In DSP process analyzed input generated output sample processed generated continuously time take input output set sample processing delay
It mean processing delay must bounded even processing continues unlimited time
That mean processing time per sample including greater sampling period reciprocal
This criterion whether sample grouped together large segment processed block processed individually whether long short
Consider example process requires second process second sound
However take second made DSP process
A common life analog standing line waiting checkout grocery store
If line asymptotically grows longer longer without bound checkout process
If length line bounded customer processed output rapidly average inputted process
The grocer might go business must least lose business make checkout process thus fundamentally important process
A signal processing algorithm keep flow input data output falling farther farther behind input
But delay output relative input bounded regarding process operates unlimited time signal processing algorithm even throughput delay may long
signal processing necessary sufficient live signal processing required
Live audio digital signal processing requires operation sufficient limit throughput delay tolerable performer using noticeable audience also directly watching performer
Tolerable limit latency live processing subject investigation debate estimated millisecond
bidirectional le m round trip twice unidirectional delay considered acceptable avoid undesired conversation
computing sometimes misunderstood accurate classification
For example massive executing scientific simulation may offer impressive performance yet executing computation
Conversely hardware software braking system designed meet required deadline performance gain obligatory
Furthermore network server highly loaded network traffic response time may slower case still succeed time hit deadline
Hence network server would considered system temporal failure delay etc
typically small compartmentalized limited effect catastrophic failure
In system beyond limit would often considered catastrophic application context
Therefore important requirement system predictability performance
Some kind software many fall either category
For instance chess program designed play tournament clock need decide move certain deadline lose game therefore computation chess program allowed run indefinitely moving
In case however high performance desirable work tournament chess program allotted time better move faster unconstrained chess program run sooner able move
This example also illustrates essential difference computation computation tournament chess program make decision next move allotted time loses fails scenario meeting deadline assumed necessary
indicative amount processing performed given amount time ability get done processing yield useful output available time
The term NRT refers time introduced automated transmission occurrence event use processed data display control purpose
For example display depicts event situation existed current time minus processing time nearly time live event
The distinction term near real time real time somewhat nebulous must defined situation hand
The term implies significant delay
In many case processing described would accurately described near
Near also refers delayed transmission voice video
It allows playing video image approximately without wait entire large video file download
Incompatible database common flat file database scheduled basis common data near
The distinction near varies delay dependent type speed transmission
The delay near typically order several second several minute
Several method exist aid design system example old successful method represents structure system

I left interview asked question
After reading answer I try adress simple correct one Data science form needed
Before Data Science trend people used work data called Business Analysts
Statisticians
Computer Scientists
Data analyst
Put More data title
Now called That
Somewhere along way recognized power data could bring
The volume velocity variety data needed people could handle sort data
Now basic problem arised people statistician able handle copious large amount data
While people Computer scientist able formulate proper analysis data get good value
This led term Data Scientist people explained many different way
One I like You need create Job Titles demand skill
And hence Rebranding took root
Skillset required Data Science position may vary lot based different organization
I like bifurcate Fundamental knowledge Tool based knowledge
To understand various algorithm
To understand various algorithm
To understand various algorithm
Scripting Development

Data Science way take Data driven Decisions

Data Science There lot addition happening nearly everyday field would require people read ad learn lot everyday
You need learn old algorithm This discourage people actually one thing attracts lot towards field
I feel fascinated kind learning opportunity scope domain

Data Science
Data Science Actually nobody quite know exact definition data Science
To give perspective made Drew Conway
Everyone opinion data science

Data Science Data science tagged particularly sexiest job century Hal Varian
I disagree
A lot time used data wrangling tuning mundane stuff
Although I would still call job
The possibility could data still endless
Data Science Getting insight data need creating hypothesis work towards disproving
And actually end getting disproved
There would issue data might take time resolve
You may go day without getting valuable valid hypothesis
What mean It would take time gain value data delve deadline

Paul PhD University British Columbia taught Geographic Information Systems statistic computer programming year
basic value fact
Note term considered plural scientific community data collected data collected however everyone follows sometimes see data used singular
Every task computer carry work data way
Without data computer would pretty useless
It therefore important understand represent organize data
This lesson look different type data used computer system represented digital form organized database
There two general way represent data analog digital
data continuous actual fact represents
data discrete broken limited number element
Nature analog computer digital
Many aspect natural world continuous nature
For example think spectrum color
This continuous rainbow infinite number shade
Computer system hand continuous finite
All data stored binary digit limit much data represent
For example color image computer limited number color number might large still finite
Consider example color bit detail
The first monitor display essentially text terminal single color
White text appeared black background
Newer monitor used color enough represent basic image still quite limited
Modern display million color look much natural
Still number color finite
Computer system work different type digital data
In early day computing data consisted primarily text number however modern day computing lot different multimedia data type audio image graphic video
But ultimately data type stored binary digit
For data type specific technique convert binary language computer interpret data using sens sight sound
We ca talk data without mentioning database
A organized collection data
Instead data list random order database provides structure organize data
One common data structure database table
A table consists row column
Each row typically called record column typically called field
This example simple database table customer
Each customer unique identifier Customer ID name telephone number field
The first row called header row indicates name field
Following header row record unique customer
While example simple easily imagine else might stored database
For example might store customer mailing address billing information history past purchase etc
For organization many thousand customer quickly becomes large database
To use large database effectively use database management system
A specialized software input store retrieve manage data
Get FREE access day create account
Now let consider difference data information
They related making distinction useful especially working computer system
Data basic value
They unstructured lack context
For example list text entry list number would considered data
Information help u answer question
In order data organized processed useful manner
For example list text number could list name customer list number could telephone number
Knowing data represent name belongs number give structure context data resulting information
The distinction data information useful depend perspective user
For example want make sale call list customer name phone number informative want know bought past type business large organization etc
So perspective list name phone number data need additional data get information really interested
Let review
basic value fact
Computers use many different type data stored digital format text number multimedia
Data organized database table database management system used work large database
A proper understanding data allows organize useful information

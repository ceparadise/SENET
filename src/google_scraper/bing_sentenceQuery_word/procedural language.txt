Procedural programming natural way telling computer computer processor language machine code procedural
It also referred structured modular programming
Procedural programming performed telling computer list instruction
Therefore procedural programming involves procedure implies step need followed complete specific task
For example read number add display specific message
Procedural programming quite straightforward efficient often begin program written common plain language applying logic actually writing code
The main feature procedural programming relatively easy read write program code maintain program code numerous procedure debugged separately
Furthermore large program divided smaller one data shared therefore reached point within program
Conclusively taking account main characteristic procedural programing sequential logic simplicity easy implementation compiler interpreter ability make use code program calling instead copying ease program flow tracked ability strongly modular structured definitely said procedural programming essential stepping stone towards learning programming skill
An algorithm defined set step performing task written implemented
An algorithm detail start known information specified problem use information reach solution

Applying correct syntax essential done properly program wo run
The syntax language greatly affect easy write read understand program
Syntax error usually occur program statement conform rule language
Therefore Syntax error occur parsing input code result grammatically incorrect statement
Some example syntax error misspelled keywords unmatched quotation mark missing semicolon illegal character input missing operator two operator row two statement line intervening semicolon unbalanced parenthesis misplaced reserved word etc
Semantic error occur form element statement correct element valid use
Semantic error normally detected compile time
Semantic error occur execution code parsed grammatically correct
These error statement constructed mean
Regular example sematic error thing incorrect variable type size variable subscript range specifying wrong number argument function using numeric variable name character variable valid reference

Nonprocedural language allows programmer focus rather
This language focus much individual process needed get conclusion rather way get conclusion
This nonprocedural language often referred declarative language
The opposite nonprocedural language procedural language focus much individual process needed writing programming code
Many common type programming language considered procedural language including FORTRAN JavaScript COBOL Java
Procedural language often referred imperative language due necessity take certain step get conclusion
Most time nonprocedural language considered language

I read Wikipedia article I still slightly confused
Could someone boil core
A functional language ideally allows write mathematical function
function take argument return value
If program executed function logically evaluated needed
A procedural language hand performs series step
There way transforming sequential logic functional logic called
As consequence purely functional program always yield input order evaluation mean uncertain value like user input random value hard model purely functional language
As everything else answer generalisation
The property evaluating computation result needed rather sequentially called known functional language actually universally lazy laziness restricted functional programming
Rather description given provides think different programming style distinct opposite category rather fluid idea
Basically two style like Yin Yang
One organized chaotic
There situation Functional programming obvious choice situation Procedural programming better choice
This least two language recently come new version embrace programming style
copied one line Factorial actually common example show easy create new operator Perl way would create subroutine
This feature ingrained Perl operator Rakudo implementation defined way
It also allows add multi candidate existing operator
This example also show range creation list reduction combined numeric infix multiplication operator
It also show put signature instead
You get away starting range multiply operator return called without argument In computer science functional programming programming paradigm treat computation evaluation mathematical function avoids state mutable data
It emphasizes application function contrast procedural programming style emphasizes change state
I never seen definition given elsewhere I think sum difference given fairly well programming focus programming focus Expressions value
A functional program expression value sequence instruction computer carry
Statements value instead modify state conceptual machine
In purely functional language would statement sense way manipulate state might still syntactic construct named statement unless manipulates state I would call statement sense
In purely procedural language would expression everything would instruction manipulates state machine
Haskell would example purely functional language way manipulate state
Machine code would example purely procedural language everything program statement manipulates state register memory machine
The confusing part vast majority programming language contain expression statement allowing mix paradigm
Languages classified functional procedural based much encourage use statement v expression
For example C would functional COBOL function call expression whereas calling sub program COBOL statement manipulates state shared variable return value
Python would functional C allows express conditional logic expression using short circuit evaluation test opposed statement
Scheme would functional Python everything scheme expression
You still write functional style language encourages procedural paradigm vice versa
It harder awkward write paradigm encouraged language
I believe programming approach problem
The first style would plan everything step solves problem implementing one step procedure time
On hand functional programming would emphasize approach problem divided solved creating function solve sub problem result combined create answer whole problem
Lastly Objective programming would mimic real world create inside computer many object somewhat unique characteristic interacts others
From interaction result would emerge
Each style programming advantage weakness
Hence something pure programming
purely procedural one way kind weird purely functional purely objective difficult impossible except elementary problem specially designed demonstrate advantage programming style hence call like pureness weenie D
Then style programming language designed optimized style
For example Assembly procedural
Okay early language procedural Asm like C Pascal Fortran I heard
Then famous Java objective school Actually Java C also class called subject another discussion
Also objective Smalltalk
In functional school would nearly functional considered impure Lisp family ML family many purely functional Haskell Erlang etc
By way many general language Perl Python Ruby
To expand Konrad comment As consequence purely functional program always yield value input order evaluation Because functional code generally easier parallelize
Since generally side effect function generally act argument lot concurrency issue go away
Functional programming also used need capable code correct
This much harder procedural programming easy functional still easier
Disclaimer I used functional programming year recently started looking I might completely correct
One thing I seen really emphasized modern functional language Haskell really first class function flow control explicit recursion
You need define factorial recursively Haskell done
I think something like perfectly idiomatic construction much closer spirit using loop using explicit recursion
Konrad said As consequence purely functional program always yield value input order evaluation mean uncertain value like user input random value hard model purely functional language
The order evaluation purely functional program may hard er reason especially laziness even unimportant I think saying well defined make sound like ca tell program going work
Perhaps better explanation would control flow functional program based value function argument needed
The Good Thing well written program state becomes explicit function list input parameter instead arbitrarily global state
So level
Each function ignore rest universe focus need
When combined function guaranteed work would isolation
uncertain value like user input random value hard model purely functional language
The solution input problem purely functional program embed imperative language using
In imperative functional language needed cheat pas state implicitly order evaluation explicit whether like
Because cheating forced evaluation parameter every function imperative language lose ability create control flow mechanism without macro code inherently thread safe parallelizable implementing something like undo time travel take careful work imperative programmer must store recipe getting old value back
whereas pure functional programming buy I may free
I hope sound like zealotry I wanted add perspective
Imperative programming especially mixed paradigm programming powerful language like C still totally effective way get thing done
except possibly respect memory usage cf
foldl foldl Haskell
Procedural language tend keep track state using variable tend execute sequence step
Purely functional language keep track state use immutable value tend execute series dependency
In many case status call stack hold information would equivalent would stored state variable procedural code
Recursion classic example functional style programming
To expand Konrad comment order evaluation Some functional language called Lazy Evaluation
Which mean function executed value needed
Until time function passed around
Procedural language step step step step say add right
In lazy evaluation would say add result never used never addition
If chance I would recommand getting copy project
Most idea lately become bandwagon expressed Lisp decade ago functional programming continuation closure garbage collection even XML
So would good way get head start current idea besides like symbolic computation
You know functional programming good good
It good everything
Some problem best expressed term question give differet answer depending asked
A functional programming identical procedural programming global variable used
Creighton In Haskell library function called simply idiomatic factorial would simply Procedural programming divide sequence statement conditional construct separate block called procedure parameterized argument value
Functional programming except function value passed argument function returned result function call
Note functional programming generalization procedural programming interpretation
However minority interpret functional programming mean quite different irrelevant major functional language except Haskell

In us change program
In much way express command imperative program consists perform
Imperative programming focus describing program operates
The term often used contrast focus program accomplish without specifying program achieve result
type imperative programming program built one procedure also termed function
The term often used synonym use procedure dramatic effect imperative program appear constructed
programming change localized procedure restricted explicit argument return procedure form
From onwards structured programming general promoted technique improve overall quality imperative program
The concept behind attempt extend approach
Procedural programming could considered step towards declarative programming
A programmer often tell simply looking name argument return type procedure related comment particular procedure supposed without necessarily looking detail achieves result
At time complete program still imperative since statement executed order execution large extent
The hardware implementation almost computer imperative
Nearly computer hardware designed execute native computer written imperative style
From perspective program state defined content memory statement instruction native machine language computer
imperative language use complex statement still follow paradigm
process also familiar concept similar style imperative programming step instruction physical world hold state
Since basic idea imperative programming conceptually familiar directly embodied hardware computer language imperative style
imperative paradigm perform operation information located memory store result memory later use
imperative language addition permit complex may consist combination evaluation assignment resulting value memory
Looping statement allow sequence statement executed multiple time
Loops either execute statement contain predefined number time execute repeatedly condition change
statement allow sequence statement executed condition met
Otherwise statement skipped execution sequence continues statement following
Unconditional branching statement allow execution sequence transferred another part program
These include jump called many language subprogram procedure call usually return next statement call
Early development introduction enabled construction program group statement declaration could treated one statement
This alongside introduction enabled complex structure expressed hierarchical decomposition simpler procedural structure
Many imperative programming language
The earliest imperative language machine language original computer
In language instruction simple made hardware implementation easier hindered creation complex program
FORTRAN developed IBM starting first major programming language remove obstacle presented machine code creation complex program
FORTRAN allowed named variable complex expression subprogram many feature common imperative language
The next two decade saw development many major imperative programming language
In late developed order allow mathematical algorithm easily expressed even served target language computer
carried imperative paradigm logical extreme statement relying purely command even extent making IF ELSE command independent connected intrinsic variable named TEST
attempt make programming syntax look like English
In developed created working
Wirth went design
For need team began designing project define requirement language
The specification first published revision
The saw rapid growth interest
These language imperative style added feature support
The last two decade century saw development many language
originally conceived released Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
Drawing concept another considered world first developed designed language based
Design began first implementation completed
In late notable imperative language drawing concept released released included MFC released respectively released released Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto released
Microsoft imperative core main target language run however Microsoft functional language also run

There hundred programming language use today
How know one learn first
How know one best IT field choice
Well I ca answer question
But start learning one top popular one
That way always able get job IT industry
Learning programming language easy rewarding
You lot question first
Just remember get help need
You find answer almost everything Google nowadays excuse failure
Also remember take year become expert programmer
Do expect get good overnight
Just keep learning something new every day eventually competent enough get job done This article cover top popular programming language ranked June
I added general review comment language listed
Remember personal opinion
Other IT professional might different opinion
us released Sun Microsystems
Java number one programming language today many reason
First language strong library reusable software component
Second program written Java run many different computer architecture operating system use JVM Java
Sometimes referred code even WORA write run anywhere
Third Java language likely taught university computer science class
A lot computer science theory book written past decade use Java code example
So learning Java good idea even never actually code
Java Strengths WORA popularity Java Weaknesses Slower natively compiled language compiled developed use UNIX operating system
Although designed portable nature C program must specifically compiled computer different architecture operating system
This help make lightning fast
Although C relatively old language still widely used system programming writing programming language embedded system
Strengths Speed Weaknesses Memory management difficult master compiled written update C Bjarne Stroustrup
It attempt C brings help larger project
Despite age used create wide array application game office suite
Strengths Speed Weaknesses older considered clumsy newer language Java C
us language originally developed create dynamic web page
At first even real programming language time eventually grew fully featured programming language
Although PHP much criticized past bit sloppy insecure pretty good since version came
It hard argue success
Today PHP popular language used write web application
Even English IT program currently using written PHP Strengths Web programming good documentation Weaknesses Inconsistent many way thing history bizarre security decision interpreted language developed Microsoft Corporation Windows platform
It evolving year seen direct descendant Microsoft old BASIC
Visual Basic good language scripting Windows application need power speed C
Strengths None
Weaknesses Only run Windows interpreted programming language written late intended general programming purpose
Python named snake actually Monty Python comedy group
Python characterized use indentation readability encouragement making developer similar thing similar way
Python used main programming choice Google Ubuntu
Strengths Excellent readability overall philosophy Weaknesses None compiled language written Microsoft
It open specification rarely seen platform
C conceived Microsoft premium language
It similar Java syntax nature
Strengths Powerful pretty fast Weaknesses Only really suitable Windows interpreted language
A strange one
Despite name nothing whatsoever Java
You rarely ever see language outside web browser
It basically language meant script behavior web browser used thing web form validation AJAX style web application
The trend future seems building complex application JavaScript even simple online game office suite
The success trend depend upon advancement speed browser JavaScript interpreter
If want correct real name programming language although almost nobody actually call
Strengths reliable way web programming Weaknesses really useful web browser interpreted language written
It characterized somewhat disorganized syntax make sense PERL programmer However lot veteran programmer love use every day primary language
year ago Perl popular today
What happened
A lot newer programmer even old Perl programmer switched language PHP Python Ruby
Perl perhaps still best language text processing system administration scripting
I personally recommend however primary programming language
Strengths text processing system administration Weaknesses strange syntax perhaps many way thing interpreted language written around
It one language world
Everything object Ruby even letter number method call
It great language learn love object
The negative love make bit slow even interpreted language
Strengths Perhaps world language Weaknesses superior object model come price namely speed Okay
Those top programming language use today personal comment
Remember opinion like nose everyone one smell If disagree please feel free email write opinion forum
Which programming language already know
Which one want learn
Why
Which language think best making banking software
Web page
Games
Text processing
Computer language FORTRAN COBOL popular much anymore
Why think lost popularity
Which language top think drop year
Which one gain popularity
I teach English young software developer
We use site regular basis
It useful

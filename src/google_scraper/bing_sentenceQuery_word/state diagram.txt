A type used related field describe behavior system
State diagram require system described composed finite number sometimes indeed case time reasonable
Many form state diagram exist differ slightly different
State diagram used give abstract description
This behavior analyzed represented series event occur one possible state
Hereby diagram usually represents object single class track different state object system
State diagram used graphically represent
This introduced book The Mathematical Theory Communication
Another source book Sequential Machines Automata Theory
Another possible representation
A classic form state diagram FA following element Q Σ Z δ q F The output function ω represents mapping ordered pair input symbol state onto output symbol denoted mathematically
For DFA NFA GNFA input denoted edge
For input output signified edge separated slash denotes state change upon encountering symbol causing symbol output
For state output usually written inside state circle also separated state designator slash
There also variant combine two notation
For example state number output
motor caution light diagram reflect
designates state output
This designator written inside state circle
state
Each edge labeled input
This example show acceptor string contain even number zero
state
Each edge labeled input output
gaining widespread usage since variant become part UML
The diagram type allows modeling activity part state
Classic state diagram require creation distinct node every valid combination parameter define state
This lead large number node transition node simplest system
This complexity reduces readability state diagram
With Harel statecharts possible model multiple state diagram within statechart
Each state machine transition internally without affecting state machine statechart
The current state state machine statechart defines state system
The Harel statechart equivalent state diagram improves readability resulting diagram
There set semantics available represent state diagram
For example tool modeling designing logic embedded controller
These diagram like Harel original state machine support hierarchically nested state orthogonal region state action transition action
Newcomers state machine formalism often confuse
The figure show comparison flowchart
A state machine panel performs action response explicit event
In contrast flowchart panel b need explicit event rather transition node node graph automatically upon completion activity
Nodes flowchart edge induced graph state
The reason node flowchart represents program command
A program command action executed
So state applied program state result transition another state
In detail source code listing represents program graph
Executing program graph parsing interpreting result state graph
So program graph induces state graph
Conversion program graph associated state graph called unfolding program graph
The program graph sequence command
If variable exist state consists program counter keep track program execution next command applied
In case executing command program counter position state command executed
Executing command move program counter next command
Since program counter whole state follows executing command changed state
So command corresponds transition two state
Now consider full case variable exist affected program command executed
Then different program counter location program counter change variable might also change value due command executed
Consequently even revisit program command
loop imply program state
In previous case program would state whole state program counter program counter point position next command suffices specify state
However state includes variable change value program location different variable value meaning different state program state space
The term unfolding originates multiplication location producing state graph program graph
A representative example loop incrementing counter overflow becomes
Although loop executes increment command iteratively program graph executes cycle state space cycle line
This result state program location cycling combined counter value strictly increasing overflow different state visited sequence overflow
After overflow counter becomes initial state revisited state space closing cycle state space assuming counter initialized
The figure attempt show reversal role aligning arc state diagram processing stage flowchart
You compare flowchart assembly line manufacturing flowchart describes progression task beginning end transforming source code input object code output compiler
A state machine generally notion progression
The door state machine shown top article example advanced stage closed state compared opened state simply reacts differently event
A state state machine efficient way specifying particular behavior rather stage processing
An interesting extension allow arc flow number state number state
This make sense system allowed multiple state implies individual state describes condition partial aspect overall global state
The resulting formalism known
Another extension allows integration flowchart within Harel statecharts
This extension support development software event driven workflow driven

A state diagram diagram used computer science describe behavior system considering possible state object event occurs
This behavior represented analyzed series event occur one possible state
Each diagram represents object track various state object throughout system
There exist different type state diagram different semantics slightly different
State diagram graphically represent finite state machine
They used understand object behavior throughout whole system
The element constitute state diagram rounded box representing state arrow showing transition next state
The activity section depicts activity object performs state
Every state diagram start initial state state object created
Right initial state object change state next state determined condition based activity
In case state diagram represent super state condition created many transition lead particular state
The super state depicts state inside diagram transition redundant state making diagram complex
A transition state diagram progression one state another triggered event internal external entity modeled
An action operation invoked entity modeled

In program described designed remember preceding event user interaction remembered information called system
The set state system occupy known
In state space often system internal behaviour interaction environment consists separately occurring individual action event accepting input producing output may may cause system change state
Examples system circuit component
The output digital circuit computer program time completely determined current input state
circuit divided two type whose output dependent present input signal whose output function current input past history input
In sequential logic information past input stored electronic memory element
The stored content memory element given point time collectively referred circuit contains information past circuit access
Since two possible state finite number memory element digital circuit certain finite number possible state
If number binary memory element circuit maximum number state circuit
Similarly computer program store data represent storage location computer
The content memory location given point program execution called program
way designing describes computation term program state statement change program state
In language program describes desired result specify change state directly
A specialized definition state used computer program operate sequentially stream data program
Serial program operate incoming data character packet sequentially one time
In program information previous data character packet received stored variable used affect processing current character packet
This called data carried previous processing cycle called state
In others program information previous data stream start fresh data input called
The output sequential circuit computer program time completely determined current input current state
Since memory element two possible state total number different state circuit assume finite fixed number memory element
If binary memory element digital circuit distinct state
The concept state formalized abstract mathematical called used design sequential digital circuit computer program
An example everyday device state
To change channel TV user usually press channel channel button remote control sends coded message set
In order calculate new channel user desire digital tuner television must stored number
It add one subtracts one number get number new channel adjusts TV receive channel
This new number stored
Similarly television also store number control level produced speaker
Pressing volume volume button increment decrement number setting new level volume
Both number part TV state
They stored preserve information TV turned turned TV return previous station volume level
As another example state content memory element
When computer laptop go save energy shutting processor state processor stored computer restored computer come hibernation processor take operation left
Following state distinguished

State transition diagram used right beginning modeling
The basic idea define machine number state hence term finite state machine
The machine receives event outside world event cause machine transition one state another
For example take look figure
Here machine bottle bottling plant
It begin empty state
In state receive squirt event
If squirt event cause bottle become full transition full state otherwise stay empty state indicated transition back state
When full state cap event cause transition sealed state
The diagram indicates full bottle receive squirt event empty bottle receive cap event
Thus get good sense event occur effect object
State transition diagram around long object modeling
They give explicit even formal definition behavior
A big disadvantage mean define possible state system
Whilst right small system soon break larger system exponential growth number state
This state explosion problem lead state transition diagram becoming far complex much practical use
To combat state explosion problem method define separate diagram class
This pretty much eliminates explosion problem since class simple enough comprehensible state transition diagram
It however raise problem difficult visualize behavior whole system number diagram individual class lead people interaction activity modeling
The popular variety diagram object method Harel Statechart Figure
This introduced Rumbaugh taken Booch adopted UML
It one powerful flexible form state transition diagram
A particularly valuable feature approach ability generalize state allows factor common transition thus I show break event applies full empty state creating
It also flexible approach handling processing
Processes instantaneous
interrupted bound transition entry exit state called action
Processes long interrupted bound state called activity
Transitions also condition attached mean transition occurs condition true
There also capability concurrent state diagram allowing object one diagram describe behavior
Not method use Harel Statecharts
One notable dissenter use simpler Moore model state diagram
This form allows process occur state hence extra state Figure superstates
This good example question expressiveness technique
The Harel Statechart clearly expressive technique since expressive learn using
In addition difficult implement
take view since state diagram get complex drawn single object extra expressiveness worthwhile
State model ideal describing behavior single object
They also formal tool built execute
Their biggest limitation good describing behavior involved several object case use activity diagram
People often find drawing state diagram several object natural way describing process
In case try either drawing single state diagram process using
This defines basic behavior need refactor split across number object
UML us Harel statecharts also become popular style state diagram object method
For initial tutorial I would suggest either Booch Rumbaugh
For treatment take look Cook Daniels give lot good detail formalism integration design contract discussion use state diagram subclassing

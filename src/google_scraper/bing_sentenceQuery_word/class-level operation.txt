In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Well general question
And anyone want make implementation specific I prefer Unix related stuff
But first need know following problem generality I read single process multiple thread
Multiple thread process share thing among
I want know share
Considering process comprised address space stack heap global variable code data OS resource among shared thread
I following guessing I read thread share global variable
Also programming Java C I made thread share class level variable
So I believing thread share global variable though sure whether concept high level programming language translates low operating system level fact
Since global variable stored heap heap shared among thread
Since thread execution must stack might program counter content say function call return happen
So thread process share stack
Now I unsure sharing following thing Not sure exactly count address space
But I guess address space generally used context process thread
And since thread process reside address space parent process said thread share address space
But maintain different stack inside address space
I guess implementation specific
For example parent process selective give handle file thread
Or I mistaking OS resource mean something file
Threads different code sharing code always case
Unsure consider data
But sure global variable shared among thread
And sure local variable similarly shared
Overall I considerably confused due vague term done Operating Systems book specific detail provided online
So I trying find answer satisfy
In general register including program counter stack pointer stack
Everything else shared thread sharing process
In particular generally considered consist set thread sharing address space heap static data code segment file descriptor
An simply mapping logical address specific piece physical memory
So say thread process share address space mean accessing variable global scope thread see variable
Similarly thread may running different point code particular time permitted call global function correspond function every thread process
Most modern operating system added notion variable global scope shared
The usual example use variable
That single variable global scope modern operating system thread given local copy error library call one thread wo impact behavior thread
There additional process state shared thread process thing like process id signal handling file lock
For complete list process state shared thread need look documentation specific threading implementation
For example
That depends
If consider thread defined POSIX offered Unix system Windows familiar later ask specifically give answer essentially WanderingLogic answer explains
Linux idea thread using system call
It offer rather control parent child share
It go far essentially wrapper around internal calling specific flag create thread share next nothing parent
Look manual page detail available

Yes Linux offer POSIX style thread much besides
Threads come two perspective operating system programming language
In case variation attribute thread
A minimal definition thread stuff happens sequence one thing another
In typical machine execution model thread set register program counter
If machine set specific register stack pointer one copy per thread
From operating system perspective minimum operating system need support thread provide way switch
This happen either automatically thread make explicit request cooperative multitasking case thread sometimes called
There also hybrid model preemption cooperative yield
preemption thread different group task explicit yield thread
Switching thread involves minimum saving register value old thread restoring register value new thread
In multitasking operating system provides treat term synonym OS context task resource particular address space also open file privilege etc
Isolation provided operating system entity process
Each task normally least one thread task execute code much use
The operating system may may support multiple thread task example original Unix
A task still run multiple thread arranging switch require special privilege
This called especially Unix context
Nowadays Unix system provide kernel thread particular way multiple thread process running different processor
Most operating system resource apart computation time attached task thread
Some operating system example Linux explicitly delimit stack case thread OSes kernel know anything stack part heap far concerned
The kernel also typically manages kernel context thread data structure containing information thread currently let kernel handle multiple thread blocked system call time
As far operating system concerned thread task run code different position code different program counter value
It may may happen certain part code program always executed specific thread usually common code
utility function called thread
All thread see data otherwise considered different task data accessed particular thread usually solely purview programming language operating system
In programming language storage shared thread program
This model concurrent programming popular also programmer need careful data accessed multiple thread occur
Note even local variable shared thread usually mean variable whose name valid one execution function another thread obtain pointer variable access
There also programming language thread storage communication happens sending message communication channel
This model concurrent programming
main programming language focus message passing execution environment lightweight handling thread encourages program written many thread contrast programming language creating thread relatively expensive operation runtime environment ca support large number thread time
Erlang sequential subset part language happens within thread particular data manipulation mostly purely functional thus thread send message another thread containing data neither thread need worry data modified thread using
Some language blend two model offering storage without type system distinguish storage location global one
storage usually convenience feature allows variable name designate different storage location different thread
Some difficult may interest understand thread By posting answer agree

A OOP associated
An object mostly made data behavior form interface object present outside world
Data represented object behavior method
For example object would method state whether opened closed would property
In method defined object instance given class
One important capability method provides method overriding
The name used multiple different kind class
This allows sending object invoke behavior delegate implementation behavior receiving object
A method Java programming set behavior class object
For example object send message another object appropriate formula invoked whether receiving object etc
Methods also provide interface class use access modify data object
This known encapsulation
Encapsulation overriding two primary distinguishing feature method procedure call
overloading two significant way method differs conventional procedure function call
Overriding refers subclass redefining implementation method superclass
For example may method defined shape class
The various subclass etc
would define appropriate formula calculate area
The idea look object black box change internals object made minimal impact object use
This known encapsulation meant make code easier maintain
Method overloading hand refers differentiating code used handle message based parameter method
If one view receiving object first parameter method overriding special case overloading selection based first argument
The following simple example illustrates difference Accessor method used read data value object
Mutator method used modify data object
Manager method used initialize destroy object class
constructor destructors
These method provide facilitates
For example class provides accessor method retrieve current rather directly accessing balance data field later code implement complex mechanism balance retrieval fetch without dependent code needing changed
The concept encapsulation modularity unique programming
Indeed many way approach simply logical extension previous paradigm
A method called beginning object lifetime create initialize object process called
Initialization may include acquisition resource
Constructors may parameter usually return value language
See following example Java A method called automatically end object lifetime process called
Destruction language allow destructor method argument return value
Destruction implemented perform cleanup chore task object destruction
In language destructors known
They similar purpose function destructors difference language utilize language manual memory management sequence called different
An one
It often used specify subclass must provide implementation method
Abstract method used specify computer language
The following code show abstract class need extended The following subclass extends main class Class method method called rather instance
They typically used part object
class defined instance class object created
allow class created deleted
In sense provide functionality constructor destructors described
But language allows developer dynamically alter object model run time create new class redefine class hierarchy modify property etc
Special method language may support none special method defined
A language compiler may automatically generate default special method programmer may allowed optionally define special method
Most special method directly called rather compiler generates code call appropriate time
Static method meant relevant instance class rather specific instance
They similar static variable sense
An example would static method sum value variable every instance class
For example class might static method compute average price product
In Java commonly used static method This static method owning object run instance
It receives information argument
A static method invoked even instance class exist yet
Static method called static resolved compile time based class called dynamically case instance method resolved polymorphically based runtime type object
operator define action performed compiler class object assigned class object type
Operator method define operation performed symbol associated method parameter
Example Some procedural language extended capability leverage large skill set legacy code language still provide benefit development
Perhaps example extension programming language
Due design requirement add paradigm existing procedural language message passing unique capability terminology
For example method known
also concept member function allow
mean class achieve polymorphic behavior

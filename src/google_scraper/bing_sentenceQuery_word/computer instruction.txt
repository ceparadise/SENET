Wisconsin defines Computer Science academic discipline encompasses study computer algorithmic process including principle hardware software design application network impact society
This working definition Computer Science draw upon five core concept Visit information Computer Science Requirements The Wisconsin academic standard Computer Science developed statewide writing committee submitted extensive review public State Superintendent Review Council
State Superintendent Tony Evers adopted standard June
The Wisconsin vision CS standard shaped Wisconsin practitioner expert business community informed work national level state
This vision CS standard CSTA CS Standards intended As standard Wisconsin Standards Computer Science may taught integrated variety class experience
Each district school program area determine mean student meet standard
Through collaboration multiple stakeholder foundational standard set stage successful contemporary CS course program throughout Wisconsin system

Their life swirl technology nation high school student spend little time studying computer science basis
Few taught write line code take class delve working Internet explain create app
In world went digital long ago computer science staple education school even offer course subject including high school Virginia Fairfax County six Maryland Montgomery County
It shocking little said Rebecca Dovi taught computer science year Virginia school advocate course statewide
Even school offer class said relatively
You might one person teaching school Though computer science lead technology job boost skill variety field many student get little exposure subject class
Across Washington region school system fewer one high school student took computer science academic year according district data
But slowly might starting change
Spurred part national initiative local district urging student take computer science course trying address glaring gender racial disparity
By next school year school leader expect computer science course Montgomery high school enrollment course Virginia Loudoun County school offering class District
And Charles County student committed bring learning every grade starting fall partnership nonprofit work increase access computer science school
We really believe skill get coding help whatever career choose said Charles County Superintendent Kimberly Hill pointed learning requires logic habit mind broader us
Computer science math whizz budding techie said
Typically male
Typically white male Hill said adding begs question Where girl
Where African American Hispanic kid Under county new plan said thinking You learn code like learn read learn Among reason many school computer science It priority core subject computer science teacher hard find drawn tech job
While increasing number state allow course count math science credit usually requirement sometimes viewed student boring intimidating
Many parent mistake computer see school seeming ease teenager manage device sign computer science understanding
These skill fundamental algebra said Marie desJardins computer science professor University Maryland Baltimore County leading project train computer science teacher Maryland District period
During next decade percent new job science technology engineering math field computing professional desJardins said
There field right computer science contribute support said Chris Stephenson executive director Computer Science Teachers Association
Still said kid chance get introduced content high school kid least likely opportunity Hoping reach student especially girl minority Montgomery school leader also signed
Ten county high school slated offer course go beyond programming learning topic Internet interaction
As school system nation stuck box computer science teach kid something learn maybe later said Pat Yongpradit former Montgomery teacher director education
brought widespread attention learning gap first video early last year went viral December campaign drew million people worldwide
The organization partnered increasing number school system nationally month providing professional development teacher new curricular material
In Rockville David Silversmith needed convincing
One recent morning Thomas Wootton High School senior puzzling line code game Connect Four
Silversmith plan become computer scientist decided class important
I think whatever profession nowadays Maryland teen said definitely In public school new course offered school year six high school another four high school get computer science class fall
The kid like class showing engaged said Anthony Priest school program manager
The District made computer science requirement
There smaller effort expand computer science
In Fairfax County teacher Dan Tra jazzed programming course lot app development worked hard market got student take class Falls Church High School year
More percent student female
Falls Church Robotics Club Girls Technology Club
More student entered late March winning honor
In school thirst Tra said
Computer science course poorly tracked nationally often misunderstood expert say
Many people confuse course using computer software true computer science creating computer
The reliable figure computer science reach high school come Advanced Placement AP exam
In Fairfax County nearly high school student student took recent AP exam computer science
In Montgomery high school student took recent AP exam
There little combined public school system District Prince George County Maryland Alexandria Arlington Loudoun Prince William county Virginia
Barbara Ericson senior research scientist Georgia Tech study AP computer science result said Maryland Virginia District made computer science participation per caput
Nationally student took exam
Still Ericson said remains course More student took popular AP calculus exam last year nearly took biology exam
In girl accounted percent computer science Hispanic student percent black student percent
Locally sign problem new interest

Williams High School Alexandria example lost computer science teacher unable find another certified seven student course take online official said
In Loudoun enrollment rise brought professional classroom
All Loudoun high school offer computer science AP computer science
Dan Kasun Microsoft executive involved program said collaboration inspires teacher turn get student excited
About student expected take class next year Loudoun year
People realizing skill set going lead job Kasun said

All computer software built set instruction
Instructions encoded binary
The cycle sequence step CPU follows process instruction
Software program set instruction
For execute instruction one must first translated simple code activate part CPU
The CPU performs basic function A piece software game combine function perform complex task
The carry calculation make decision data sent processor
The CU also called controller control data moving processor control timing operation instruction sent processor
The CU directs system carry program instruction
It fetching decoding managing instruction
also called internal memory immediate access memory store
A register small amount fast temporary memory within processor ALU CU store change value needed execute instruction
Different processor different set register
One important register

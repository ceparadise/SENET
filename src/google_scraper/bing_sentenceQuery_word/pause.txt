In serf element two principal operation The order element come stack give rise alternative name
Additionally operation may give access top without modifying stack
The name stack type structure come analogy set physical item stacked top make easy take item top stack getting item deeper stack may require taking multiple item first
Considered abstractly sequential collection push pop operation occur one end structure referred stack
This make possible implement stack pointer top element
A stack may implemented bounded capacity
If stack full contain enough space accept entity pushed stack considered state
The pop operation remove item top stack
Stacks entered computer science literature used term bury unbury mean calling returning subroutine
Subroutines already implemented proposed idea filed patent March Bauer received invention stack principle
The concept developed independently Australian first half
Stacks often described analogy stack plate cafeteria
Clean plate placed top stack pushing already
When plate removed stack one pop become new top
In many implementation stack operation push pop
An example top stack observes element without removing stack
Since done pop push data essential
An underflow condition occur stack top operation stack empty pop
Also implementation often function return whether stack empty
A stack easily implemented either
What identifies data structure stack either case implementation interface user allowed pop push item onto array linked list helper operation
The following demonstrate implementation using
An array used implement bounded stack follows
The first element usually bottom resulting first element pushed onto stack last element popped
The program must keep track size length stack using variable record number item pushed far therefore pointing place array next element inserted assuming index convention
Thus stack effectively implemented structure The operation add element increment index checking overflow Similarly decrement index checking underflow return item previously top one Using possible implement stack grow shrink much needed
The size stack simply size dynamic array efficient implementation stack since adding item removing item end dynamic array requires amortized O time
Another option implementing stack use
A stack pointer head list perhaps counter keep track size list Pushing popping item happens head list overflow possible implementation unless memory exhausted Some language make stack operation push pop available standard type
Some language notably family including designed around stack directly visible manipulated programmer
The following example manipulating stack Lisp interpreter prompt line starting interpreter response expression Several container type operation LIFO semantics additionally template class adapts existing container provide restricted operation
PHP class
Java library contains class specialization
Following example program language using class
A common use stack architecture level mean allocating accessing memory
A typical stack area computer memory fixed origin variable size
Initially size stack zero
A usually form hardware register point recently referenced location stack stack size zero stack pointer point origin stack
The two operation applicable stack There many variation basic principle stack operation
Every stack fixed location memory begin
As data item added stack stack pointer displaced indicate current extent stack expands away origin
Stack pointer may point origin stack limited range address either origin depending direction stack grows however stack pointer cross origin stack
In word origin stack address stack grows downwards towards address stack pointer must never incremented beyond etc
If pop operation stack cause stack pointer move past origin stack occurs
If push operation cause stack pointer increment decrement beyond maximum extent stack occurs
Some environment rely heavily stack may provide additional operation example Stacks often visualized growing bottom like stack
They may also visualized growing left right topmost becomes rightmost even growing top bottom
The important feature bottom stack fixed position
The illustration section example growth visualization top stack bottom since stack top item pushed popped
A move first element third position second first third second
Here two equivalent visualization process A stack usually represented computer block memory cell bottom fixed location stack pointer holding address current top cell stack
The top bottom terminology used irrespective whether stack actually grows towards lower memory address towards higher memory address
Pushing item stack adjusts stack pointer size item either decrementing incrementing depending direction stack grows memory pointing next cell copy new top item stack area
Depending exact implementation end push operation stack pointer may point next unused location stack may point topmost item stack
If stack point current topmost item stack pointer updated new item pushed onto stack point next available location stack updated new item pushed onto stack
Popping stack simply inverse pushing
The topmost item stack removed stack pointer updated opposite order used push operation
Many design including dedicated register use stack pointer dedicated call return push pop instruction implicitly update dedicated register thus increasing density
Some CISC processor like also typically stack pointer well
In contrast CPU design dedicated stack instruction therefore register may used stack pointer needed
The architecture example set register organised stack direct access individual register relative current top also possible
As machine general implicit argument allows small footprint good usage also prevents type optimization possible processor permitting two three operand
A stack structure also make implementation somewhat complex implement although still feasible exemplified modern implementation
example architecture using within another strategy avoid use slow main memory function argument return value
There also number small microprocessor implement stack directly hardware stack directly accessible
Examples line
Many microprocessor used implement programming language level
Stacks also used basis number mainframe mini computer
Such machine called famous
Calculators employing use stack structure hold value
Expressions represented prefix postfix infix notation conversion one form another may accomplished using stack
Many compiler use stack parsing syntax expression program block etc
translating low level code
Most programming language allowing parsed stack based machine
Another important application stack
Consider simple example finding correct path maze
There series point starting point destination
We start one point
To reach final destination several path
Suppose choose random path
After following certain path realise path chosen wrong
So need find way return beginning path
This done use stack
With help stack remember point reached
This done pushing point stack
In case end wrong path pop last point stack thus return last point continue quest find right path
This called backtracking
The prototypical example backtracking algorithm find vertex graph reached specified starting vertex
Other application backtracking involve searching space represent potential solution optimization problem
technique performing backtracking search without exhaustively searching potential solution space
A number meaning define basic operation adding two number printing character taking argument stack placing return value back stack
For example return stack operand stack also graphic state stack dictionary stack
Many also including
Almost way receive parameter return special stack hold information calling nesting order switch context called function restore caller function calling finish
The function follow runtime protocol caller callee save argument return value stack
Stacks important way supporting nested function call
This type stack used implicitly compiler support CALL RETURN statement equivalent manipulated directly programmer
Some programming language use stack store data local procedure
Space local data item allocated stack procedure entered deallocated procedure exit
The typically implemented way
Using stack data procedure call important security implication see programmer must aware order avoid introducing serious security bug program
Several use stack separate usual function call stack programming language principle organize information
These include Some computing environment use stack way may make vulnerable security breach attack
Programmers working environment must take special care avoid pitfall implementation
For example programming language use common stack store data local called procedure linking information allows procedure return caller
This mean program move data stack contains critical return address procedure call
If data moved wrong location stack oversized data item moved stack location large enough contain return information procedure call may corrupted causing program fail
Malicious party may attempt attack take advantage type implementation providing oversized data input program check length input
Such program may copy data entirety location stack may change return address procedure called
An attacker experiment find specific type data provided program return address current procedure reset point area within stack within data provided attacker turn contains instruction carry unauthorized operation
This type attack variation attack extremely frequent source security breach software mainly popular compiler use shared stack data procedure call verify length data item
Frequently programmer write code verify size data item either oversized undersized data item copied stack security breach may occur

Methods making class session effective Ways encourage student participation class Advantages collaborative learning Examples effective laboratory practice This chapter discus several method teaching science within traditional format lecture discussion session laboratory
How help student learn science better efficiently format
Although universal best way teach experience show general principle apply American Association Advancement Science McDermott et Mazur Teach scientific way thinking
Actively involve student learning
Help student develop conceptual framework well develop problem solving skill
Promote student discussion group activity
Help student experience science varied interesting enjoyable way
Assess student understanding frequent interval throughout learning process
Evidence number discipline suggests oral presentation large group passive student contribute little real learning
In physic standard lecture help student develop conceptual understanding fundamental process electricity mechanic Arons McDermott Shaffer McDermott et
Similarly student grade large general chemistry lecture course correlate lecturing skill experience instructor Birk Foster
Despite limitation traditional lecture many institution forced offer introductory science course
Many professor teach course feel lecturing option dream could accomplish smaller class
However small growing group science faculty member developed way engage student process thinking questioning problem solving despite large class size
Strategies use introductory course biology geology described sidebar
Although many method described sidebar consistent expert know student learn see may welcomed student class
There several way help student make transition passive listener active participant learning Orzechowksi Start slowly student may much experience active learning
Introduce change beginning course rather midway
Avoid giving student impression experimenting
Biochemistry Genetics Molecular Biology Stanford University Professor Sharon Long Enrollment student One important tool I use engage student create opportunity thought active pursuit unknown class session
If I give lecture I provide common always leave blank critical part note
On board transparency I indicate unknown
I pause I talk drawing student attention hole note
If possible I ask suggested answer vote among possibility
By arranging pause lecture give student chance puzzle question preview ability work question independently
And attending class student gain important draw encourage class attendance
In teaching formal genetics I draw genetic cross first general form example Drosophila eye color inheritance test w x w w Then I put lecture completely blank Punnett square show structure provide answer
The student encounter unknown I address content line box question
Everybody consult neighbor second row anybody tell two blank top
What would genotype phenotype bottom right box
Physical Geology Arizona State University Professor Ramon Arrowsmith Enrollment student I show example geology experience occasionally include funny slide video audio clip lighten thing
I use multimedia presentation system composed vertical camera illuminated table I write place rock example book anything else I want student see
The video signal projected screen classroom
This form presentation worked well definitely improved student access material making thing visible
Along presentation system I use laser disc containing movie photograph textbook publisher
I easily switch multimedia laser disc output thus weave visual example lecture
Occasionally I show student computer file video VHS player
The student react well multimedia approach involve student I short exercise group talk
For I walk side auditorium designate even odd row
Then I say even people turn around face odd people exercise together
This generates group people
They put name onto single sheet turn
Then student work together question minute
I walk around room answering question
When time TA stand overhead projector I walk crowd I lapel mike hear collecting answer question
Then talk solution
Usually time run student turn paper
Of course get credit participation provides motivation I sure student understand concept better presented lecture
This process engages student
Of course grows student move assigned topic conversation come back fairly quickly
It bit unnerving potential loss control class student seem either like indifferent certainly quite passive lectured
Do give lecture completely
Anticipate student anxiety prepared provide support encouragement adapt expectation
Discuss approach colleague especially teaching course curriculum
When lecturing chosen necessary teaching method one way keep student engaged pause periodically ass student understanding initiate short student discussion see sidebar
Calling individual student answer question offer comment also hold student attention however student prefer feedback method anonymity
If opportunity discus question small group group offer answer remove one student spotlight
Another option student write answer index card pas card end row student seated select one answer present without disclosing whose
The literature teaching learning contains example technique maintain student attention lecture setting Eble Davis Lowman McKeachie Avoid direct repetition material textbook remains useful alternative resource
Use paradox puzzle apparent contradiction engage student
Make connection current event everyday phenomenon
Begin class something familiar important student
End class summarizing main point made
Adopt reasonable adjustable pace balance content coverage student understanding
Consider using slide video film computer simulation enhance presentation remember Students take note darkened room
The text need large enough read back room
Students need time summarize observation draw note conclusion
Pay attention delivery Maintain eye contact student part room
Step behind lecture bench feasible
Move around much distracting
Talk student blackboard
If using board avoid blocking AV projector screen
Shift mood intensity
Vary presentation technique
At beginning course discus student several strategy effectively engaging learning class
Some may listen others take note still others may try transcribe word
Some student may want tape class session
If want encourage particular form student participation make clear expectation reason student learning benefit
Whether lecture discussion section laboratory individual encounter questioning important part guiding student learning
When student ask question often seeking shortcut learning process getting right answer authority figure
However process arriving answer assessing validity answer usually important particularly student apply process next question
Both process obscured teacher simply give requested answer
Often Socratic student question another perhaps leading student often frustrating offer possible answer supporting reason assessment
In fact posing question effective teaching technique
Here tip effective use question Wait long enough indicate expect student think answering
Some student know silent professor give answer Rowe
Solicit answer volunteer selected student
Determine student confidence level listen answer
Solicit alternative answer elaboration provide material comparison contrast assessment
Solicit additional response student leading question observation
Direct ensuing discussion comparison evaluation extension offered answer rather simple validation refutation right wrong answer
Pose second question continue exploration
Biochemistry Genetics Molecular Biology Stanford University Professor Sharon Long Enrollment student Even demonstration work large class us everyday object student recognize especially something student find use
My favorite example use telephone cord demonstrate supercoiling DNA
The phone cord intrinsic helicity DNA though usually phone cord left handed whereas DNA often discussed right handed B form
Who experience coiled headset cord telephone show supercoils twist around
This present student chance play home convince direction handedness supercoils depends direction original helix whether cord underwound overwound headset replaced constraining end
Students learn important principle understanding nucleic acid handy practical tip let predict easiest way get kink phone cord
They get chance test understanding making prediction one hope active scientific learning
A professor question build confidence rather induce fear
One technique encourage student propose several different answer question
The student encouraged step outside answer begin develop skill necessary ass answer
Some question seek fact simply measure student recall others demand higher reasoning skill elaborating explaining concept comparing contrasting several possibility speculating outcome speculating cause effect
The type question asked response given student initial answer crucial type reasoning process student encouraged use
Several aspect question formulate reasoning knowledge tested encouraged deal dialogue testing
Chapters contain information question part assessment testing grading
Demonstrations effective illustrating concept class result passive learning without careful attention engaging student
They provoke student think especially helpful demonstration surprise challenge assumption illustrates otherwise abstract concept mechanism
Demonstrations use everyday object especially effective require little preparation part faculty see sidebar
Students interest peaked asked make prediction vote probable outcome
There numerous resource available help faculty design conduct demonstration
Many science education periodical contain one demonstration issue
The Demonstrations column Favorite Demonstration column two many example
The American Chemical Society University Wisconsin Press published excellent book chemical demonstration Shakhashiri Summerlin Ealy Summerlin et
Similar volume physic demonstration published American Association Physics Teachers Freier Anderson Berry
You consider number issue planning demonstration What concept want demonstration illustrate
Which many demonstration selected topic generate greatest enhancement student learning
Where class would effective
What prior knowledge reviewed demonstration
What design would effective given material hand target audience
Which step demonstration procedure carried ahead time
What question appropriate motivate direct student observation thought process demonstration
What question used test stretch student understanding new concept
If classroom lecture hall large consider whether student back able see demonstration
Look videotaping demonstration projecting image larger screen student see
Small group discussion section often used course complement lecture
In course small enrollment substitute lecture lecture discussion format used class period
The main distinction lecture discussion level student participation expected whole continuum exists
Discussions student answer instructor question student address one another instructor mainly guide discussion toward important point
In case discussion session productive student expected prepare advance
Focused discussion effective way many student develop conceptual framework learn problem solving skill try idea student instructor
The give take technical discussion also sharpens critical quantitative thinking skill
Classes student must participate discussion force go beyond merely plugging number formula memorizing term
They must learn explain word thinking
Students motivated prepare class expected participate actively
However discussion le predictable presentation time consuming require skill teacher
To lead effective discussion teacher must good facilitator ensuring key point covered monitoring group dynamic
Guidance needed keep discussion becoming disorganized irrelevant
Some student like may function effectively class much time devoted student discussion
Some may take point view paid hear expert teacher
For student useful review benefit format contrast lecture whose purpose transmit information
Sensitivity personality cultural linguistic gender difference may affect student participation discussion also important especially participation graded
When student spontaneously engage discussion may unprepared may reluctant speak assertive
Some may comfortable making comparison absolute statement others may comfortable narrative description quantitative analysis
You might try various strategy engage student meaningful discussion posing question measure different level understanding knowledge application analysis comprehension see
Probably best overall advice bold flexible willing adjust strategy fit character class
If want experiment using discussion class thing consider Decide goal class discussion
What want student get class session
Concepts
Problem solving skill
skill
The ability make connection discipline technology
Broader perspective
Keep mind goal may change progress material quarter semester
Explain student discussion structured
Will discussion involve whole class student work smaller group
Make clear expect coming class session read chapter think question end chapter seriously try first five problem etc
Let student see take attendance
Students come class may studying
If want student discus question concept small group explain student group form
Do allow student dominate discussion
Some student naturally respond quickly must encouraged let others chance
Be sure student participate acceptable level
In extreme case may speak outside class aggressive excessively reticent student
Look opportunity student bring class illustrating important point day topic
This effective way stimulate discussion
Be willing adjust need student take advantage strength teacher
Watch sign student need le guidance
Are main point coming getting resolved
Do need summarizing moderating
Collaborative learning umbrella term variety educational approach involving joint intellectual effort student student teacher together Goodsell et
Cooperative learning form collaborative learning instructional technique student work group achieve common goal contribute individually accountable way Stover et
The interaction take different form study group discussion group project group class group role leader timekeeper technician spokesperson forth assigned rotated Although cooperative learning used effectively elementary middle high school number year discussed Johnson Johnson Slavin study done demonstrate effectiveness college classroom
Nevertheless growing number practitioner assessing effectiveness Treisman Fullilove Johnson et Smith et Caprio Posner Markstein Cooper Watson Marshall
While many advocate collaborative learning quick point advantage also sensitive perceived problem
Cooper example point coverage lack control class student carry weight group need considered embarking collaborative learning
In addition evaluation group work requires careful consideration see
It hard imagine learning science learning science without laboratory field work
Experimentation underlies scientific knowledge understanding
Laboratories wonderful setting teaching learning science
They provide student opportunity think discus solve real problem
Developing teaching effective laboratory requires much skill creativity hard work proposing executing research project
Despite importance experimentation science introductory lab fail convey excitement discovery majority student
They generally give introductory science lab low mark often describing boring waste time
What wrong
It clear many introductory laboratory program suffering neglect
Typically student work way list instruction trying reproduce expected result wondering get right answer
While approach little science common practice efficient
Laboratories costly time consuming predictable cookbook lab allow department offer lab course large number student
Improving undergraduate laboratory instruction become priority many institution driven part exciting program developed wide range institution
Some lab encourage critical quantitative thinking emphasize demonstration principle development lab technique help student deepen understanding fundamental concept Hake
Where possible lab coincident lecture discussion
Before begin develop laboratory program important think goal
Here number possibility Develop intuition deepen understanding concept
Apply concept learned class new situation
Experience basic phenomenon
Develop critical quantitative thinking
Develop experimental data analysis skill
Learn use scientific apparatus
Learn estimate statistical error recognize systematic error
Develop reporting skill written oral
Practice collaborative problem solving
Exercise curiosity creativity designing procedure test hypothesis
Better appreciate role experimentation science
Test important law rule
Developing effective laboratory requires appropriate space equipment extraordinary effort department creative teacher
Still invested innovative introductory laboratory program report encouraging result better understanding material much positive student attitude toward lab faculty participation lab Wilson
Many science department implemented innovative laboratory program introductory course
We encourage consult organization publication listed Appendices
Education session professional society meeting another opportunity get good idea lab discipline
Some faculty member given lecturing large Animal Behavior Laboratory Princeton University Professor James Gould Enrollment approximately student section A major goal course teach student science collect initial observation formulate testable hypothesis perform test refine overhaul original hypothesis devise new test
Each lab two week long equipment animal available entire time
All material student could plausibly need stored shelf easy immediate access
In first hour discus lab possible hypothesis look material hand
Each group formulates initial plan obtains approval plan conduct experiment
The flexible lab utilize stimulus
In one lab student asked determine feature prey toad responds
Although begin live cricket worm encouraged use computer library virtual cricket toad
Students given instruction making new prey model modifying existing one test toad response different feature
The library includes variation shape motion color size plus variety cricket chirp call
In general student quickly discover virtual cricket work almost well real provide data since toad never fill
A simple statistical program computer help minimize drudgery data analysis enabling student concentrate experimental design result rather tedious computation
A number lab course make use modified stimulus
Labs using strategy deal mate recognition cricket fish competitor recognition fish predator recognition chick fish imprinting duckling color change lizard hemispheric dominance human
Cooperative Learning Laboratory Students two laboratory section chemistry course nonscience major worked group three two experiment acid base buffer
The experiment devised using modified jigsaw technique student group assigned particular part lesson unit responsible helping member group learn material
The week prior laboratory student given list objective preparatory work divided three part
Students decided divide responsibility preparatory laboratory task informed score exam would averaged member group would receive grade
Two control section laboratory conducted traditional manner student working independently
All four group student part lecture class significant difference age gender balance previous number chemistry class
Although control section overall GPA higher cooperative learning section versus student cooperative section higher overall score test
The author conclude use cooperative learning laboratory positive effect student achievement
Smith et class meeting favor supervised collaborative learning laboratory setting
Such workshop method devised teaching physic Laws chemistry Lisensky et mathematics
Although feasible many institution idea developed course translate reasonably well course lab associated course Thornton press
Laboratories enriched computer make data acquisition analysis easier much faster thus allowing student think result improved experiment
Computers also used element experiment simulate response vary stimulus
Computers offer convenience flexibility safety laboratory completely replace student interaction natural world
Laboratory teaching method vary widely certainly substitute instructor circulating among student answering asking question pointing subtle detail possible application generally guiding student learning
Although student work informally pair group many lab faculty formally introduced cooperative learning lab see sidebar
Some instructor rely lab handout give cookbook instruction pose carefully constructed sequence question help student design experiment illustrate important concept Hake
One advantage handout designer closely control student lab Moog Farrell
The challenge design student must think creative
In unstructured lab challenge prevent student getting stranded discouraged
Easy access faculty member teaching assistant essential type lab
Once decided goal laboratory familiar innovative idea field ready ask following question How others operated program
Seek colleague department institution may implemented laboratory program similar one considering learn experience
How much time energy willing invest
Buying new equipment tinkering lab probably improve lab much required implement substantial change
Changing way student learn involves rethinking way lab taught writing new lab handout setting training program teaching assistant perhaps designing new experiment
What support
Solicit interest support departmental colleague teaching assistant
Are departmental institutional administration supportive project willing accept risk
Determine likely provide needed resource
Are prepared go still get mediocre student evaluation
Helping Teaching Assistants Teach Laboratory All teaching assistant perform laboratory exercise student determine operational analytical difficulty test instructional note procedure
Teachers discus usual student question misconception idea directing student learning
Teachers review procedure circulating among student group ensure group get attention
Groups visited early help get started
Each group visited several time least midway lab discus preliminary result interpretation toward end lab review outcome interpretation
Teachers review student notebook report meet discus difficulty misconception
Discussions grading comment might made important procedure influence student performance attitude subsequent exercise
The various method student report lab work different pedagogical objective
The formal written report teach student communicate work journal style student sometimes sacrifice content appearance
Keeping lab notebook graded teach student keep record experiment may develop good writing presentation skill
Oral report motivate student understand work well enough explain others take time give student practice writing
Oral report also motivate student keep good notebook especially consult presentation
In choosing important aspect student lab experience consider student might report work future
Many benefit carefully planned laboratory exercise realized instructional staff well prepared teach
Often primary lab instruction come graduate undergraduate teaching assistant faculty member involved designing lab
Time must invested training teaching staff focusing first mastery lab experiment method instruction
It fine art guide student without either simply giving answer seeming obstinately obscure
Teaching assistant taught way difficulty adapting innovative laboratory program suggestion help guide transition
A good part success course depends group spirit whole team instructor teaching assistant
Many group meet weekly perhaps informal structured way teaching assistant provide feedback instructor well learn effective way teach next laboratory experiment see sidebar
The responsibility preparing teaching assistant largely dependent setting
While many faculty member institution responsible preparing teaching assistant task handled basis program large number graduate student
Many professional society publication topic see
The American Association Higher Education another excellent source information
Their publication Lambert Tice provides numerous example teaching assistant training program wide array discipline
Effective science teaching requires creativity imagination innovation
In light concern American science literacy scientist educator struggled teach discipline effectively
provides undergraduate science educator path understanding student accommodating individual difference helping grasp method wonder science
What impact teaching style
How I plan course curriculum
How I make lecture class laboratory effective
How I tell student thinking

In also called within
In case regular field also called instance object example class field one distinct name per employee
A static field also called one variable shared instance
Fields abstracted allow read written field translated getter setter method call
Fields contain fixed number bit known fixed length field
A four byte field example may contain bit binary integer plus sign bit bit
A byte name field may contain person name typically padded blank end
The disadvantage using fixed length field part field may wasted space still required maximum length case
Also field omitted padding missing field still required maintain fixed start position within record instance
A variable length field always physical size
Such field nearly always used text field large field vary greatly length

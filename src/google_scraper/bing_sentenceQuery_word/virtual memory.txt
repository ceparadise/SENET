The operating system manages assignment real memory virtual memory
Address translation hardware CPU often referred automatically translates virtual address physical address
Software within operating system may extend capability provide virtual address space exceed capacity real memory thus reference memory physically present computer
The primary benefit virtual memory include freeing application manage shared memory space increased security due memory isolation able conceptually use memory might physically available using technique
Virtual memory make application programming easier hiding physical memory delegating kernel burden managing eliminating need program handle explicitly process run dedicated address space obviating need program code access memory
considered generalization concept virtual memory
Virtual memory integral part modern implementation usually require hardware support typically form built
While necessary employ hardware support increase performance virtual memory implementation
Consequently older operating system personal computer early generally virtual memory functionality though notable exception mainframe include operating system example personal computer operating system feature virtual memory
During early computer memory expensive
The introduction virtual memory provided ability software system large memory demand run computer le real memory
The saving provided strong incentive switch virtual memory system
The additional capability providing virtual address space added another level security reliability thus making virtual memory even attractive market place
Most modern operating system support virtual memory also run dedicated
Each program thus appears sole access virtual memory
However older operating system even modern one run process single address space composed virtualized memory
computer system require fast consistent response time may opt use virtual memory due decreased virtual memory system trigger unpredictable may produce unwanted
This embedded hardware cost often kept low implementing operation software technique called rather dedicated hardware
In larger program contain logic managing primary secondary storage
Virtual memory therefore introduced extend primary memory make extension easy possible programmer use
To allow many early system divided memory multiple program without virtual memory early model via
The concept virtual memory first developed German doctoral thesis described machine block primary core memory address space block hardware automatically moving block primary memory secondary drum memory
first implemented way extend working memory combining word primary additional word secondary
The first Atlas commissioned working prototype paging developed
In independently released first commercial computer virtual memory rather paging
Before virtual memory could implemented mainstream operating system many problem addressed
Dynamic address translation required expensive specialized hardware initial implementation slowed access memory slightly
There worry new algorithm utilizing secondary storage would le effective previously used algorithm
By debate virtual memory commercial computer research team led showed virtual memory overlay system consistently worked better best manually controlled system
Throughout IBM series running based operating system provided mean business user migrate multiple older system fewer powerful mainframe improved
The first introduce virtual memory Norwegian minicomputer implemented virtual memory notably model running
Virtual memory introduced architecture processor segment swapping technique scaled poorly larger segment size
The introduced paging support underneath existing layer enabling page fault exception chain exception without
However loading segment descriptor expensive operation causing operating system designer rely strictly paging rather combination paging segmentation
Nearly current implementation virtual memory divide block contiguous virtual memory address
Pages contemporary system usually least size system large virtual address range amount real memory generally use larger page size
used translate virtual address seen application used hardware process instruction hardware handle specific translation often known
Each entry page table hold flag indicating whether corresponding page real memory
If real memory page table entry contain real memory address page stored
When reference made page hardware page table entry page indicates currently real memory hardware raise invoking paging supervisor component
Systems one page table whole system separate page table application segment tree page table large segment combination
If one page table different application use different part single range virtual address
If multiple page segment table multiple virtual address space concurrent application separate page table redirect different real address
Some earlier system smaller real memory size used instead page table memory address translation
This part operating system creates manages page table
If hardware raise page fault exception paging supervisor access secondary storage return page virtual address resulted page fault update page table reflect physical location virtual address tell translation mechanism restart request
When physical memory already use paging supervisor must free page primary storage hold page
The supervisor us one variety determine page free
Operating system memory area never swapped secondary storage
Other term used page
For example mechanism rely array pointer handler completion
If page containing pointer code invoke pageable would become far complex particularly case page fault interruption
Hence part page table structure pageable
Some page may pinned short period time others may pinned long period time still others may need permanently pinned
For example In IBM operating system successor system term fixed page may fixed may fixed may unfixed pageable
System control structure often fixed measured time time measured second rather time measured fraction one second whereas buffer usually fixed usually measured significantly le time possibly ten millisecond
Indeed OS special facility fast fixing fixed data buffer fixing performed without resorting
used term wired
refer page temporarily made nonpageable buffer locked simply nonpageable never pageable
In similar OSes part system memory managed mode called
In mode every virtual address corresponds real address
This mode used mechanism paging supervisor page table older system application program using management
For example IBM mode
When used problem called occur computer spends unsuitably large amount time transferring page backing store hence slowing useful work
A task minimum set page memory order make useful progress
Thrashing occurs insufficient memory available store working set active program
Adding real memory simplest response improving application design scheduling memory usage help
Another solution reduce number active task system
This reduces demand real memory swapping entire working set one process
Some system use instead paging dividing virtual address space segment
A virtual address consists segment number offset within segment
The support similar segmentation scheme option rarely used
Segmentation paging used together dividing segment page system memory structure usually segmentation providing memory protection
In later processor segment reside linear paged address space
Segments moved space page page main memory providing two level virtual memory operating system instead using paging
Early solution combined paging segmentation paging offer two protection domain whereas VMM guest OS guest application stack need three
The difference paging segmentation system memory division segmentation visible user process part memory model semantics
Hence instead memory look like single large space structured multiple space
This difference important consequence segment page variable length simple way lengthen address space
Segmentation provide memory model differentiation process memory file system consists list segment file mapped process potential address space
This mechanism provided call MapViewOfFile pointer work mapping file place
In Multics file segment file mapped segment address space file always mapped segment boundary
A file linkage section contain pointer attempt load pointer register make indirect reference cause trap
The unresolved pointer contains indication name segment pointer refers offset within segment handler trap map segment address space put segment number pointer change tag field pointer longer cause trap return code trap occurred instruction caused trap
This eliminates need completely work different process map file different place private address space
Some operating system provide swapping entire addition whatever facility paging segmentation
When occurs OS writes page segment currently real memory swap file
In OS read back data swap file automatically read back page paged time swap operation
IBM provides marking address space unswappable pin page address space
This done duration job entering name eligible main program Program Properties Table unswappable flag
In addition privileged code temporarily make address space unswappable With SYSEVENT SVC certain change address space property require OS swap swap back using SYSEVENT TRANSWAP

Memory hardware computer us load operating system run program
It consists one chip several memory module
The amount real memory computer limited amount RAM installed
Common memory size
Because computer finite amount RAM possible run memory many program running one time
This virtual memory come
Virtual memory increase available memory computer enlarging address space place memory data stored
It using hard disk space additional memory allocation
However since hard drive much slower RAM data stored virtual memory must mapped back real memory order used
The process mapping data back forth hard drive RAM take longer accessing directly memory
This mean virtual memory used slow computer
While virtual memory enables computer run program could otherwise best much physical memory possible
This allows computer run program directly RAM avoiding need use virtual memory
Having RAM mean computer work le making faster happier machine

Memory GCSE Computer Science Revision
Everyone benefit good memory
Right
You study math exam remember fact figure ready big day
You remember time
You even remember take pen
You remember fact figure write dazzling paper examiner stunned dazzling math skill give distinction
What kind memory get computer system
How work store data
Firstly let talk volatile memory memory
Volatile memory relies power source store information rather like needing concentrate fact sink
If pay attention class really bad memory fact go one ear remember thing
It volatile memory
As soon switch information lost
memory remains place even power switched
So instance could concentrating class take everything remember
When get home learned class reinforces knowledge stuffed inside head even go sleep switch something else like go dancing play football memory fact still retrieve
The third type memory called virtual memory
A computer system might using set allocation random access memory RAM need run another programme enough RAM
The computer grind halt tell enough space run extra programme would kindly shut one programme want continue
That problem need programme running
So system access extra space another part computer system copy hard drive
What concept transferring space
But give virtual memory run extra programme

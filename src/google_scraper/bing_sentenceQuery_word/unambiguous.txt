In exists one grammar every valid string unique leftmost derivation parse tree
Many language admit ambiguous unambiguous grammar language admit ambiguous grammar
Any language admits ambiguous grammar taking unambiguous grammar introducing duplicate rule synonym language without ambiguous grammar empty language
A language admits ambiguous grammar called inherently ambiguous
always unambiguous important subclass unambiguous grammar unambiguous grammar however
For computer reference grammar often ambiguous due issue problem
If present ambiguity generally resolved adding precedence rule parsing rule overall phrase grammar unambiguous
The simplest example following ambiguous grammar trivial language consists empty string production either empty string
Thus empty string leftmost derivation length indeed length depending many time rule A A used
This language also unambiguous grammar consisting single production rule unique production produce empty string unique string language
In way grammar language made ambiguous adding duplicate
The unary string given character say regular expression unambiguous grammar also ambiguous grammar These correspond producing tree unambiguous grammar allowing association
This elaborated
The ambiguous since two leftmost derivation string As another example grammar ambiguous since two string The language generates however inherently ambiguous following grammar generating language A common example ambiguity computer programming language problem
In many language statement optional result multiple way recognized term grammar
Concretely many language one may write conditionals two valid form form form effect making else clause optional In grammar containing rule ambiguous phrase structure appear
The expression parsed either depending whether associated first second
This resolved various way different language
Sometimes grammar modified unambiguous requiring statement making mandatory
In case grammar left ambiguous ambiguity resolved making overall phrase grammar associating nearest
In latter case grammar unambiguous grammar ambiguous
The simple grammar unambiguous grammar language
While four string one leftmost derivation two different derivation example Only former one leftmost one
The whether arbitrary grammar ambiguous shown equivalent
At least tool implementing detecting ambiguity grammar
The efficiency grammar parsing determined automaton accepts
accepted parsed linear time example
This subset accepted parsed polynomial time example
Unambiguous grammar nondeterministic
For example language alphabet unambiguous grammar S ε
An arbitrary string language parsed without reading letter first mean pushdown automaton try alternative state transition accommodate different possible length string
Nevertheless removing grammar ambiguity may produce deterministic grammar thus allow efficient parsing
Compiler generator include feature resolving kind ambiguity using precedence associativity constraint
The existence inherently ambiguous language proven MIT research report
While language set string generated grammar ambiguous unambiguous grammar exist language unambiguous grammar exist
An example inherently ambiguous language union
This set since union two language always
But give proof way unambiguously parse string common subset

type several interpretation
It thus attribute idea statement whose meaning definitively resolved according rule process finite number step
The part reflects idea two meaning
The concept ambiguity generally contrasted
In ambiguity specific distinct interpretation permitted although may immediately obvious whereas information vague difficult form interpretation desired level specificity
Context may play role resolving ambiguity
For example piece information may ambiguous one context unambiguous another
The word phrase pertains one meaning language word belongs
Meaning refers whatever captured good dictionary
For instance word bank several distinct lexical definition including
Or consider
One could say I bought herb apothecary
This could mean one actually spoke apothecary went apothecary
The context ambiguous word used often make evident meaning intended
If instance someone say I buried bank people would think someone used shovel dig mud
However linguistic context provide sufficient information disambiguate used word
Lexical ambiguity addressed algorithmic method automatically associate appropriate meaning word context task referred
The use word requires author speaker clarify context sometimes elaborate specific intended meaning case le ambiguous term used
The goal clear concise communication receiver misunderstanding meant conveyed
An exception could include politician whose necessary gain support multiple conflicting desire candidate choice
Ambiguity powerful tool
More problematic word whose sens express closely related concept
Good example mean useful functional exemplary pleasing moral versus
I good daughter clear sense intended
The various way apply also create ambiguity unlockable mean capable unlocked impossible lock
arises sentence two different meaning structure syntax
This often due modifying expression prepositional phrase application unclear
He ate cooky couch example could mean ate cooky couch opposed table could mean sitting couch ate cooky
To get need entrance fee voucher driver license
This could mean need EITHER ten dollar OR BOTH voucher license
Or could mean need license AND need EITHER ten dollar OR voucher
Only rewriting sentence placing appropriate punctuation resolve syntactic ambiguity
For notion theoretic result syntactic ambiguity artificial computer see
contain many type ambiguity called phonological ambiguity one way compose set sound word
For example ice cream I scream
Such ambiguity generally resolved according context
A mishearing based incorrectly resolved ambiguity called
happens sentence contains ambiguous word word phrase one meaning
In We saw duck example due Richard Nordquist word duck refer either For example You could new automobile
How test drive
The clause You could present statement wide possible interpretation essentially meaningless
Lexical ambiguity contrasted semantic ambiguity
The former represents choice finite number known meaningful interpretation
The latter represents choice number possible interpretation none may standard meaning
This form ambiguity closely related
Linguistic ambiguity interpretation written document oral agreement often paramount importance
Philosophers user logic spend lot time effort searching removing intentionally adding ambiguity argument lead incorrect conclusion used deliberately conceal bad argument
For example politician might say I oppose tax hinder economic growth example glittering generality
Some think opposes tax general hinder economic growth
Others may think opposes tax belief hinder economic growth
In writing sentence rewritten reduce possible misinterpretation either adding comma tax convey first sense changing convey second sense rewriting way
The devious politician hope constituent interpret statement desirable way think politician support everyone opinion
However opposite also true opponent turn positive statement bad one speaker us ambiguity intentionally
The logical fallacy amphiboly equivocation rely heavily use ambiguous word phrase
In continental philosophy particularly phenomenology existentialism much greater tolerance ambiguity generally seen integral part human condition
Martin Heidegger argued relation subject object ambiguous relation mind body part whole
In Heidegger phenomenology Dasein always meaningful world always underlying background every instance signification
Thus although thing may certain little Dasein sense care existential anxiety face death
In calling work Being Nothingness essay phenomenological ontology Sartre follows Heidegger defining human essence ambiguous relating fundamentally ambiguity
Simone de Beauvoir try base ethic Heidegger Sartre writing The Ethics Ambiguity highlight need grapple ambiguity long philosopher men thought tried mask And ethic proposed disciple always pursued goal
It matter eliminating ambiguity making oneself pure inwardness pure externality escaping sensible world engulfed yielding eternity enclosing oneself pure moment
Ethics based authoritative certainty given mathematics logic prescribed directly empirical finding science
She state Since succeed fleeing let u therefore try look truth face
Let u try assume fundamental ambiguity
It knowledge genuine condition life must draw strength live reason acting
Other continental philosopher suggest concept life nature sex ambiguous
Corey Anton argued certain separate unified something else language asserts divide fact separate
Following Ernest Becker argues desire disambiguate world existence led numerous ideology historical event genocide
On basis argues ethic must focus integrating opposite balancing tension rather seeking priori validation certainty
Like existentialist phenomenologists see ambiguity life basis creativity
In literature rhetoric ambiguity useful tool
Groucho Marx classic joke depends grammatical ambiguity humor example Last night I shot elephant pajama
How got pajama I never know
Songs poetry often rely ambiguous word artistic effect song title Do It Make My Brown Eyes Blue blue refer color sadness
In narrative ambiguity introduced several way motive plot character
Scott Fitzgerald us latter type ambiguity notable effect novel
Christianity Judaism employ concept paradox synonymously
Many Christians Jews endorse Rudolf Otto description sacred tremendum et fascinans mystery fascinates human
dubious discus The orthodox Catholic writer Chesterton regularly employed paradox tease meaning common concept found ambiguous reveal meaning often overlooked forgotten common phrase
The title one famous book Orthodoxy employing paradox
Metonymy involves use name subcomponent part abbreviation jargon name whole object example wheel refer car flower refer beautiful offspring entire plant collection blooming plant
In modern vocabulary critical semiotics metonymy encompasses potentially ambiguous word substitution based contextual contiguity located close together function process object performs sweet ride refer nice car
Metonym miscommunication considered primary mechanism linguistic humour
In piece section confound expectation may interpreted simultaneously different way ambiguous ambiguous ambiguous Stein
The often purposely ambiguous
To quote Theorists apt vex vain effort remove uncertainty high aesthetic value
In visual art certain image visually ambiguous interpreted two way
Perceptions object remain stable time may flip phenomenon called
The opposite ambiguous image
Pictures photograph may also ambiguous semantic level visual image unambiguous meaning narrative may ambiguous certain facial expression one excitement fear instance
Some intention avoiding ambiguity especially
two related language created focusing chiefly syntactic ambiguity well
The language spoken written
These language intended provide greater technical precision big natural language although historically attempt language improvement criticized
Languages composed many diverse source contain much ambiguity inconsistency
The many exception rule difficult learn
In computer science historically used certain context mean either first three power contrary unit unambiguously mean one thousand one million one billion
This usage particularly prevalent electronic memory device
addressed directly binary machine register decimal interpretation make practical sense
Subsequently Ki Mi Gi prefix introduced could written explicitly also rendering k M G text conforming new standard led ambiguity engineering document lacking outward trace binary prefix necessarily indicating new style whether usage k M G remains ambiguous old style new style
Note also M M ambiguously uncertain engineering value defined designate interval storage device began commonly exceed GB capacity ambiguity begin routinely impact second significant digit GB TB almost always mean
widely used avoids many ambiguity compared expression natural language
However various reason several ambiguity remain
The style writing confused defined deterministic unambiguous way
Several still established notation
Usually conversion another notation requires scale argument resulting value sometimes name function used causing confusion
Examples underestablished function Ambiguous expression often appear physical mathematical text
It common practice omit multiplication sign mathematical expression
Also common give name variable function example
Then one see way distinguish whether mean function argument equal
In case use notation reader supposed able perform deduction reveal true meaning
Creators algorithmic language try avoid ambiguity
Many algorithmic language require character symbol multiplication
The used allows user omit multiplication symbol requires square bracket indicate argument function square bracket allowed grouping expression
Fortran addition allow use name identifier different object example function variable particular expression qualified error
The order operation may depend context
In operation division multiplication equal priority executed left right
Until last century many editorial assumed multiplication performed first example interpreted case insertion parenthesis required translating formula algorithmic language
In addition common write argument function without parenthesis also may lead ambiguity
Sometimes one us letter denote elementary function
In style expression mean product variable although slideshow may mean
A comma subscript superscript sometimes omitted also ambiguous notation
If written reader guess context mean object evaluated subscript equal product variable indication trivalent tensor
The writing instead may mean writer either stretched space example reduce publication fee aim increase number publication without considering reader
The may apply use ambiguous notation
Subscripts also used denote argument function
could understood mean either
In addition may mean mean see
convention mean though might thought mean since mean
arguably mean would commonly understood mean
It common define state fixed number photon
Then unwritten rule state coherent Greek character Latin character argument photon state Latin character dominate
The ambiguity becomes even worse used state certain value coordinate mean state certain value momentum may used book
Such ambiguity easily lead confusion especially normalized variable used
Expression may mean state single photon coherent state mean amplitude equal state momentum equal unity
The reader supposed guess context
Some physical quantity yet established notation value sometimes even case depends system notation
Many term ambiguous
Each use ambiguous term preceded definition suitable specific case
Just like state Only context proposition name meaning
A highly confusing term
For example sentence gain system doubled without context mean close nothing
It may mean ratio output voltage electric circuit input voltage doubled
It may mean ratio output power electric optical circuit input power doubled
It may mean gain laser medium doubled example doubling population upper laser level level system assuming negligible absorption
The term ambiguous applied light
The term refer depending background person using term
Also confusion may related use measure concentration imaging system measure size smallest detail still resolved background statistical noise
See also talk
The arises result systematic ambiguity meaning term definable nameable
Terms kind give rise fallacy
Other term type ambiguity satisfiable true false function property class relation cardinal ordinal
In mathematics logic ambiguity considered instance logical concept example leaf open value opposite also called mathematics solution
Logical ambiguity analogous visual ambiguity Necker cube impossible cube many drawing

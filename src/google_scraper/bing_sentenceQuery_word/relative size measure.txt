Karin taught middle high school Health master degree social work
Most u know distance
It total space two thing place usually measured foot yard mile even city block
In geography measured standard unit length referred absolute distance
What relative distance
measure social cultural economic relatedness connectivity two place connected disconnected despite absolute distance
It easy confuse term relative distance relative location actually different concept
Relative location location person place thing relation another
For example could say friend seated second row back movie theater
Or could say location pencil left computer
Many Floridians admit Miami like state compared rest Florida
Almost percent population Miami Hispanic whereas percent population Florida Hispanic
The contrast Florida largest city Jacksonville even stark
Miami largely liberal metropolis politically different conservative Jacksonville percent population Hispanic
So say pretty far relative distance Miami Jacksonville citizen city different culturally ethnically politically

In people started migrating Roseto Valfortore Italy known Roseto Pennsylvania
Most people hard physical laborer poor
They drawn United States promise better life family
A doctor greater area Roseto Pennsylvania stumped citizen lower rate heart disease longer life expectancy despite fact diet consisted pizza cheese pasta
After much research discovered cause lower level stress due feeling connectivity community among resident
The people Roseto ate dinner together went church together
They happier relaxed therefore suffered fewer heart attack
How relate relative distance
You say town Roseto Pennsylvania close relative distance Roseto Valfortore Italy time late despite physical distance
That many resident took cultural religious social value hometown new town
refers connected disconnected two place socially culturally economically despite physical distance
This different distance usually think physical distance separating two location unit measurement called
Relative distance two place highly different culture religion economic goal would far disconnected
If similar term factor relative distance would close connected
The absolute distance two place small relative distance place still vast
Be sure confuse relative distance relative location simply location one place relation another left behind etc

amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

Relative size perceptual clue allows determine close object object known size
Sometimes perception faulty
Humans use relative size judge size moon
This moon seems bigger closer near horizon high sky
We use building tree object known size make judgement size closeness moon
When moon higher sky known object frame reference judge moon closeness thus appears smaller farther away
This called lunar illusion

branch focus classifying according inherent difficulty relating
A computational problem understood task principle amenable solved computer equivalent stating problem may solved mechanical application mathematical step
A problem regarded inherently difficult solution requires significant resource whatever algorithm used
The theory formalizes intuition introducing mathematical study problem quantifying amount resource needed solve time storage
Other measure also used amount communication used number circuit used number processor used
One role computational complexity theory determine practical limit computer
Closely related field theoretical computer science
A key distinction analysis algorithm computational complexity theory former devoted analyzing amount resource needed particular algorithm solve problem whereas latter asks general question possible algorithm could used solve problem
More precisely computational complexity theory try classify problem solved appropriately restricted resource
In turn imposing restriction available resource distinguishes computational complexity computability theory latter theory asks kind problem principle solved algorithmically
A viewed infinite collection together every instance
The input string computational problem referred problem instance confused problem
In computational complexity theory problem refers abstract question solved
In contrast instance problem rather concrete utterance serve input decision problem
For example consider problem
The instance number
solution yes number prime otherwise case
Stated another way particular input problem output corresponding given input
To highlight difference problem instance consider following instance decision version Is route kilometre passing Germany largest city
The quantitative answer particular problem instance little use solving instance problem asking round trip site whose total length km
For reason complexity theory address computational problem particular problem instance
When considering computational problem problem instance
Usually alphabet taken binary alphabet set thus string
As mathematical object bitstrings must suitably encoded
For example represented encoded directly via encoding binary
Even though proof theorem regularly assume concrete choice input encoding one try keep discussion abstract enough independent choice encoding
This achieved ensuring different representation transformed efficiently
one central object study computational complexity theory
A decision problem special type computational problem whose answer either alternately either
A decision problem viewed member language instance whose output yes instance whose output
The objective decide aid whether given input string member formal language consideration
If algorithm deciding problem return answer algorithm said accept input string otherwise said reject input
An example decision problem following
The input arbitrary
The problem consists deciding whether given graph
The formal language associated decision problem set connected course obtain precise definition language one decide graph encoded binary string
A computational problem single output expected every input output complex yes
Notable example include
It tempting think notion function problem much richer notion decision problem
However really case since function problem recast decision problem
For example multiplication two integer expressed set triple relation hold
Deciding whether given triple member set corresponds solving problem multiplying two number
To measure difficulty solving computational problem one may wish see much time best algorithm requires solve problem
However running time may general depend instance
In particular larger instance require time solve
Thus time required solve problem space required measure complexity calculated function size instance
This usually taken size input bit
Complexity theory interested algorithm scale increase input size
For instance problem finding whether graph connected much time take solve problem graph vertex compared time taken graph vertex
If input size time taken expressed function
Since time taken different input size different time complexity T defined maximum time taken input size
If T polynomial algorithm said algorithm
say problem solved feasible amount resource admits polynomial time algorithm
A Turing machine mathematical model general computing machine
It theoretical device manipulates symbol contained strip tape
Turing machine intended practical computing technology rather thought experiment representing computing advanced supercomputer mathematician pencil paper
It believed problem solved algorithm exists Turing machine solves problem
Indeed statement
Furthermore known everything computed model computation known u today programming language computed Turing machine
Since Turing machine easy analyze mathematically believed powerful model computation Turing machine commonly used model complexity theory
Many type Turing machine used define complexity class
They equally powerful principle resource time space bounded may powerful others
A deterministic Turing machine basic Turing machine us fixed set rule determine future action
A probabilistic Turing machine deterministic Turing machine extra supply random bit
The ability make probabilistic decision often help algorithm solve problem efficiently
Algorithms use random bit called
A Turing machine deterministic Turing machine added feature allows Turing machine multiple possible future action given state
One way view Turing machine branch many possible computational path step solves problem branch said solved problem
Clearly model meant physically realizable model theoretically interesting abstract machine give rise particularly interesting complexity class
For example see
Many machine model different standard proposed literature example
Perhaps surprisingly model converted another without providing extra computational power
The time memory consumption alternate model may vary
What model common machine operate
However computational problem easier analyze term unusual resource
For example Turing machine computational model allowed branch check many different possibility
The Turing machine little physically want compute algorithm branching exactly capture many mathematical model want analyze important resource analyzing computational problem
For precise definition mean solve problem using given amount time space computational model used
The deterministic Turing machine input total number state transition step machine make halt output answer yes
A Turing machine said operate within time time required input length
A decision problem solved time exists Turing machine operating time solves problem
Since complexity theory interested classifying problem based difficulty one defines set problem based criterion
For instance set problem solvable within time deterministic Turing machine denoted
Analogous definition made space requirement
Although time space complexity resource viewed computational resource
Complexity measure generally defined
Other complexity measure used complexity theory include
The complexity algorithm often expressed using
The complexity refer three different way measuring time complexity complexity measure different input size
Since input size may faster solve others define following complexity For example consider deterministic sorting algorithm
This solves problem sorting list integer given input
The input sorted sorted reverse order algorithm take time case
If assume possible permutation input list equally likely average time taken sorting O log
The best case occurs pivoting divide list half also needing O log time
To classify computation time similar resource space consumption one interested proving upper lower bound minimum amount time required efficient algorithm solving given problem
The complexity algorithm usually taken complexity unless specified otherwise
Analyzing particular algorithm fall field
To show upper bound time complexity problem one need show particular algorithm running time
However proving lower bound much difficult since lower bound make statement possible algorithm solve given problem
The phrase possible algorithm includes algorithm known today algorithm might discovered future
To show lower bound problem requires showing algorithm time complexity lower
Upper lower bound usually stated using hide constant factor smaller term
This make bound independent specific detail computational model used
For instance big O notation one would write O
A set problem related complexity
Simpler complexity class defined following factor Of course complexity class complicated definition fit framework
Thus typical complexity class definition like following But bounding computation time concrete function often yield complexity class depend chosen machine model
For instance language binary string solved Turing machine necessarily requires quadratic time model Turing machine
If allow polynomial variation running time state time complexity two reasonable general model computation polynomially related Chapter
This form basis complexity class set decision problem solvable deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time
The corresponding set function problem
Many important complexity class defined bounding time space used algorithm
Some important complexity class decision problem defined manner following The class necessarily take account space needed represent problem
It turn PSPACE NPSPACE EXPSPACE NEXPSPACE
Other important complexity class include defined using defined using Boolean circuit defined using quantum Turing machine

Classes like defined using
class decision problem
For complexity class defined way desirable prove relaxing requirement say computation time indeed defines bigger set problem
In particular although DTIME contained DTIME would interesting know inclusion strict
For time space requirement answer question given time space hierarchy theorem respectively
They called hierarchy theorem induce proper hierarchy class defined constraining respective resource
Thus pair complexity class one properly included
Having deduced proper set inclusion proceed make quantitative statement much additional time space needed order increase number problem solved
More precisely state The state The time space hierarchy theorem form basis separation result complexity class
For instance time hierarchy theorem tell u P strictly contained EXPTIME space hierarchy theorem tell u L strictly contained PSPACE
Many complexity class defined using concept reduction
A reduction transformation one problem another problem
It capture informal notion problem least difficult another problem
For instance problem solved using algorithm difficult say
There many different type reduction based method reduction Cook reduction Karp reduction Levin reduction bound complexity reduction
The commonly used reduction reduction
This mean reduction process take polynomial time
For example problem squaring integer reduced problem multiplying two integer
This mean algorithm multiplying two integer used square integer
Indeed done giving input input multiplication algorithm
Thus see squaring difficult multiplication since squaring reduced multiplication
This motivates concept problem hard complexity class
A problem class problem every problem reduced
Thus problem harder since algorithm allows u solve problem
Of course notion hard problem depends type reduction used
For complexity class larger P reduction commonly used
In particular set problem hard NP set problem
If problem hard said
This mean hardest problem
Since many problem could equally hard one might say one hardest problem
Thus class problem contains difficult problem NP sense one likely Because problem P NP solved able reduce known problem Π another problem Π would indicate known solution Π
This solution Π would yield solution Π
Similarly NP problem reduced set finding problem solved polynomial time would mean P NP
The complexity class P often seen mathematical abstraction modeling computational task admit efficient algorithm
This hypothesis called
The complexity class hand contains many problem people would like solve efficiently efficient algorithm known
Since deterministic Turing machine special Turing machine easily observed problem P also member class NP
The question whether P equal NP one important open question theoretical computer science wide implication solution
If answer yes many important problem shown efficient solution
These include various type problem many problem ability find formal proof theorem
The P versus NP problem one proposed
There US prize resolving problem
It shown Ladner exist problem neither
Such problem called problem
The example problem believed
They NP problem known
The computational problem determining whether two finite

The answer known believed problem least
If graph isomorphism collapse second level
Since widely believed polynomial hierarchy collapse finite level believed graph isomorphism
The best algorithm problem due run time graph vertex although recent work Babai offer potentially new perspective
The computational problem determining given integer
Phrased decision problem problem deciding whether input prime factor le
No efficient integer factorization algorithm known fact form basis several modern cryptographic system algorithm
The integer factorization problem even UP
If problem polynomial time hierarchy collapse first level equal
The best known algorithm integer factorization take time factor integer
However best known problem run polynomial time
Unfortunately fact say much problem lie respect complexity class
Many known complexity class suspected unequal proved
For instance possible
If equal equal either
Since many known complexity class possible complexity class collapse one class
Proving class unequal would major breakthrough complexity theory
Along line class containing problem
problem answer reversed problem
It believed equal however yet proven
It clear two complexity class equal equal since would also since problem dual
Similarly known set problem solved logarithmic space strictly contained equal
Again many complexity class two known distinct equal class
It suspected equal
However currently open
A problem solved theory
given large finite resource especially time practice solution take many resource useful known
Conversely problem solved practice called literally problem handled
The term literally done sometimes used interchangeably though risk confusion
Tractable problem frequently identified problem solution known
Problems known intractable sense include
If NP P problem also intractable sense
However identification inexact solution large exponent large constant term grows quickly may impractical practical size problem conversely solution grows slowly may practical realistic input solution take long time worst case may take short time case average case thus still practical
Saying problem P imply large case problem hard even
For example decision problem shown P yet algorithm written solve problem reasonable time case
Similarly algorithm solve wide range size le quadratic time routinely handle large instance
To see algorithm generally unusable practice consider program make operation halting
For small say assuming sake example computer operation second program would run year order magnitude
Even much faster computer program would useful small instance sense intractability problem somewhat independent technological progress
However algorithm take operation practical get relatively large
Similarly polynomial time algorithm always practical
If running time say unreasonable consider efficient still useless except small instance
Indeed practice even algorithm often impractical realistic size problem
An early example algorithm complexity analysis running time analysis done
Before actual research explicitly devoted complexity algorithmic problem started numerous foundation laid various researcher
Most influential among definition Turing machine turned robust flexible simplification computer
The beginning systematic study computational complexity attributed seminal paper On Computational Complexity Algorithms laid definition proved hierarchy theorem
In addition suggested consider good algorithm one running time bounded polynomial input size
Earlier paper studying problem solvable Turing machine specific bounded resource include definition Myhill study rudimentary set well paper computation
Somewhat earlier pioneer field USSR studied another specific complexity measure
As remembers However initial interest automaton theory increasingly set aside favor computational complexity exciting fusion combinatorial method inherited conceptual arsenal theory algorithm
These idea occurred earlier I coined term signalizing function nowadays commonly known complexity measure
In developed axiomatic complexity theory based proved important result
The field really began flourish US researcher working independently USSR proved exist practically relevant problem
In took idea leap forward landmark paper Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems showed diverse problem infamous computational intractability

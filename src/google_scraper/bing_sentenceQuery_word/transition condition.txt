Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I currently hold BA Middle Eastern History pretty good fit last job Army
I getting ready move civillian world computer always hobby I like look turning career
My question Should I look getting second undergrad would programming education certificate enough get foot door school later
Are online certificate respected enough especially addition traditional degree
I basically want know set sight order get going software development
Getting additional qualification seems necessary kind make sense getting started
I think going depend vastly kind position want headed deep rabbit hole wish go
The one thing I would say ought focus fundamental No matter kind work end programming business process pursuing PhD getting fundamental straight pay dividend
Courses algorithm software engineering computer architecture give different view work matter
A CS undergraduate degree would good choice especially grad study want go
I understand vary quality though something bear mind
I teach aimed people like earned bachelor degree field CS want transition CS order go software engineering although also teaching
While quick cheap program usually better choice second bachelor degree since student take anything CS related math course many peer similar position
Depending aiming
working tech
company versus professor may enough qualification already
The programming industry still industry extremely forgiving qualification necessary work
This likely due age industry nature
If feel need traditional preparation site like others provide Massively Open Online Courses MOOC great place get CS course take Intro course advanced one free paid certificate also available
Also working real open source project one place start looking align interest skill proved capable great resume item
From written I think well spending time finding company need skill already hobbyist likely know lest one language pretty well practicing skill

Finite state machine class automaton studied
In computer science finite state machine widely used modeling application behavior design study computation language
Finite state machine subdivided transducer acceptor classifier sequencer
also called produce binary output indicating whether received input accepted
Each state FSM either accepting accepting
Once input received current state accepting state input accepted otherwise rejected
As rule input character action used
The example figure show finite state machine accepts string nice
In FSM accepting state state
A possibly infinite set symbol sequence aka
formal language called Finite State Machine accepts exactly set
For example set binary string even number zero regular language cf
Fig
set string whose length prime number
A machine could also described defining language would contain every string accepted machine none rejected one language accepted machine
By definition language accepted FSMs language regular FSM accepts
The problem determining language accepted given finite state acceptor instance generalization graph edge weighted element arbitrary
The start state also accepting state case automaton accepts empty string
An example accepting state appears DFA detects whether input string contains even number
also start state indicates state even number input
S therefore accepting state
This machine finish accept state binary string contains even number including binary string containing
Examples string accepted DFA etc
A generalization finite state machine similar acceptor produce single output termination two terminal state
generate output based given input state using action
They used control application field
In control application two type distinguished subclass acceptor transducer type
They produce one sequence seen output sequence acceptor transducer output
A distinction automaton
In deterministic automaton every state exactly one transition possible input
In automaton input lead one one transition given state
The algorithm transform nondeterministic automaton usually complex deterministic automaton identical functionality
A finite state machine one state called combinatorial FSM
It allows action upon transition state
This concept useful case number finite state machine required work together convenient consider purely combinatorial part form FSM suit design tool
There set semantics available represent state machine

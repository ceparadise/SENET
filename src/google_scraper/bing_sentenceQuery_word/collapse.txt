Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression
Protect Yourself Today
Enter email subscribe The Economic Collapse Blog Delivered What going happen society robot able everything better faster cheaper human worker
We live time technology increasing exponential pace
Incredible advancement robotics computer science artificial intelligence certainly making life comfortable also bringing fundamental change workplace
For employer lot advantage replacing human worker robot
Robots surf around Facebook supposed working
Robots need Obamacare lunch break vacation day
Robots never steal company never complain
Up fairly recently human worker could generally perform many task cheaply robot could rapidly changing
For example coffee shop opened San Francisco instead Tired barista misspelling name morning cup joe
Perhaps robot could better
On Monday opened first robotic cafe San Francisco Metreon shopping center
Promising precision crafted specialty coffee second way roaster intended Cafe X think anything human machine better
Specifically one special machine
Cafe X employee robot man robot two standard professional coffee machine order serve espresso latte
In San Francisco location customer grab cup coffee bean AKA Coffee Verve Coffee Roasters Peet
While coffee may make Cafe X stand competition startup hope robot efficiency
If coffee shop demonstrates much profitable coffee shop human employee matter time human baristas start phased nation
A similar thing happening many supermarket
Personally I hate line starting see everywhere day
And according Amazon playing around concept would employ hardly human worker In case Amazon automated retail prototype worker could staff average location
A manager duty would include signing customer
Another worker would restock shelf still another two would stationed window customer picking grocery style
The last pair would work upstairs helping robot bag grocery sent customer dumbwaiter conveyor source said
With payroll boost profit could huge
Indeed prototype discussed call operating profit margin north percent
That compare industry average percent according Food Marketing Institute
During recent presidential campaign much made fact shipped million good paying job overseas past several decade
We certainly try make law would keep American worker losing job foreign worker pretty soon worker world going losing million job technology going impossible make law prevent happening
Just check happening China
Many big firm moved manufacturing China labor much cheaper lot cheap Chinese worker Apple iPhone manufacturer Foxconn fact already begun automating certain work previously done hand
A Chinese government official May Foxconn replaced worker robot one factory
And company accelerate investment robotics replace human labor according Chinese state medium organization Xinhua
Sadly beginning
According one study activity currently performed human worker could already turned sort machine robot About worker activity turned sort machine robot increasingly helped along software
About CEOs plan cut job next five year robotics say plan hire people robotics
And Carl Frey Oxford University determined profession percent chance becoming automated The revelation dependable office job insurance worker real estate agent chance becoming computerised could spark fear among middle class workforce
While job exposed automation forthcoming decade substantial number job equally Frey told
Other job feature high risk list credit analyst chance losing job robot postal service worker lab technician chance seeing role become automated
So world going billion human worker around globe longer needed technology take virtually job
Some suggested idea work become thing past society evolve socialist utopia everything need provided government
In fact concept already promoted Europe elsewhere
But others see dystopian future gap have nots grows greater ever
Humanity always plagued poverty greed everyone agrees gap wealthy rest u
Where nearly universal agreement fact big change coming
Workers going displaced technology accelerating rate year ahead present tremendous challenge u

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

The collapse Wall Street may help make computer science IT career attractive student abandoned field drove pop last big bubble bust
William Dally chairman computer science department Stanford University said last several year watched student interested technology go field could lucrative
Many thought could make money hedge fund Dally said
He said student returning computer science like field necessarily make rich
John Gallaugher associate professor information system Carroll School Management Boston College said already seeing shift student interest
Students commented written course wikis considering changing finance major based appeal IS concern availability finance job future Gallaugher said
After bust computer science The number bachelor degree computer science awarded institution reached low academic year according Computing Research Association CRA Washington
Current economic condition seem impact choice student make major choose true computer science said Jay Vegso CRA analyst study computer science enrollment trend
Students choosing major might looking safer alternative said IT may safer alternative
The era wonderful time young search rich
Wall Street poured billion dollar hundred company making little money
For instance Webvan Group grocery delivery firm Foster City founded much money billion stock
Webvan ended Chapter bankruptcy
If meltdown enough offshore outsourcing also scared away student technology
In Carly Fiorina CEO offshore trend way There job America right anymore
Fiorina adviser Republican John McCain bid White House
Today company suffering shortage technology professional baby boomer retirement add problem
The pipeline inadequate IT professional said Jerry Luftman involved academic business associate dean Stevens Institute Technology Howe School Technology Management Hoboken vice president academic affair Society Information Management Chicago
The big difference today heyday period late type student business need Luftman said
Technical skill still important business also want hire student management industry training strong communication ability marketing negotiation skill said
According Bureau Labor Statistics IT job among fastest growing
On top bureau network system data communication analyst forecasting grow job job increase
Computer software engineer application expected increase computer scientist database administrator rise increase
Randal Bryant dean School Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh said school saw student application drop low peak end boom
But situation turning around past year application coming last year said
Bryant said expects trouble Wall Street likely influence student switch major coming month business field including computer science
He also urge caution student
I like tell student make career choice quickly based hottest month going graduating four year field may hot anymore Bryant said
I tell major something like likely fluctuation job market
Our peak period included people computer science particular aptitude thought get rich said

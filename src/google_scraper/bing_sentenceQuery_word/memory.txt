The performance CPU affected number core clock speed memory
There different type volatile memory
Computers require input hardware processing hardware output hardware
The hardware defines computer
Without computer could function
The CPU memory work together run program
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
Most computer CPU separate graphic processing unit GPU image
The GPU around time faster CPU
It optimised produce graphic game film
The GPU responsible handling image free CPU task
CPU memory speed affect overall speed computer
If one significantly slower slow others
test used ass performance computer
Different type benchmark software used different kind application might want computer
It difficult ass performance CPU computer might excel task well others
For example computer going used gaming require best combination hardware handle intensive graphic quickly
The computer might perform well used analyse vast amount scientific data

Computer physical device capable storing information temporarily permanently
For example Random Access Memory volatile memory store information used
Below example picture MB DIMM computer
This memory module connects computer
Memory either memory
memory loses content computer hardware device loses power
Computer RAM example volatile memory computer freeze reboots working program lose anything saved
sometimes abbreviated NVRAM memory keep content even power lost
example memory
As mentioned memory RAM volatile memory computer loses power anything stored RAM lost
For example working creating document stored RAM saved memory hard drive would lost computer lost power
It common new computer user confused part computer memory
Although RAM memory appropriate refer RAM memory hard drive
When someone asks much memory computer often GB Random Access Memory RAM several hundred gigabyte even hard disk drive storage
In word always hard drive space RAM
When program Internet open loaded hard drive placed RAM allows program communicate processor higher speed
Anything save computer picture video sent hard drive storage
All device computer operate speed computer memory give computer place quickly access data
If CPU wait secondary storage device like hard disk drive computer would much slower
Some common type memory chip computer listed
These type memory fall general category


Memory GCSE Computer Science Revision
Everyone benefit good memory
Right
You study math exam remember fact figure ready big day
You remember time
You even remember take pen
You remember fact figure write dazzling paper examiner stunned dazzling math skill give distinction
What kind memory get computer system
How work store data
Firstly let talk volatile memory memory
Volatile memory relies power source store information rather like needing concentrate fact sink
If pay attention class really bad memory fact go one ear remember thing
It volatile memory
As soon switch information lost
memory remains place even power switched
So instance could concentrating class take everything remember
When get home learned class reinforces knowledge stuffed inside head even go sleep switch something else like go dancing play football memory fact still retrieve
The third type memory called virtual memory
A computer system might using set allocation random access memory RAM need run another programme enough RAM
The computer grind halt tell enough space run extra programme would kindly shut one programme want continue
That problem need programme running
So system access extra space another part computer system copy hard drive
What concept transferring space
But give virtual memory run extra programme

Find pick best Computer Science Program Menu Memory management computer science involves control coordination computer memory system optimization overall system performance efficient memory storage
Tactics involved memory management machine hardware also way operating system application program function according Pieces computer hardware contribute storage memory management include RAM memory cache drive SSDs
In term operating system functioning memory management implicated way memory capacity machine shared various program operation given moment machine also way memory reused later additional program
A computer application influenced memory management task allocation recycling
The memory manager machine must allocate memory towards application way specified various memory management allocation technique
Furthermore memory longer needed application memory allocated certain point data stored using memory longer required
This recycling ability machine memory management feature come play
Those work developing memory management capability technique must succeed predicting data contained memory needed longer necessary
Memory typically short supply machine inefficient memory allocation detract machine performance
The following typical problem memory management programmer developer working memory management must constantly struggle Related Resource Memory management computer science manual automatic according
When memory management manual programmer directly control release previously used memory recycling
In automatic memory management memory recycling happens memory manager recycled memory block reached program variable
Memory management computer science continually developed advanced machine computer science technique increase complexity

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I came know graphic processing unit something called memory coalescing
On reading I clear topic
Is way related Memory Level Parallelism
I searched Google able obtain satisfactory answer
It would helpful someone give comprehensive explanation
Coalescing also refer
In usage coalescing used mean making sure thread run simultaneously try access memory nearby
This usually Therefore making program use predictable memory pattern important
It even important threaded program memory request jump otherwise processing unit waiting memory request fulfilled
Diagrams inspired Below Four thread uniform memory access
The black dashed rectangle represents single memory request
The memory access close retrieved one least number request
However increase access thread require many memory access
Below four thread stride two
Here see thread require memory block request
The smaller stride better
The wider stride request potentially required
Of course worse large memory stride random memory access pattern
These nearly impossible pipeline cache predict
I think I see two us word coalescing around net memory
One referred wikipedia page linked question
When allocating memory sometimes memory manager situation two adjacent memory block freed
Combining would make single freed memory block called coalescing
Example Starting allocated block Later one freed And later another freed Now two adjacent free block
Coalescing Coalescing occur soon possible example garbage collector collector run

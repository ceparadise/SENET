A unit measurement express amount business functionality product provides user
Function point used compute functional size measurement FSM software
The cost dollar hour single unit calculated past project
As several recognized standard public specification sizing software based Function Point
open membership computer industry standard consortium adopted Automated Function Point AFP specification led
It provides standard automating Function Point counting according guideline International Function Point User Group However current implementation standard limitation able distinguish External Output EO External Inquiries EQ box without upfront configuration
Function point defined Allan Albrecht
The software identified one categorized one five type output inquiry input internal file external interface
Once function identified categorized type assessed complexity assigned number function point
Each functional user requirement map business function data entry Input user query Inquiry
This distinction important tends make function measured function point map easily requirement also tends hide internal function
algorithm also require resource implement
There currently ISO recognized FSM Method includes algorithmic complexity sizing result
Recently different approach proposed deal perceived weakness implemented several commercial software product
The variation IFPUG method designed make weakness include The use function point favor line code seek address several additional issue Albrecht observed research Function Points highly correlated line code resulted questioning value measure objective measure namely counting line code available
In addition multiple attempt address perceived shortcoming measure augmenting counting regimen
Others offered solution circumvent challenge developing alternative method create proxy amount functionality delivered

Software system unless thoroughly understood like ice berg
They becoming difficult understand
Improvement coding tool allows software developer produce large amount software meet ever expanding need user
As system grow method understand communicate size need used
Function Point Analysis structured technique problem solving
It method break system smaller component better understood analyzed
Function point unit measure software much like hour measuring time mile measuring distance Celsius measuring temperature
Function Points ordinal measure much like measure kilometer Fahrenheit hour forth Human being solve problem breaking smaller understandable piece
Problems may appear difficult simple broken smaller part dissected class
Classifying thing placing category familiar process
Everyone one time another shopkeeper take stock shelf librarian catalog book secretary file letter document
When object classified content system set definition rule must used place object appropriate category scheme classification
Function Point Analysis structured technique classifying component system
It method break system smaller component better understood analyzed
It provides structured technique problem solving
In world Function Point Analysis system divided five large class general system characteristic
The first three class component External Inputs External Outputs External Inquires component transact file therefore called transaction
The next two Internal Logical Files External Interface Files data stored combined form logical information
The general system characteristic ass general functionality system
Brief History Function Point Analysis developed first Allan Albrecht mid
It attempt overcome difficulty associated line code measure software size assist developing mechanism predict effort associated software development
The method first published later
In Albrecht refined method since International Function Point User Group IFPUG set several version Function Point Counting Practices Manual published IFPUG
The current version IFPUG Manual

Objectives Function Point Analysis Frequently term end user user used without specifying meant
In case user sophisticated user
Someone would understand system functional perspective likely someone would provide requirement acceptance testing
Since Function Points measure system functional perspective independent technology
Regardless language development method hardware platform used number function point system remain constant
The variable amount effort needed deliver given set function point therefore Function Point Analysis used determine whether tool environment language productive compared others within organization among organization
This critical point one greatest value Function Point Analysis
Function Point Analysis provide mechanism track monitor scope creep
Function Point Counts end requirement analysis design code testing implementation compared
The function point count end requirement design compared function point actually delivered
If project grown scope creep
The amount growth indication well requirement gathered communicated project team
If amount growth project decline time natural assumption communication user improved
Characteristic Quality Function Point Analysis Function Point Analysis performed trained experienced personnel
If Function Point Analysis conducted untrained personnel reasonable assume analysis done incorrectly
The personnel counting function point utilize current version Function Point Counting Practices Manual Current application documentation utilized complete function point count
For example screen format report layout listing interface system system logical preliminary physical data model assist Function Points Analysis
The task counting function point included part overall project plan
That counting function point scheduled planned
The first function point count developed provide sizing used estimating
The Five Major Components Since common computer system interact computer system boundary must drawn around system measured prior classifying component
This boundary must drawn according point view
In short boundary indicates border project application measured external application user domain
Once border established component classified ranked tallied
elementary process data cross boundary outside inside
This data may come data input screen another application
The data may used maintain one internal logical file
The data either control information business information
If data control information update internal logical file
The graphic represents simple EI update ILF FTR

elementary process derived data pass across boundary inside outside
Additionally EO may update ILF
The data creates report output file sent application
These report file created one internal logical file external interface file
The following graphic represents EO FTR derived information green derived ILF elementary process input output component result data retrieval one internal logical file external interface file
The input process update Internal Logical Files output side contain derived data
The graphic represents EQ two ILF derived data
user identifiable group logically related data resides entirely within application boundary maintained external input
user identifiable group logically related data used reference purpose
The data resides entirely outside application maintained another application
The external interface file internal logical file another application
After component classified one five major component ranking low average high assigned
For transaction ranking based upon number file updated referenced number data element type
For file ranking based upon record element type data element type
A record element type user recognizable subgroup data element within ILF EIF
A data element type unique user recognizable non recursive field
Each following table assist ranking process numerical rating parenthesis
For example EI reference update File Types Referenced data element would assigned ranking average associated rating
Where combined number Internal Logical Files referenced updated External Interface Files referenced
Like component rated scored
Basically EQ rated Low Average High like EO assigned value like EI
The rating based upon total number unique combined unique input side data element file type referenced combined unique input output side
If FTR used input output side counted one time
If DET used input output side counted one time
For number record element type number data element type used determine ranking low average high
A Record Element Type user recognizable subgroup data element within ILF EIF
A Data Element Type DET unique user recognizable non recursive field ILF EIF
The count level complexity type component entered table following one
Each count multiplied numerical rating shown determine rated value
The rated value row summed across table giving total value type component
These total summed across table giving total value type component
These total summoned arrive Total Number Unadjusted Function Points
The value adjustment factor VAF based general system characteristic GSC rate general functionality application counted
Each characteristic associated description help determine degree influence characteristic
The degree influence range scale zero five influence strong influence
The IFPUG Counting Practices Manual provides detailed evaluation criterion GSC table intended provide overview GSC

FP UAF VAF Summary benefit Function Point Analysis Function Points used size software application accurately
Sizing important component determining productivity
They counted different people different time obtain measure within reasonable margin error
Function Points easily understood non technical user
This help communicate sizing information user customer
Function Points used determine whether tool language environment productive compared others
For complete list us benefit FP please see online article
Conclusions Accurately predicting size software plagued software industry year
Function Points becoming widely accepted standard metric measuring software size
Now Function Points made adequate sizing possible anticipated overall rate progress software productivity software quality improve
Understanding software size key understanding productivity quality
Without reliable sizing metric relative change productivity Function Points per Work Month relative change quality Defects per Function Point calculated
If relative change productivity quality calculated plotted time focus put upon organization strength weakness
Most important attempt correct weakness measured effectiveness

I keep coming across reference question answer stackexchange I look meaning web obviously finding reference site Wikipedia
However none reference really answer question fixed point mean world computer science
In computer science arguably prominent use
A lattice partially ordered set S additional property given two element x S set x supremum infimum S
Now often consider function f lattice converge x S f x
Important result area
A prominent example lattice A set f induced inductive definition
For example let A define language L align w L L aw L baw L bw L abw bbw L align This inductive definition corresponds monotone function f A A baw aw abw bbw bw By theorem know f smallest fixpoint supremum smaller intermediate result correspond finitely often applying constructor inductive definition smallest fixpoint indeed L
By way fixpoint also us see example
In recursion theory another theorem also due Kleene
It Let r N N total computable function intuition compiler
Then N r
In fact even infinitely many finitely many could patch r contradicting theorem
Let elaborate bit meisterluk answer Imagine trying define factorial function remember definition factorial function Now PL framework namely immediately obvious define function
However may easy define following function take input function natural number There use recursion function definition
However way finding function Fact n n every n easy check indeed implementation factorial function
Now framework like one nature fact exist make clear use general programing language
There many us notion computer science boil one I showed
prove certain exist able show certain function construct framework shown factorial function exists
A fixed point function f A A element x f x equal x
For example function two fixed point value function three fixed point
Mathematically definition
Now depending mathematical structure dealing many different reason interested fixed point
For example consider dynamic system look state world change like thermostat fixed point corresponds stable configuration
If think game mathematical sense game theory fixed point correspond equillibria think behaviour optimization routine iteratively improves solution fixed point corresponds optimal solution
So mathematical notion fixed point lot application lot different context
A common fundamental application fixed point computer science mathematically model loop recursive program
If try model program mathematical function loop recursion obvious model
This body loop program represented mathematical function
How derive function representing loop behaviour
It corresponds applying loop body repeatedly conjunction loop guard change possible
Similarly model recursive program mathematically need mathematical notion mean function apply
This answer provided fixed point
A function mathematics map input output value
Fixed point input value function map output value satisfying equality input
For equality function f x x set input value equal set fixed point function
For function f x set fixed point limited
As far computer science concerned talking lot change definition fixed point u
You might also confused totally different topic concept represent real number memory
But name fixed point reference topic general point
major subarea CS important concept fixed point theorem

In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

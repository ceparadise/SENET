operand specified implicitly definition instruction
Example
It mainly used instruction
operand specified instruction mainly constant
Example question come check First one zero address instruction Stack based second accumulator instruction instruction operand defined instruction
Which addressing mode preferred
How check whether instruction implied immediate
Thank Implied Not specified directly
Operands address explicity specified
Take Zero address Stack organization example
Here operand directly specified
The two top element stack popped added
Note operand directly present instruction
IMPLIED Immediate This quite simple operand direcly present address field
Address field like operand field
An instruction like PUSH two operand implicit destination explicit source
Implicit register immediate property operand whole instruction
This question seem make sense
An instruction operand category could said use implicit operand example

two operand implicit
one operand register memory

Instruction Format Addressing Modes available

aspect CPU design
The various addressing mode defined given instruction set architecture define architecture identify instruction
An addressing mode specifies calculate effective operand using information held constant contained within machine instruction elsewhere
In addressing mode primarily interest writer write
Note generally accepted way naming various addressing mode
In particular different author computer manufacturer may give different name addressing mode name different addressing mode
Furthermore addressing mode one given architecture treated single addressing mode may represent functionality another architecture covered two addressing mode
For example CISC architecture treat register another addressing mode
Others successor RISC design encode information within instruction
Thus latter machine three distinct instruction code copying one register another copying literal constant register copying content memory location register VAX single MOV instruction
The term addressing mode subject different interpretation either memory address calculation mode operand accessing mode
Under first interpretation instruction read memory write memory add literal register considered addressing mode
The second interpretation allows machine VAX use operand mode bit allow register literal operand
Only first interpretation applies instruction load effective address
The addressing mode listed divided code addressing data addressing
Most computer architecture maintain distinction architecture allow almost addressing mode used context
The instruction shown purely representative order illustrate addressing mode necessarily reflect mnemonic used particular computer
Different computer architecture vary greatly number addressing mode provide hardware
There benefit eliminating complex addressing mode using one simpler addressing mode even though requires extra instruction perhaps extra register
It proven much easier design CPUs addressing mode available simple one
Most RISC architecture five simple addressing mode CISC architecture DEC VAX dozen addressing mode quite complicated
The IBM architecture three addressing mode added
When addressing mode particular addressing mode required usually encoded within instruction code
IBM successor RISC
But lot addressing mode specific field often set aside instruction specify addressing mode
The DEC VAX allowed multiple memory operand almost instruction reserved first operand specifier indicate addressing mode particular operand
Keeping addressing mode specifier bit separate opcode operation bit produce
Even computer many addressing mode measurement actual program indicate simple addressing mode listed account addressing mode used
Since measurement based code generated language compiler reflects extent limitation compiler used
Some instruction set architecture successor instruction
This performs calculation effective operand address instead acting memory location load address would accessed register
This useful passing address array element subroutine
It may also slightly sneaky way calculation normal one instruction example using instruction addressing mode detailed allows one add two register constant together one instruction
The effective address absolute instruction address address parameter modification
The effective address instruction address offset parameter added address next instruction
This offset usually signed allow reference code instruction
This particularly useful connection jump typical jump nearby instruction language statement reasonably short
Measurements actual program suggest bit offset large enough conditional jump roughly byte
Another advantage addressing code may
loaded anywhere memory without need adjust address
Some version addressing mode may conditional referring two register jump one register jump unless register implicitly referring bit

The effective address Register indirect instruction address specified register
For example access content address register
The effect transfer control instruction whose address specified register
Many RISC machine well CISC successor subroutine call instruction place address addressing mode used return subroutine call
The CPU executing sequential instruction immediately executes following instruction
Sequential execution considered addressing mode computer
Most instruction CPU architecture sequential instruction
Because instruction sequential instruction CPU designer often add feature deliberately sacrifice performance order make sequential instruction run faster
Conditional branch load PC one possible result depending CPU architecture use addressing mode taken branch sequential execution taken branch
Many feature modern CPUs complex etc
maintain illusion instruction finish next one begin giving final result even though exactly happens internally
Each sequential instruction exhibit temporal spatial
CPUs use sequential execution program counter extremely rare
In CPUs instruction always specifies address next instruction
Such CPUs instruction pointer hold specified address program counter provision incrementing
Such CPUs include computer RTX
Other computing architecture go much attempting bypass using variety
Some computer architecture conditional instruction longer instruction mode conditional load instruction case make conditional branch unnecessary avoid flushing
An instruction used set subsequent instruction include test condition code see whether obeyed ignored
Skip addressing may considered special kind addressing mode fixed offset
Like addressing CPUs version addressing mode refer one register skip register implicitly referring bit
Other CPUs version selects specific bit specific byte test skip bit
Unlike conditional branch skip instruction never need flush though may need cause next instruction ignored
This addressing mode effective address considered addressing mode computer
In example operand register result placed register
This sometimes referred plus displacement The usually signed value though expanded bit
If offset zero becomes example addressing effective address value base register
On many RISC machine register fixed value zero
If register used base register becomes example
However small portion memory accessed offset bit
The offset may seem small relation size current computer memory expanded
It could worse IBM mainframe unsigned offset
However principle applies short time span data item program want access fairly close
This addressing mode closely related indexed absolute addressing mode
Within subroutine programmer mainly interested parameter local variable rarely exceed one base register suffices
If routine class method language second base register needed point attribute current object high level language
If base register contains address record structure offset used select field record le kB size
This addressing mode effective address considered addressing mode computer
The constant might signed unsigned
For example move immediate hex value FEEDABBA register
Instead using operand memory value operand held within instruction
On DEC VAX machine literal operand size could bit long
showed constant program would fit bit see
The implied addressing mode also called implicit addressing mode explicitly specify effective address either source destination sometimes
Either source destination effective address sometimes implied opcode
Implied addressing quite common older computer
Such computer typically single register arithmetic could accumulator
Such implicitly reference accumulator almost every instruction
For example operation b c done using sequence load b add c store destination accumulator implied every load add instruction source accumulator implied every store instruction
Later computer generally one RAM location could source destination later computer need addressing mode specify source destination arithmetic
Among instruction use implicit register one operand result multiplication division counting conditional jump
Many computer AVR one register called implicitly incremented decremented pushing popping data stack source destination effective address implicitly address stored stack pointer
Many computer ARM PowerPC one register could used stack use register autoincrement indirect addressing mode specify register used pushing popping data stack
Some current computer architecture
Intel Pentium contain instruction implicit operand order maintain backwards compatibility earlier design
On many computer instruction flip mode bit bit etc
implicitly specify special register hold bit
This simplifies hardware necessary trap instruction order meet system trap logic need look operand final effective address opcode
A CPUs designed every operand always implicitly specified every instruction CPUs
This requires space instruction quite large address
It often available CISC machine instruction
Some RISC machine special instruction place constant top half register
That used base register addressing mode supply bit
The combination allows full address
This also requires space instruction quite large address
The address could start array vector index could select particular array element required
The processor may scale index register allow
Note le addressing mode except offset case large enough address memory location
Within subroutine programmer may define string local constant
The address string stored literal address instruction
The character string use iteration stored index register
A programmer may define several large array globals
The start array stored literal address perhaps modified time instruction reference
The item array use iteration stored index register
Often instruction loop register loop counter offset several array
The base register could contain start address array vector index could select particular array element required
The processor may scale allow
This could used accessing element array passed parameter
The base register could contain start address array vector record index could select particular record required offset could select field within record
The processor may scale index register allow
The base register could contain start address array index could contain offset one particular array element required
This addressing mode dynamically scale value index register allow size array element
array element double precision number occupying byte value index register multiplied used effective address calculation
The scale factor normally restricted rather multiplication used
A computer distinct addressing mode
Many computer use offset value
For example After determining effective address value base register incremented size data item accessed
For example would access content address register increase address pointer usually word
Within loop addressing mode used step element array vector
In language often thought good idea function return result lack side effect make program understanding validation much easier
This addressing mode side effect base register altered
If subsequent memory access cause error
page fault bus error address error leading interrupt restarting instruction becomes much problematic since one register may need set back state instruction originally started
There least two computer architecture implementation problem regard recovery interrupt addressing mode used Before determining effective address value base register decremented size data item accessed
Within loop addressing mode used step backwards element array vector
A stack implemented using mode conjunction previous addressing mode autoincrement
See discussion
Any addressing mode mentioned article could extra bit indicate indirect addressing
address calculated using mode fact address location typically complete contains actual effective address
Indirect addressing may used code data
It make implementation much easier also make easier call subroutine otherwise addressable
Indirect addressing carry performance penalty due extra memory access involved
Some early minicomputer
DEC register limited addressing range bit
Hence use memory indirect addressing almost way referring significant amount memory
The addressing mode used load register value stored program memory short distance away current instruction
It seen special case base plus offset addressing mode one selects program counter PC base register
There CPUs support data reference
Such CPUs include The architecture architecture addressing mode called literal
The also support addressing mode
The architecture architecture support addressing PC register file
When addressing mode used compiler typically place constant immediately immediately subroutine us prevent accidentally executing constant instruction
This addressing mode always fetch data memory store data memory sequentially fall execute next instruction effective address point data confused branch fetch data store data memory instead branch instruction given offset effective address point executable instruction
The addressing mode listed used period longer available current computer
This list mean complete many interesting peculiar addressing mode used time time
two three index register
If word size larger address word referenced addressing could indirect flag set indicate another memory indirect cycle
This flag referred resulting pointer indirection bit tagging whether direct pointer indirect pointer
Care needed ensure chain indirect address refer one get trying resolve address
The series memory indirect could enter infinite address calculation loop
The memory indirect addressing mode Nova influenced invention
The DEC computer address word allowed indirect addressing possibility using index register stage well
On computer register regarded occupying first word memory
DEC
This meant need separate add register register instruction one could use add memory register instruction
In case early model cache memory tight inner loop loaded first word memory fast register addressable installed ran much faster would magnetic core memory
Later model DEC series mapped register onto address area primarily intended allow remote diagnostics
Confusingly register mapped onto consecutive byte address
The DEC minicomputer eight special location address
When accessed via memory indirect addressing location would automatically increment use
This made easy step memory loop without needing use register handle step
The minicomputer special memory location address
When accessed via memory indirect addressing would automatically increment use would automatically decrement use
The family family processor family processor internal register
Arithmetic logical instruction mostly performed value memory opposed internal register
As result many instruction required location memory
Given opcodes processor one byte bit length memory address could make significant part code size
Designers processor included partial remedy known zero page addressing
The initial byte memory page could accessed using absolute indexed memory address
This reduced instruction execution time one clock cycle instruction length one byte
By storing data region program could made smaller faster
As result zero page used similarly register file
On many system however resulted high utilization zero page memory area operating system user program limited use since free space limited
The zero page address mode enhanced several late model processor including
The new mode known direct page addressing added ability move zero page memory window start memory offset address new location within first KB memory
The CSG allowed direct page moved boundary within first KB memory storing offset value new base page B register
The Motorola could direct page DP register
The WDC went step allowed direct page moved location within first KB memory storing offset value new direct D register
As result greater number program able utilize enhanced direct page addressing mode versus legacy processor included zero page addressing mode
This similar scaled index addressing except instruction two extra operand typically constant hardware check index value bound
Another variation us vector descriptor hold bound make easy implement dynamically allocated array still full bound checking
The DEC computer used word
It special instruction allowed memory treated sequence byte byte could size bit bit
A sequence descriptor memory called byte pointer held current word address within sequence bit position within word size byte
Instructions existed load store byte via descriptor increment descriptor point next byte byte split across word boundary
Much DEC software used five byte per word plain ASCII character one bit per word unused
Implementations use four byte per word since function C assumes size multiple size actual multiple determined operator
The used absolute addressing index register
Thus indirect jump jump register supported instruction set
Instead could instructed
Adding small value next instruction executed could example change thus creating effect indexed jump
Note instruction modified remains unchanged memory

If value added next instruction large enough could modify opcode instruction well instead address

Addressing mode convention used assembly language programming specify certain value read within given segment assembly instruction
There multiple possible mode based two common immediate direct

In composed pair possible key appears collection
Operations associated data type allow The classic computer science problem task designing maintains set data operation
The two major solution dictionary problem
In case also possible solve problem using directly addressed specialized structure
Many programming language include associative array available many others
form direct support associative array
Associative array many application including fundamental
In associative array association key value often known binding word binding may also used refer process creating new association
The operation usually defined associative array Often instead add reassign single operation add new pair one already exist otherwise reassigns
In addition associative array may also include operation determining number binding constructing loop binding
Usually operation order binding returned may arbitrary
A generalizes associative array allowing multiple value associated single key
A related abstract data type binding operate direction value must associated unique key second lookup operation take value argument look key associated value
Suppose set loan made library represented data structure
Each book library may checked single library patron time
However single patron may able check multiple book
Therefore information book checked patron may represented associative array book key patron value
Using notation data structure would A lookup operation key Great Expectations would return John
If John return book would cause deletion operation Pat check book would cause insertion operation leading different state For dictionary small number binding may make sense implement dictionary using binding
With implementation time perform basic dictionary operation linear total number binding however easy implement constant factor running time small
Another simple implementation technique usable key restricted narrow range integer direct addressing array value given key stored array cell binding cell store special indicates absence binding
As well simple technique fast dictionary operation take constant time
However space requirement structure size entire keyspace making impractical unless keyspace small
The two major approach implementing dictionary
The frequently used general purpose implementation associative array combined separate key separate bucket array
The basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple operation
Therefore average overhead operation hash table computation key hash combined accessing corresponding bucket within array
As hash table usually perform O time outperform alternative situation
Hash table need able handle hash function map two different key bucket array
The two widespread approach problem
In separate chaining array store value store another container usually store value matching hash
On hand open addressing hash collision found table seek empty spot array store value deterministic manner usually looking next immediate position array
Open addressing lower ratio separate chaining table mostly empty
However table becomes filled element open addressing performance degrades exponentially
Additionally separate chaining us le memory case unless entry small le four time size pointer
Another common approach implement associative array
Compared hash table structure advantage weakness
The performance binary search tree significantly better hash table time complexity O log
This contrast hash table whose performance involves element sharing single bucket resulting O time complexity
In addition like binary search tree binary search tree keep element order
Thus traversing element follows pattern whereas traversing hash table result element seemingly random order
However hash table much better time complexity binary search tree O performance highly unlikely good used
It worth noting binary search tree used implement bucket hash table us separate chaining
This allows constant lookup assures performance O log
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element linked list similar data structure
Associative array may also stored unbalanced data structure specialized particular type key implementation method le efficient hash table well placing greater restriction type data handle
The advantage alternative structure come ability handle operation beyond basic one associative array finding binding whose key closest queried key query present set binding
Associative array implemented programming language package many language system provide part standard library
In language built standard system special syntax often using subscripting
syntactic support associative array introduced name table
made associative array optionally persistent key data structure
supported one possible implementation set map
Most modern scripting language starting including support associative array primary container type
In many language available library function without special syntax
In called called called see called since typically use implementation
In array associative except key limited integer string
In JavaScript see also object behave associative array key Map WeakMap type take arbitrary object key
In Lua called used primitive building block data structure
In called
The also support associative array
Most program using associative array point need store data permanent form like
A common solution problem generalized concept known produce text binary representation original object written directly file
This commonly implemented underlying object model like Cocoa include standard function convert internal data text form
The program create complete text representation group object calling method almost always already implemented base associative array class
For program use large data set sort individual file storage appropriate DB required
Some DB system natively store associative array serializing data storing serialized data key
Individual array loaded saved database using key refer
These used many year history long common RDBs lack standardization among reason limited use certain niche role
RDBs used role case although saving object RDB complicated problem known
After need high performance database suitable closely matching internal structure program using led renaissance store market
These system store retrieve associative array native fashion greatly improve performance common workflow

Is wonder need create different type memory
Or related create memory different purpose
Certainly
In fact one important computer hardware research area today
One particular associative memory
set storage location accessed address
Think like house street
If wanted send package letter neighbor would send address would get stored house
Simple right
also set storage location work little differently
Instead looking storage location address look storage location content
So wanted send package letter neighbor would send house neighbor actually located would get stored
You would use associative memory regular memory situation speed recognizing pattern performing look ups make bulk processing
Why
Because finding neighbor address determining location address slower determining location directly neighbor
It take one le step
You convert neighbor address finding location

Given grammar follows A B I think grammar right associative expands right
Where I confused expanded using left
For example Could expanded via left I think
Does make associativity ambiguous
Assuming could ambiguous would I fix make grammar completely right associative
could certainly expand
But operator expansion one certainly would
So associativity apply since associativity expression involving two operator
So yes operator production grammar operator

In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

The second definition functional programming map applies function take list function applies function element list order return list result
What origin different definition map
I guessing second definition might come I sure derived another useful
The first definition make intuitive sense I sure came
Both construct define map mathematical sense mapping element one set another

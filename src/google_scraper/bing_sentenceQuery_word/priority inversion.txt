In problematic scenario high priority indirectly lower priority task effectively inverting relative priority two task
This violates priority model high priority task prevented running higher priority task briefly low priority task quickly complete use resource shared high low priority task
Consider two task high low priority respectively either acquire exclusive use shared resource
If attempt acquire acquired becomes blocked relinquishes resource
Sharing resource case system typically involves relinquishing promptly higher priority task stay blocked excessive period time
Despite good design however possible third task medium priority represents priority task becomes runnable use
At point higher priority preempt causing able relinquish promptly turn causing highest priority unable run
This called higher priority task preempted lower priority one
In case priority inversion occur without causing immediate delayed execution high priority task go unnoticed eventually low priority task release shared resource
However also many situation priority inversion cause serious problem
If high priority task left resource might lead system malfunction triggering corrective measure resetting entire system
The trouble experienced Mars lander classic example problem caused priority inversion system
Priority inversion also reduce system
Low priority task usually low priority important finish promptly example might another activity
Similarly high priority task high priority likely subject strict time may providing data interactive user acting subject realtime response guarantee
Because priority inversion result execution lower priority task blocking high priority task lead reduced system responsiveness even violation response time guarantee
A similar problem called occur within EDF
The existence problem known since
Lampson Redell published one first paper point priority inversion problem
Systems UNIX kernel already addressing problem splx primitive

I understand difference Hoare Mesa monitor
However I understand priority inversion lower priority process get done higher priority process possible Hoare type possible Mesa type
Can someone explain
Unless careful possible either Hoare type Mesa type monitor
This monitor implement form one process monitor time mutual exclusion priority mix well
Boosting priority thread monitor mitigates completely solve problem
Priority boosting typically done either
Hoare type condition variable introduce additional priority inversion problem though
In Hoare type condition variable thread may condition variable thus giving monitor lock thread could run make condition true condition variable
In Hoare type condition variable high priority thread immediately loses monitor lock give thread
In Mesa type condition variable particular priority inversion wo happen
The thread condition variable giving monitor lock
Then thread run make condition true condition variable
The thread give monitor lock keep running

Let u first put priority inversion context Big Picture
come
In Operating System one important concept Task Scheduling
There several Scheduling method First Come First Serve Round Robin Priority based scheduling etc
Each scheduling method pro con
As might guessed Priority Inversion come Priority based Scheduling
Basically problem arises sometimes Priority based scheduling used OS
In Priority based scheduling different task given different priority higher priority task intervene lower priority task possible
So priority based scheduling lower priority task L running higher priority task H also need run lower priority task L would preempted higher priority task H
Now suppose lower higher priority task need share common resource say access file device achieve respective work
In case since resource sharing task synchronization needed several used handling scenario
For sake topic Priority Inversion let u mention synchronization method say mutex
Just recap mutex task acquires mutex entering critical section CS release mutex exiting critical section CS
While running CS task access common resource
More detail referred
Now say L H share common Critical Section CS
mutex needed CS
Coming discussion priority inversion let u examine scenario
L running CS H need run H preempt L H start running H relinquishes release control L resume start running L running CS H need run CS H preempt L H start running H relinquishes control L resume start running
L running CS H also need run CS H wait L come CS L come CS H enters CS start running Please note scenario show problem Priority Inversion even scenario
Basically long lower priority task running shared CS higher priority task preempt
But L running shared CS H also need run CS H wait L come CS
The idea CS small enough result H waiting long time L CS
That writing CS code requires careful consideration
In scenario priority inversion
reversal priority occur task running per design
Now let u add another task middle priority say Now task priority order L M In example M share Critical Section CS
In case following sequence task running would result Priority Inversion problem
L running CS H also need run CS H wait L come CS M interrupt L start running M run till completion relinquishes control L resume start running till end CS H enters CS start running
Note neither L H share CS Here see running M delayed running L Precisely speaking H higher priority share CS M H wait This Priority based scheduling work expected priority M H got inverted spite sharing CS
This problem called Priority Inversion
This heck Priority Inversion
In system priority based scheduling higher priority task face problem result unexpected
In general purpose OS result slower performance
In RTOS result severe outcome
The famous Priority Inversion problem happened Mars Pathfinder
If problem solution
For Priority Inversion well different solution Priority Inheritance etc
This going next article But inpatient referred time

I heard phrase inversion reference development operating system
What exactly priority inversion
What problem meant solve solve
Priority inversion problem solution
The typical example low priority process acquiring resource high priority process need preempted medium priority process high priority process blocked resource medium priority one finish effectively executed lower priority
A rather famous example problem experienced Mars Pathfinder rover pretty interesting read
Imagine three task different priority tLow tMed tHigh
tLow tHigh access critical resource different time tMed thing
tHigh run tLow give resource
tLow run tMed block end
The priority task inverted tHigh though highest priority bottom execution chain
To solve priority inversion priority tLow must bumped least high tHigh
Some may bump priority highest possible priority level
Just important bumping priority level tLow dropping priority level tLow appropriate time
Different system take different approach
When drop priority tLow
Method improvement method shortens length time tLow priority level bumped
Note priority level stay bumped tHigh priority level period
Method allows priority level tLow step increment necessary instead one step
Different system implement different method depending upon factor consider important
Hope help
Priority Inversion Problem Lets Consider one example Tasks High Priority H Medium Priority M Low Priority L lock X may X
Scenario
L run acquires X
Then H try access X L semaphore H sleep


M finish H ca enter L lock L run

L finish relinquishes lock
Now H get lock executes
H highest priority ran lower priority process run
This Priority Inversion
When low priority process running lock high priority process try acquire lock priority low priority process raised priority high priority process
That L running lock H try acquire L priority raised H duration L hold lock
This way M ca
After L finish H run acquires lock
After H done M run preserving priority ordering
It rather solution
It describes situation thread obtain lock work thread wait finish might take especially long since
The inversion thread continue thread effect also low priority
A common solution thread temporarily inherit high priority everyone waiting lock hold
Suppose application three thread Thread thread sleeping blocked beginning example
Thread run enters critical section
At moment thread start running preempting thread thread higher priority
So thread continues critical section
Later thread start running preempting thread
Thread try enter critical section thread owns owned another thread thread block waiting critical section
At point thread start running higher priority thread thread running
Thread never release critical section thread waiting thread continues run
Therefore thread system thread becomes blocked waiting thread run
Assume Low process LP Medium Process MP High process HP LP executing critical section
While entering critical section LP must acquired lock object say OBJ
LP inside critical section
Meanwhile HP created
Because higher priority CPU context switch HP executing critical section code
At point HP execution need lock OBJ may may critical section lock OBJ still held LP since executing critical section
LP relinquish process READY state RUNNING
Now HP moved BLOCKED WAITING state
Now MP come executes code
MP need lock OBJ keep executing normally
HP wait LP release lock LP wait MP finish executing LP come back RUNNING state execute release lock
Only LP released lock HP come back READY go RUNNING low priority task
So effectively mean MP finish LP execute hence HP execute
So seems like HP waiting MP even though directly related OBJ lock

A solution Priority Inversion increase priority process A maximum priority process waiting resource A resource lock
Priority inversion lower priority process get ahold resource higher priority process need preventing higher priority process proceeding till resource freed
eg FileA need accessed
Proc higher priority manages open FileA first
Normally would run maybe time often wo able anything holding file
So end happening block finish FileA essentially priority hold FileA handle
As far problem go priority inversion problem keep happening
The worst case operating system wo let happen though allowed run
This would cause system lock would keep getting assigned CPU time never get CPU time file never released
Priority inversion occurs Given process H M L name stand high medium low priority H L share common resource
Say L acquires resource first start running
Since H also need resource enters waiting queue
M share resource start run hence
When L interrupted mean M take running state since higher priority running instant interrupt happens
Although H higher priority M since waiting queue acquire resource implying lower priority even After M finish L take CPU causing H wait whole time
Priority Inversion avoided blocked high priority thread transfer high priority low priority thread holding onto resource
A scheduling challenge arises process need read modify kernel data currently accessed chain process
Since kernel data typically protected lock process wait one resource
The situation becomes complicated process preempted favor another process higher priority
As example assume three M priority follow order L M Assume process H requires resource R currently accessed process process H would wait L using resource However suppose process M becomes runnable thereby preempting process Indirectly process lower affected long process H must wait L relinquish resource This problem known priority occurs system two priority one solution two operating system however
Typically system solve problem implementing protocol
According protocol process accessing resource needed process inherit higher priority resource priority revert original value
In example protocol would allow process L temporarily inherit priority process H thereby preventing process M preempting execution
When process L using resource R would relinquish inherited priority H assume original resource R would available process run next
Reference ABRAHAM SILBERSCHATZ Consider system two process high priority low priority
The scheduling rule run whenever ready state high priority
At certain moment critical region becomes ready run operation completes
begin busy waiting since never scheduled running never get chance leave critical section
So loop forever
This situation called
Because higher priority process waiting lower priority process
Let make simple clear
This answer based answer presented crisp way
Say resource process

priority
Say Now making problem clear actually wait complete happen problem

I problem understanding Snippet article Consider task L low priority
This task requires resource Consider L running acquires resource Now another task H high priority
This task also requires resource Consider H start L acquired resource Now H wait L relinquishes resource Everything work expected point problem arise new task M start medium priority time
Since R still use L H run
Since M highest priority unblocked task scheduled Since L preempted M L relinquish So M run till finished L run least point relinquish R H run
Thus scenario task medium priority ran task high priority effectively giving u priority inversion
The question relevant second part article
Why process H Higher priority process L lower priority process M medium priority

If H put block since R use M blocked well
Because M require resource R able run L still use H hand run L able release By posting answer agree

In problem encountered perpetually denied necessary process work
Starvation may caused error scheduling algorithm also caused intentionally caused via
The impossibility starvation concurrent algorithm called instance one two requirement mutual exclusion algorithm correctness
The name finite bypass mean process concurrent part algorithm bypassed finite number time allowed access
Starvation usually caused overly simplistic
For example poorly designed system always switch first two task third never get run third task starved
The scheduling algorithm part supposed allocate resource equitably algorithm allocate resource process perpetually lack necessary resource
Many operating system scheduler employ concept process priority
A high priority process A run low priority process B
If high priority process process A never block low priority process B system never experience starvation
If even higher priority process X dependent result process B process X might never finish even though important process system
This condition called
Modern scheduling algorithm normally contain code guarantee process receive minimum amount important resource often CPU time order prevent process subjected starvation
In computer network especially wireless network may suffer scheduling starvation
An example
Starvation similar cause process freeze
Two process become deadlocked nothing waiting resource occupied another program set
On hand process starvation waiting resource continuously given process
stronger guarantee absence deadlock mutual exclusion algorithm must choose let one two process pick one arbitrarily
A possible solution starvation use scheduling algorithm priority queue also us technique
Aging technique gradually increasing priority process wait system long time

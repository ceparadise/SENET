In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

Java us stack keep track sequence method call within program
This approach used trace recursive method hand
The technique actually work sequence method call though usually worthwhile recursive method
PDF Thank much
I reference website often
This first time I understood trace recursive method properly
I finally get

In involves specialized use record information program execution
This information typically used purpose additionally depending type detail information contained trace log experienced personnel software monitoring tool common problem software
Tracing
There always clear distinction form except term almost never applied logging program therefore excluding logging data external source experiment
Logs record program usage event primarily interest system administrator see example fall terminological gray area
This article deal primarily tracing debugging diagnostic purpose
Difficulties making clear distinction event logging software tracing arise fact technology used many criterion distinguish two continuous rather discrete
The following table list important mean precise universal distinction used developer select technology purpose guide separate development new technology area Event logging provides system administrator information useful diagnostics
The different class event logged well detail appear event message often considered early development cycle
Many event logging technology allow even require class event assigned unique code used event logging software separate viewer Event Viewer format output message
This facilitates localization allows system administrator easily obtain information problem occur
Because event logging used log information often failure information performance logging implementation often le important
A special concern preventing duplicate event recorded often taken care
Software tracing provides developer information useful debugging
This information used development cycle release software
Unlike event logging software tracing usually concept class event event code
Other reason solution based event code inappropriate software tracing include Another important consideration software tracing performance
Because software tracing possible volume trace message much higher
To address performance concern often must possible turn software tracing either
Other special concern Software tracing Event logging Appropriate

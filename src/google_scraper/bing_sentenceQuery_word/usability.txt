In contrast UE research design process ensures product good usability
Usability
As requirement usability directly measured must quantified mean indirect measure attribute example number reported problem system
The term often listed desirable trait usable interface often used synonym
Some expert discouraged using term user interface design claiming easy use interface often easy user exposure previous similar system thus term preferred
As example Two vertical line medium player button intuitively mean pause convention
Aiming intuitive interface based reusing existing skill interaction system could lead designer discard better design solution would require novel approach
This position sometimes illustrated remark The intuitive interface nipple everything else learned
even denies existence intuitive interface since interface must able intuit perceive pattern user behavior draw inference
Instead advocate term intuitable user could intuit working application seeing using
He continues however But even le useful goal since percent population depends intuition perceive anything

An experienced focus group facilitator hired guide discussion area interest developer
Focus group typically videotaped help get verbatim quote clip often used summarize opinion
The data gathered usually quantitative help get idea target group opinion
advantage inexpensive require testing equipment result reflect user opinion
When written carefully given actual user experience product knowledge design survey provide useful feedback strong weak area usability design
This common method often appear survey warranty card
It often difficult designer conduct usability test exact system designed
Cost constraint size design constraint usually lead designer creating prototype system
Instead creating complete final system designer may test different section system thus making several small model component system
The type usability prototype may vary using paper model index card hand drawn model storyboards
Prototypes able modified quickly often faster easier create le time invested designer apt change design although sometimes adequate representation whole system often durable testing result may parallel actual system
Rapid prototyping method used early stage development validate refine usability system
It used quickly cheaply evaluate design without need expensive working model
This help remove hesitation change design since implemented real programming begin
One method rapid prototyping
These usability evaluation method involve testing subject quantitative data
Usually recorded video provide task completion time allow observation attitude
Regardless carefully system designed theory must tested using usability test
Usability test involve typical user using system product realistic environment see
Observation user behavior emotion difficulty performing different task often identify area improvement system
While conducting usability test designer must use usability metric identify going measure usability metric
These metric often variable change conjunction scope goal project
The number subject tested also affect usability metric often easier focus specific demographic
Qualitative design phase general usability task accomplished
user satisfaction also typically done smaller group subject
Using inexpensive prototype small user group provides detailed information interactive atmosphere designer ability focus individual user
As design become complex testing must become formalized
Testing equipment become sophisticated testing metric become quantitative
With refined prototype designer often test effectiveness efficiency subjective satisfaction asking user complete various task
These category measured percent complete task long take complete task ratio success failure complete task time spent error number error rating scale satisfaction number time user seems frustrated etc
Additional observation user give designer insight navigation difficulty control conceptual model etc
The ultimate goal analyzing metric prototype design user like use successfully perform given task
After conducting usability test important designer record observed addition behavior occurred modify model according result
Often quite difficult distinguish source design error user wrong
However effective usability test generate solution problem provide modified design guideline continued testing
Remote usability testing also known unmoderated asynchronous usability testing involves use specially modified online survey allowing quantification user testing study providing ability generate large sample size deep qualitative analysis without need dedicated facility

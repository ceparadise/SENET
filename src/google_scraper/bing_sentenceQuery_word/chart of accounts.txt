Hi I question Who determined numbering system used company chart account
Thanks Hello I I drafted preparing financial report funders NGO
I get financial report Fiscal Agents every month expense detailed
Mostly seems logical report I get expense order account order date paid
But several category subcategories look like based number
For example Consultants Service Providers IT website nested expense
It look like error I know enough say
For example read Consultants Service Providers Media provider Total Media provider Web design hosting Web design Total Web design Total Web design hosting Web hosting Total Web hosting Total Consultants service provider Perhaps fine
It seems counterintuitive
It happens several place report I get Dear Ida Wright There many type MIS ERP Systems systematic procedure different
There reason behind problem
If create account system automatically assign system generated COA No
After deletion account system permanently delete number assign due conflict account No future
The reason many system work smarter
If transaction specific account specific time period someone generate report system pick account due non availability transaction make report shorter
Hope got answer

million business use QuickBooks A chart account lot like game Jenga
If take block away one section business add back someplace else
This accounting system created hope always balance total asset liability owe
While rarely case reality may know difference owe equity
The goal course owe equity look positive book provide later
Let start understanding chart account
There four main section asset liability income expense
Equity also section one actively manage
Equity left business activity plus minus properly recorded
Assets income good
Liabilities expense great bad
Many people think expense loan necessary evil idea incur liability expense serve good
In word think liability expense investment investment whose purpose pump asset income
Many accounting system come preset chart account whose line item include numbered header like
While may great accountant way Dewey Decimal System make sense librarian small business unnecessary cumbersome confusing
Just make sure line item title make sense accountant
Use straightforward title like Bank Fees Charges Bottling When setting line item first time keep simple
Over course time fall trap creating new line item every single thing
You create subaccounts tracking certain thing like PayPal Fees Bank Fees Postage Office But part keeping chart account simple keep business accounting simple error free
Your asset account include anything value like building land equipment vehicle valuable inventory
Unfortunately asset may look pretty chart account might real estate agent website
That accountant tracking actually paid property depreciation
If want show someone building equipment inventory really worth put sale using outside source report value change market
Other asset account include account receivable note receivable
After technically money
When someone owes money asset
It delivered yet
Liabilities include thing like bank loan mortgage personal loan promissory note income tax payment due payroll tax due course bill otherwise known account payable
One important thing beginning business owner keep mind note payable entry represent amount
Do include interest amount owed
When make monthly payment enter payment accounting system split payment amount subtracted owe amount interest paid go expense
For example Boardwalk bank loan Boardwalk interest total check
Income pretty also category underutilized many business owner
Most new owner start one two wide category like sale But type income easy cheap generate require effort time expense make sense create separate line item different type income
Instead lumping income one account consider various profitable activity may break type income
Don go wild crazy course able see exactly location activity bringing cash flow able wisely manage business
For instance store sell book gift food item want income line
Later able compare cost good profit level category know type good profitable
The true service business sell service also teach class outside consulting track different type income separately
It also good idea break expense separate account
Keep category simple possible creating subcategories truly see need
For instance ship lot product may want track cost different shipping carrier separately
Or cookbook author may want track food cost recipe testing different subcategories book
Remember business grows need accurate fast legible reporting
Your chart account map past present treasure map future
Keep clean organized make sure make sense important person involved

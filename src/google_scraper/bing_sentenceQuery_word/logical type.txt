cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

aspect computer design concerning fundamental operation structure upon computer system built
Numerical system based counting using alphabet operation
The decimal number system us alphabet called digit basic operation add subtract mulitply divide symbolised
The decimal number system enough digit count item
To avoid creating many digit quantity might encounter idea relative positional counting used
The digit example mean five fifty
Similarly digit except zero
Zero unique serf place holder digit correctly positioned
Thus number contain digit represent different quantity digit merely allows u correctly position
Digits arbitrarily defined digit could mean perhaps mean seven digit
While may seem crazy fact flexibility exactly enables computer scientist design language aware tool like spell checker rudimentary language translator
Since computer science utterly based Number System Theory meaning digit must expanded beyond mere counting quantity value
However passing digit device human done arbitrarily otherwise would make sense result
For reason basic conventional standard define digit mean specific situation
One standard American Standard Code International Interchange ASCII
This Standard table defines number zero represent
The English alphabet b c x z represented form well digit
Thus ASCII digit zero number one nine
Here overloaded digit mean value digit
This lead problem something like ASCII code number
Unfortunately answer depends context
The key understanding computer lie unlearning digit mean one one learning digit may number
Similarly digit
Indeed often borrow letter b c x z represent digit
The letter example may represent number ten eleven fifteen
However underneath meaning digit fixed unique numerical value obey Number Systems Theory
Number Systems differ total digit represent quantity
So four digit say could still represent number twenty
We arrive surprising result noting positional value changed
Here count value four must written
By moving one position left show four time value ten time
We read four Number system
So eight four four
Twelve three four
Fifteen twelve plus three
Since sixteen four four must move left another position giving u four Number system
Nineteen sixteen plus three
Finally twenty four four plus four
Lets pick another number system say one twenty digit
The quantity twenty system number One zero twenty Number System
We conclude four Number System equal twenty Number System
The astute reader
noticed number system represent nine value four digit three value twenty nineteen
In case maximum value one le number digit
This true number system
Further repositioning digit left right value change multiple number digit
For ten digit system change multiple ten four digit system change multiple four twenty digit system change position multiple twenty
A Number System defined many digit called
We therefore identify Number System base
The number read base four know base eight might look similar actually different value another Number System
continued Computer system regularly use numeral system base
Base binary Base octal Base hexadecimal numeral system used designing computer system simpler manner base
Binary number core computer operation
Unlike decimal number ten digit binary number made two digit
It easy represent binary value electrical circuit computer system
A high voltage used low voltage
A single value called
Hexadecimal often used represent binary data
The hexadecimal numeral system special property every digit represents exactly four bit used compact representation large value
For example binary equivalent hexadecimal number decimal decimal
To convert base another use base portal base divide result base binary get modular end since left number le right number take number put mod result beside last result first result oct binary Just rule exist arithmetic operation decimal number number technique evaluating various operation base
Several system designed represent negative number binary
The commonly used called
This system popular number using representation easy negate arithmetic operation performed positive negative number manner
In two complement binary value whose significant bit MSB positive whereas whose MSB negative
To negate two complement binary number invert bit add one
For example decimal becomes decimal
There two common method calculating two complement binary number
The first first use one complement simple inversion bit becomes becomes
So given binary representation decimal converted one complement
To obtain two complement one complement add
This yield decimal
The mechanic addition become clearer progress
The method shortcut using one complement adding one take advantage fact adding force carry bit addition save work ahead time beginning least significant bit LSB keep least significant example invert bit significant least significant finally end result decimal
To perform addition number system begin LSB
Combine two LSB exceed base must carry one next position
Any difference total combination computed base left position
Here example decimal And
In binary slightly easier notice already reached base zero current position carry next position
It feel like flipping bit
When multiplication binary number following truth table used
The truth table addition also needed
Example multiplication The common binary code BCD Gray Code
Each purpose
BCD stand decimal
Using binary string decimal digit encoded binary
The limit course largest decimal value binary string capacity
code BCD adding subt
Gray Code core concept reducing number bitwise change increment counting order
This requires le power system seem like arbitrary sequence first glance
Any arithmetic operation computer system implemented using basic logical operation AND OR
In fact proven entire computer system designed implemented using solely NAND operation

The field area active research demonstrated
In system type theory operation restricted term certain type
A describes term type
For example may type representing natural number may inhabitant type
The judgement type written
A function type theory denoted arrow
The function commonly called judgement
Calling function argument may written without parenthesis
The notation without parenthesis may serve expressive notation consistent
Type theory also contain rule rewriting term
These called rule work one direction
For example syntactically different term former reduces latter
This reduction denoted
There many different set theory many different system type theory follows generalization
The term reduces
Since reduced called
A system type theory said term normal form order reduction reach
system normal form order reduction may loop forever never reach
For normalizing system borrow word set theory use refer closed term reduce normal form
A one without parameter
A term like parameter called
Thus may different term form element
A similar idea work open closed term convertibility
Two term exists term reduce
For example convertible
As
However free variable normal form
weakly normalizing system test two term convertible checking reduce normal form
A type depends term another type
Thus type returned function may depend upon argument function
For example list length may different type list length
In type theory dependent type possible define function take parameter n return list containing n zero
Calling function would produce term different type function called
Dependent type play central role design like
Many system type theory type represents equality type term
This type different convertibility often denoted
In intuitionistic type theory equality type also identity type known identity
There type type term type
A term type interpreted meaning equal
In practice possible build type exist term type
In intuitionistic type theory new term equality start reflexivity
If term type exists term type
More complicated equality created creating reflexive term reduction one side
So term type term type reduction generate term type
Thus system equality type denotes two value type convertible reduction
Having type equality important manipulated inside system
There usually judgement say two term equal instead map value
There exists term type one type
differs mostly handling equality type
A system type theory requires basic term type operate
Some system build function using
Other system set base type set generate type property
For example called inductive type guaranteed terminate
infinite data type created giving function generates next element
See
feature declaring inductive type family type depends inductive type
allows wider range type allowing type recursive function operating defined time
Types created prevent paradox
However motif lead able say thing exist
So many type theory universe type contains type
In system might want say something universe type hierarchy universe type containing one hierarchy
The hierarchy defined infinite statement must refer finite number universe level
Type universe particularly tricky type theory
The initial proposal intuitionistic type theory suffered

Researchers exploring connection dependent type especially identity type specifically
Much current research type theory driven interactive
Most system use type theory mathematical foundation encoding proof surprising given close connection type theory programming language Multiple type theory supported
Isabelle also support foundation besides type theory
example proof system support set theory
Type theory also widely use especially descendant
In particular make extensive use type constructor define type etc

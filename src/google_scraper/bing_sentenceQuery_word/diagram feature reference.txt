In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

method running application software storing related data central computer system providing customer user access
The origin expression obscure appears derive practice using drawing stylized cloud denote network diagram computing communication system
The term came popular use though practice providing remote access computing function network date back system
In book Canadian electrical engineer Douglas Parkhill predicted computer industry would come resemble many remotely located user connected via communication link central computing For decade effort create computer utility frustrated constraint capacity telephone system
It cheaper easier company organization store data run application private computing system maintained within facility
The constraint network capacity began removed telecommunication company invested network response rapidly growing use Internet shared network exchanging information
In late number company called application service provider ASPs founded supply computer application company Internet
Most early ASPs failed model supplying application remotely became popular decade later renamed cloud computing
Cloud computing number different service
One set service sometimes called SaaS involves supply discrete application outside user
The application geared either business user accounting application consumer application storing sharing personal photograph
Another set service variously called utility computing grid computing hardware service HaaS involves provision computer processing data storage outside user able run application store data remote system
A third set service sometimes called platform service PaaS involves supply remote computing capacity along set tool use outside software programmer
Early pioneer cloud computing include supply popular business application managing sale marketing effort addition supply array application known consumer business Amazon Web Services division online retailer offer access computing system developer company individual
Cloud computing also underpins popular online medium site
Traditional software company including also introduced cloud application
company either charge user service subscription usage fee provide free access service charge company placing advertisement service
Because profitability cloud service tends much lower profitability selling licensing hardware component software program viewed potential threat business many traditional computing company
Construction large data centre run service often requires investment hundred million dollar
The centre typically contain thousand computer networked together system
The centre also often employ sophisticated virtualization technology allow computer system divided many virtual machine rented temporarily customer
Because intensive use electricity centre often located near hydroelectric dam source cheap plentiful
Because cloud computing involves storage often sensitive personal commercial information central system run third party raise concern data privacy security well transmission data across national boundary
It also stir fear eventual creation data monopoly oligopoly
Some believe cloud computing like public utility come heavily regulated government
increasingly adopted source information service
It offer access via Internet service furnished provider run data centre necessary software resource
The service provided one Internet often called cloud computing
introduced iCloud cloud computing service user application photograph document calendar recently purchased music would stored iCloud automatically updated user device

With SmartDraw You Can Create More Different Types Diagrams Charts Visuals
UML way visualizing software program using collection diagram
The notation evolved work Grady Booch James Rumbaugh Ivar Jacobson Rational Software Corporation used design since extended cover wider variety software engineering project
Today UML accepted Object Management Group OMG standard modeling software development
UML stand Unified Modeling Language
UML helped extend original UML specification cover wider portion software development effort including agile practice
The key making UML diagram connecting shape represent object class shape illustrate relationship flow information data
To learn creating UML diagram The current UML standard call different type diagram class activity object use case sequence package state component communication composite structure interaction overview timing deployment
These diagram organized two distinct group structural diagram behavioral interaction diagram
Structural UML diagram Behavioral UML diagram backbone almost every method including UML
They describe static structure system
Package diagram subset class diagram developer sometimes treat separate technique
Package diagram organize element system related group minimize dependency package
Object diagram describe static structure system particular time
They used test class diagram accuracy
Composite structure diagram show internal part class
model functionality system using actor use case
illustrate dynamic nature system modeling flow control activity activity
An activity represents operation class system result change state system
Typically activity diagram used model workflow business process internal operation
describe interaction among class term exchange message time
Interaction overview diagram combination activity sequence diagram
They model sequence action let deconstruct complex interaction manageable occurrence
You use notation interaction overview diagram would see activity diagram
A timing diagram type behavioral interaction UML diagram focus process take place specific period time
They special instance sequence diagram except time shown increase left right instead top
Communication diagram model interaction object sequence
They describe static structure dynamic behavior system
In many way communication diagram simplified version collaboration diagram introduced UML known state machine diagram state diagram describe dynamic behavior system response external stimulus
State diagram especially useful modeling reactive object whose state triggered specific event
describe organization physical software component including source code binary code executables

Deployment diagram depict physical resource system including node component connection
There many different type UML diagram slightly different symbol set
Class diagram perhaps one common UML diagram used class diagram symbol center around defining attribute class
For example symbol active class interface
A class symbol also divided show class operation attribute responsibility
Visibility class member marked notation Lines also important symbol denote relationship component
Generalization Inheritance denoted empty arrowhead
Composition shown filled diamond
Aggregation shown empty diamond
Dependencies marked dashed line arrow
Using allows indicate property dependency
Multiplicity usually shown number one end arrow
Package diagram symbol defining package look like folder
Activity diagram symbol activity state including separate symbol initial state final state
The control flow usually shown arrow object flow shown dashed arrow
Use case diagram symbol actor use case
A complex enterprise application many collaborator require solid foundation planning clear concise communication among team member project progress

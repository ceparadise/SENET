In shared boundary across two separate component exchange information
The exchange device combination
Some computer hardware device send receive data interface others mouse microphone may provide interface send data given system
Hardware interface exist many component various device etc
A hardware interface described mechanical electrical logical signal interface protocol sequencing sometimes called signaling
A standard interface decouples design introduction computing hardware device design introduction component computing system thereby allowing user manufacturer great flexibility implementation computing system
Hardware interface several electrical connection carrying part data simultaneously data sent one time
A software interface may refer wide range different type interface different level operating system may interface piece hardware
running operating system may need interact via object within application may need interact via
A key principle design prohibit access resource default allowing access entry point
interface
Software interface provide access computer resource memory CPU storage etc
underlying computer system direct access
well designed interface resource software major disastrous functionality stability
Interfaces software component provide type specification
Sometimes public also defined part interface
The interface software module deliberately defined separately module
The latter contains actual code procedure method described interface well private variable procedure etc
Another software module example interacts forced published interface
One practical advantage arrangement replacing implementation another implementation interface cause internally meet requirement interface relevant specification interface

In language term often used define contains data code defines behavior signature
A code data method corresponding interface said interface
Furthermore class implement multiple interface hence different type time
An interface thus definition anywhere object exchanged example call object exchanged defined term interface rather specifying particular
This approach mean class implement interface used
For example may used allow development progress final implementation available
In another case implementation may substituted testing
Such implementation replaced real code later development process
Usually method defined interface contains code thus called must implemented code run invoked
An interface called might define two method
It implemented different way example first fast working stack fixed size second using data structure resized cost somewhat lower speed
Though interface contain many method may contain one even none
For example language defines interface single method various implementation used different purpose including
like contain method serve provide information generic processing using
The use interface allows programming style called
The idea behind approach base programming logic interface object used rather internal implementation detail
Programming interface reduces dependency implementation specific make code reusable
Pushing idea extreme leaf inject code specific implementation interface used perform work
A point interaction computer human includes number graphic sound position movement etc
data transferred user computer system

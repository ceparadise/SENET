MITRE Systems Engineers SEs working government program propose influence often design risk management approach
They prepare monitor risk mitigation plan strategy government project program office review risk management plan prepared government contractor
As management process risk management used identify avoid potential cost schedule risk system take proactive structured approach manage negative outcome respond occur identify potential opportunity may hidden situation
The risk management approach plan operationalize management goal
Because two project exactly alike risk management approach plan tailored scope complexity individual project
Other consideration include role responsibility size project team risk management process required recommended government organization risk management tool available project
Risk occurs across spectrum government various enterprise individual system
At system level risk focus typically center development
Risk exists operation requirement design development integration testing training fielding etc
see section Guide
For dependency risk rise top
Working consistency across synchronizing capability development fielding considering whether interface interoperate integrate risk associated path come forefront environment
At enterprise level governance complexity risk become prominent
Governance risk different guidance across enterprise benefit enterprise trickle individual system resulting potentially unanticipated demand perhaps suboptimal solution low level may beneficial enterprise level
Dealing unknown increase risk associated Guide section loose coupling federated architecture portfolio help MITRE SE alleviate risk
risk management predominantly responsibility team working provide capability particular development effort
Within risk area primary responsibility fall system program manager SE working risk management developer integrator helping identify create approach reduce risk
In addition key responsibility user community decision maker onwhen accept residual risk consequence identified
The article topic area provide guidance identifying risk mitigating risk system level option like control transfer watch program risk assessment scale matrix
These guideline together MITRE SEs using tool identified article help program team deal risk management provide realism development implementation capability user
Today body literature engineering risk management largely aimed addressing traditional engineering system system designed engineered set user requirement specification technical standard
In contrast little exists risk management principle apply system whose functionality performance governed interaction set highly interconnected yet independent cooperating system
Such system may referred
A thought set arrangement system related interconnected provide given capability otherwise would possible
The loss part supporting system degrades case eliminates performance capability whole
What make risk management engineering challenging managing risk traditional system engineering project
The basic risk management process step
The challenge come implementing managing process step across complex whose subordinate system manager stakeholder may geographically dispersed organizationally distributed may fully intersecting user need
How delivery capability time affect risk managed
The difficulty aligning mapping identified risk capability planned delivered within specified build specified time
Here critically important risk impact assessment made function capability affected effect occur impact user stakeholder
Lack clearly defined system boundary management line responsibility accountability challenge management risk engineering
User stakeholder acceptance risk management participation process essential success
Given program need establish environment reporting risk potential consequence encouraged rewarded
Without incomplete picture risk
Risks threaten successful engineering may become evident late effectively manage mitigate
Frequently planned engineered deliver capability series evolutionary build
Risks originate different source threaten different time evolution
These risk source mapped capability potentially affect according planned delivery date
Assessments made risk potential impact planned capability whether collateral effect dependent capability technology
In case overall risk linear subordinate risk
Rather combination specific lower level individual system risk put together potential adversely impact way equate simple risk
The result risk important individual system managed level others warrant attention engineering management
Risk management enterprise system pose even greater challenge risk management program
Enterprise environment Internet offer user ubiquitous access wide variety service application information repository
Enterprise system engineering emerging discipline
It encompasses extends traditional system engineering create evolve web system operate way deliver capability via service data application interconnected network information communication technology
This environment system engineering
In enterprise risk management viewed integration people process tool together ensure early continuous identification resolution enterprise risk
The goal provide decision maker understanding risk potential consequence interdependency rippling effect within beyond enterprise boundary
Ultimately risk management aim establish maintain holistic view risk across enterprise capability performance objective achieved via resource investment decision
Today early stage understanding system engineering engineering management social science method weave together create system live evolve enterprise environment
The Risk Management Plan describes process fundamental step shown Figure intended enable engineering system accomplished within cost delivered time meet user need
In supporting Department Defense DoD civilian agency project program MITRE SEs found following minimum condition needed initiate continuously execute risk management successfully
With program increase chance identifying risk early goal objective achieved
It important MITRE SEs well project program leader keep minimum condition mind taking action appropriate role

Therefore follows recognizing potential problem project manager core team member avoid problem proper action

Scope change control A scope change occurs significant modification project plan
Typically change impact cost schedule deliverable
Significant scope change scope creep numerous small change major cause project failure
Allowing project scope change usually mean added cost greater risk longer duration
Many project fail due poor scope management
Very often large number small scope change damage rather big obvious one
The successful Project Manager learned rigorous scope control essential deliver project time budget
By making rigorous scope change control plan impact change scope project reduced minimum

Introduction One important asset organization posse data
Although data varies among organization economic research hospital important data may data collected latest clinical trial magazine list current lifeblood organization
Without data organization could function
Data risk management audit computer network access vulnerability discovered taking step manage loss
Risk Management Steps Many organization address risk associated data owns feel need safeguard importance undervalued
An organization information valuable possession personnel finance property
There step take assessing risk computer network
The step involved focus identification asset threat vulnerability appraisal risk assessment mitigation risk
Risk management process determine potential loss relates threat factor equipment failure physical catastrophe criminal attack
As example limited risk management assessment study performed personal computer PC writer begin determination asset involved
Asset Identification The asset large enterprise organization comprise factor building personnel software hardware course data
On small scale end user asset would consist PC hardware used software operating system OS network accessed data I create
Without colorful entertaining essay would come light
My hardware asset identified item including manufacturer model type serial number location computer address Internet Protocol IP Media Access Control MAC distinctive information known identify hardware
Shown table example hardware asset assessment
Table
Hardware asset identification Manufacturer Model Type Serial Location MAC Apple MacBook Pro Portable Home Threat Identification The next step would identify threat various threat agent
These agent consist factor including limited theft OS failure vandalism compromised system sabotage human error natural disaster
These agent among handful factor identified
Shown table example theft agent identified
Table
Threat identification Threat Agents Theft OS Failure Compromised System Dropped Portable Computer Software Attacks Hardware Failure Vulnerability Appraisal Step three would entail vulnerability appraisal determine security threat weakness may show
This result glimpse state security organization
Each asset examined incorrect configuration improper hardware setting lack wireless security Protected Access
I believe I previous time addressed vulnerability past computer well protected
I go detail later Risk Mitigation
Risk Assessment Step four would comprise risk assessment involving determination damage possible attack risk organization vulnerability
Determining risk requires genuine assessment different type vulnerability attack may arise
These risk ranked ranged minor catastrophic event
Shown table example risk assessment
Table
Risk Assessment No Impact Small Impact Significant Major Catastrophic Misplaced Mouse Charge Cord Malfunctioning Misconfigured Software Virus Cyber Attack Cyber Enslaved Stolen Lost Misplaced Inoperative Dropped Fire Damaged Risk Mitigation Finally identification appraisal assessment complete determination need made done
Accept risk take step minimize risk
Fortunately I use protected encryption wireless access point AP
I also personal firewall configured protect system attacker preventing unauthorized application program service accepting incoming connection without knowledge
I even enabled Stealth Mode directs computer respond acknowledge attempt access computer
This effectively ignore application able ping scan computer
Physically I keep portable computer hidden I leave house
When travelling I weary leaving computer bag unattended I ensure I time
I also feature installed portable called Find My Mac computer tracked via global positioning system GPS
If stolen I would option remotely locking computer also remotely wiping hard drive even user logged
Conclusion I reveal major vulnerability conclusion limited personal computer risk management study
Risk management process minimizing mitigating risk
It start identification evaluation risk followed optimal use resource monitor minimize
The feeling risk organization experience insecurity vulnerability identifies
By taking step identify vulnerability ass risk create plan mitigate risk organization protect loss

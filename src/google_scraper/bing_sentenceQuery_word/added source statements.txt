In syntactic unit express action carried
A program written language formed sequence one statement
A statement may internal component
Many imperative language
make distinction statement definition statement containing executable code definition instantiating expression evaluates value
A distinction also made simple compound statement latter may contain statement component
The following major generic kind statement pseudocoded
These pseudocoded statement immediate corresponding syntax typical imperative language like Pascal C Fortran etc
The appearance statement shape look program
Programming language characterized type statement use
family
Many statement introduced like
Often statement reserved used name
Imperative language typically use special syntax statement look quite different function call
Common method describe syntax statement
Semantically many statement differ call handling
Usually actual subroutine parameter evaluated subroutine called
This contrast many statement parameter evaluated several time
condition
loop body loop
Technically statement parameter parameter
parameter evaluated needed see also
When parameter available statement like behaviour implemented subroutine see
For language without parameter semantic description usually beyond capability language
Therefore standard document often refer semantic description natural language
In language statement contrast statement return result executed solely expression always return result often side effect
Among imperative programming language one statement return result
In language mix imperative style family distinction expression statement made even expression executed sequential context solely side effect whose return value used considered
In statement everything expression
This distinction frequently observed wording statement expression
This found function found language Python found applied statement applied expression
Most language fixed set statement defined language experiment allow programmer define new statement

learn share knowledge build career
What statement
Algorithm determines number statement number operation executed Computer Organization Design A line code something

I developed appreciation big picture conversely important detail
I also discovered leadership skill frequently assisted colleague little background computer
As outcome company asked take occasional seminar Operating Systems colleague
I appointed Team Leader within year today I independently look enhancement maintenance three module sixteen Project ART
During work project ART MBT interaction colleague I grown admire role Computer Networks empowering
I directly involved Computer Networks job avid reading periodical journal like World I sustained interest field
In fact reading immense potential protocol application like Over Private Networks I help feel excited potential new research area
While present job helped develop thorough insight project handling industry environment I currently support desire research
I posse skill Computers I must build achieve goal undertaking research advanced computing specific reference Computer Networks
I therefore believe I must return academic world growth
I wish earn MS degree Computer Science
I intend follow later career research teaching

In explanation
They added purpose making source code easier human understand generally ignored
The various programming language varies considerably
Comments sometimes processed various way generate documentation external source code used integration system kind external
The flexibility provided comment allows wide degree variability formal convention use commonly part guide
Comments generally formatted either also called also called
Block comment region source code may span multiple line
This region specified delimiter delimiter
Some programming language allow block comment recursively nested inside one another others
Line comment either start comment delimiter continue end line case start specific column character line offset source code continue end line
Some programming language employ block line comment different comment delimiters
For example block comment delimited span multiple line line comment delimited
Other language support one type comment
For example comment line comment start continue end line
How best make use comment subject dispute different commentator offered varied sometimes opposing viewpoint
There many different way writing comment many commentator offer sometimes conflicting advice
Comments used form outline intention prior writing actual code
In case explain logic behind code rather code
If type comment left simplifies review process allowing direct comparison code intended result
A common logical fallacy code easy understand
Comments used summarize code explain programmer intent
According school thought restating code plain English considered superfluous need code may sign complex rewritten naming bad
Comments may also used explain block code seem fit convention best practice
This especially true project involving little development time bug fixing
For example Sometimes source code contains novel noteworthy solution specific problem
In case comment may contain explanation methodology
Such explanation may include diagram formal mathematical proof
This may constitute explanation code rather clarification intent others tasked maintaining code base may find explanation crucial
This might especially true case highly specialized problem domain rarely used optimization construct
For example programmer may add comment explain chosen instead former theory slower latter
This could written follows diagram consisting construction inserted source code formatted comment
Further notice embedded within source code comment
Binary data may also encoded comment process known although practice uncommon typically relegated external resource file
The following code fragment simple ASCII diagram depicting process flow script contained running
Although section marking code appears comment diagram actually appears section technically considered distinct comment serve similar purpose
Although identical diagram could easily included comment example illustrates one instance programmer may opt use comment way including resource source code
Comments computer program often store metadata program file
In particular many put submission guideline comment help people read source code program send improvement make back maintainer
Other metadata includes name creator original version program file date first version created name current maintainer program name people edited program file far URL documentation use program name program file etc
When algorithm section program based description book reference comment used give page number title book reference
A common developer practice meaning add comment syntax causing block code become comment executed final program
This may done exclude certain piece code final program commonly used find source error
By systematically commenting running part program source error determined allowing corrected
An example commenting code exclusion purpose The code fragment suggests programmer opted disable debugging option reason
Many allow quick adding removing comment single menu option key combination
The programmer mark part text want un comment choose appropriate option
sometimes store documentation comment
These may include insert position automatic header file inclusion command set file mode file
These functional control comment also commonly referred
Keeping documentation within source code comment considered one way simplify documentation process well increase chance documentation kept date change code
Examples documentation generator include program use Java
Forms supported
implement similar feature called XML Comments read compiled assembly
Occasionally syntax element originally intended comment convey additional information program
Such hot comment may practical solution maintains widely regarded
Sometimes comment source code used way relieve stress commenting development tool competitor employer working condition quality code
The occurrence phenomenon easily seen online resource track source code
There various normative view opinion regarding proper use comment source code
Some informal based personal preference others published promulgated formal guideline
Experts varying viewpoint whether comment appropriate source code
Some assert source code written comment basis source code
Others suggest code extensively commented uncommon character source code contained within comment
In view assertion comment neither beneficial harmful matter correct kept sync source code omitted superfluous excessive difficult maintain otherwise unhelpful
Comments sometimes used document contract approach programming
Depending intended audience code consideration level detail description may vary considerably
For example following Java comment would suitable introductory text designed teach beginning programming This level detail however would appropriate context production code situation involving experienced developer
Such rudimentary description inconsistent guideline Good comment clarify intent
Further professional coding environment level detail ordinarily meet specific performance requirement defined business operation
There many stylistic alternative available considering comment appear source code
For larger project involving team developer comment style either agreed upon project start evolve matter convention need project grows
Usually programmer prefer style consistent easy modify difficult break
The following code fragment C demonstrate tiny example comment vary stylistically still conveying basic information Factors personal preference flexibility programming tool consideration tend influence stylistic variant used source code
For example Variation Two might disfavored among programmer automate alignment visual appearance text comment
Software consultant technology commentator Allen Holub one expert advocate aligning left edge comment The use block comment delimiters inherited B programming language immediate predecessor C programming language
In form text ASCII character end line ignored
Different style chosen different area code individual line paragraph routine file program
If syntax support line comment block comment one method use line comment minor comment declaration block edits use block comment describe abstraction function class file module
Sometimes project try enforce rule like one comment every ten line
These kind rule counterproductive rigorous may provide useful standard measurement consistency project participant deem necessary
Inline comment using character part language
However Dennis Ritchie BCPL B language chose use block comment instead
This choice continued C language Ritchie successor Inline comment using reappeared successor C influenced adoption
Programmers may use informal comment assist indexing common issue
They may able searched common programming tool utility even within
These sometimes referred codetags token
Such tag differ widely might include Typographic convention specify comment vary widely
Further individual programming language sometimes provide unique variant
For detailed review please consult article
The programming language us indicate comment end line
For example This section code show two style comment used language
This code fragment completely functioning program REM keyword used add comment describe program
Any text line apostrophe character also treated comment BASICs including descendant
An example Visual Basic This code fragment demonstrates use prologue comment block comment describe purpose
The comment explains key term concept includes short signature programmer authored code
Since also possible use syntax indicating comment
The may used mark comment Cisco router configuration mode
Such comment however saved contains displayed show run command
By contrast following command insert content actually part configuration may saved The description command used add description configuration interface neighbor name parameter may used add remark static route
Access list may also contain remark
us comment similar instead two dash us three
These comment caught ColdFusion engine printed browser
This code fragment demonstrates comment used language
A letter C column cause entire line treated comment
Note column line otherwise treated four field label field cause line taken continuation previous statement declaration statement go
This code fragment demonstrates comment used language comment describing basic formatting rule
Line comment Haskell start two hyphen end line multiple line comment start end
Haskell also provides method commenting known
In line starting interpreted code everything else considered comment
One additional requirement always leave blank line code block Literate programming also done Haskell using
The code environment used instead Richard Bird style In style equivalent example code environment could defined LaTeX preamble
Here simple definition later This code fragment show block comment used describe method
The formatting consistent standard
The comment designed read Javadoc processor
us precede comment comment
The programming language us single line comment similar way language
Lua also block comment start run closing For example A common technique comment piece code enclose code In case possible reactivate code adding single hyphen first line In first example first line start long comment two hyphen last line still inside comment
In second example sequence start ordinary comment first last line become independent comment
In case outside comment
In case last line becomes independent comment start
Long comment Lua complex read section called Long string

In programming language character indicates comment
Multi line comment also available via bracket nested
us nestable comment useful commenting code block
In Niklaus Wirth family language including comment opened completed
example In modern dialect Pascal used instead
Line comment many begin hash symbol
Instead regular block commenting construct Perl us markup language instance Perl us line comment POD Documentation comment regular see Perl section add configurable block comment type embedded comment
These start hash character followed backtick opening bracketing character end matching closing bracketing character
The content span multiple line also embedded inline
Comments either style inline block use hash
style adapted Javadoc common standard documenting PHP code
Comments Comments use hash character two example code Specific block comment exist Python bare represented string could used
In example triple string act way comment also treated Comments
Single line commenting line start hash commenting comment go keywords begin end Comments SQL form using two dash The syntax also support alternative format specifying comment
One format supported syntax identical block comment style used syntax Java
comment begin two Multiline comment start followed asterisk end asterisk followed Multiline comment Swift nested inside multiline comment
You write nested comment starting multiline comment block starting second multiline comment within first block
The second block closed followed first block Comments HTML introduced spread several line terminator For example In comment viewable end user program
In case section code commented may present security

system protein interaction analysis basic research drug discovery development nucleic acid isolation system BAS LAS FLA imaging system instrument system imaging analysis digital camera unique spectrophotometer based upon patented sample retention technology allowing small sample volume kit reagent molecular biology research including genomics proteomics PCR related product Science Life science move ahead rapidly past couple decade
In fact life science advance fast telling milestone another incremental achievement take thinking
Fortunately Donald Kennedy provides two guideline
He say One feature milestone development really new technology let scientist thing never could advance
Such advance include fluorescent microscopy high throughput genomic sequencing
The second feature worth pointing milestone say Kennedy discovery brings play whole assembly new technology something would much like
For example would surely milestone life science combine genomics drug discovery approach fight human disease aging aging see accompanying Updates Aging
In past five year though selecting key milestone life science seemed easy enough expert interviewed
They pointed sequencing human genome
Many also added sequencing model organism equally important
Other milestone emerged well
For example Kennedy indicates value small interfering RNAs
He say They provide capacity knock rather knock gene function let u explore way RNAs may influence control transcription
The expert interviewed also mentioned value automation microarrays microfluidics technological advance drive life science
The advance however go beyond science
Improvements also push ahead behavioral science ecology
For example combination electronic tag satellite recently helped team scientist Hopkins Marine Station track Atlantic bluefin tuna
Other behavioral scientist use robot tease detail behind display aggression communication
As expert interviewed reveal life science quickly move level never imagined
Read hear exciting recent advance possible advance lie ahead
Some major milestone recent year life science come processing sample smaller size done example microarrays
Steve Lombardi senior vice president product marketing development rank microarrays among top five milestone past five year
He say The world life science used think genome list gene
Microarrays enable whole genome science showing u molecular biology genome
The device made laboratory purchased ready use company Affymetrix
Companies specializing fabrication microarrays include
These device also provide new way study disease
Lombardi explains high density array let scientist look sequence variation see gene get turned disease understand transcription factor bind DNA turn gene first place
He add The amount information put one Affymetrix million one chip one platform
Moreover approach unbiased
That scientist let experiment reveal genome work
Microarrays also aimed specifically signal transduction research especially product
Li Shen president SuperArray say The microarray revolutionary concept
It change get information cell
For example SuperArray GEArrays used validate confirm hypothesis especially one related disease
Shen say We quite good coverage different application
We array pathway disease including cancer immunology neuroscience toxicology stem cell developmental biology
In addition making microarrays many application SuperArray also aim make technology simpler use
She say Another technical focus u making microarrays reliable easy use
We want microarrays used every lab routine tool like polymerase chain reaction PCR used today
Microfluidics handle small volume fluid including picoliter volume DNA analysis separation human blood cell application
This field includes technology come several company including
According Kevin Hrusovsky president chief executive officer Caliper technology might milestone past five year next five
He add many percent big pharmaceutical company use technology
For example Caliper LabChip drug discovery system miniaturizes integrates automates enzymatic cell based assay
Hrusovsky say instrument used Johnson Johnson Merck Pfizer big pharmaceutical company need higher quality screening profiling data
He say The LabChip robust much le expensive return year
Advances drug discovery also come new approach protein identification quantification
For example disposable Prespotted matrix assisted laser flight help researcher find new lead compound biomarkers
According Detlev Suckau head application development instrument proteomics Bruker This chip provides increase sensitivity
It consists plastic Bruker prespotted MALDI matrix calibrant spot
Suckau say Eppendorf technical expertise produce injection molded plastic chip required quality product
So excellent choice work
When scientist first learned gene surely thought finding way block
A variety genetically engineered line mouse altered tissue culture cell molecule like short interfering si knock gene
Among expert asked probably many life scientist RNA interference RNAi rank important milestone
To cause RNAi scientist put double stranded RNA cell
The double stranded RNA match complementary mRNA destroys stop making protein
So far scientist know RNAi take place cell many organism including mammal apparently participates antiviral defense regulation gene expression
A number RNAi kit
David Brown research development senior scientist head siRNA project group Ambion belief RNAi filled research void
He say Genome project verified blueprint key understand interact function
RNAi provides opportunity link gene identity gene function
You eliminate expression see happens
This technique used basic applied research
For example RNAi used fight disease
A researcher knock individual gene see affect phenotype different cell
For instance say Brown Cancer researcher look siRNAs affect proliferation apoptosis angiogenesis telomerase activity
In addition technique applied high throughput assay
Brown say We delivery technique cell line primary cell provide highly reproducible knock every well plate
In many experiment scientist would prefer focus primary cell
According Pat Dillon president chief executive officer People always known importance primary cell
Still researcher often used immortalized cell instead mostly convenience
But immortalized cell normal say Dillon
Some lot farther normal physiology would like study
For example immortalized cell line grow differently cancer cell body
To give researcher access primary cell ArtisOptimus grows primary mouse embryo fibroblast MEFs normal knockout mouse model retain initial growth genetic property
The company offer knockout MEFs several area related cancer research cell cycle apoptosis signaling study
Moreover providing primary cell known gene knockout open new approach studying disease
For instance Dillon say Certain MEFs used study growth applied cancer biology
In addition primary cell used drug development
As Dillon say We generated knockout MEFs include gene involved drug transport
With researcher look drug metabolic effect
In world biotechnology pharmaceutical company researcher remain alert improved throughput drug screening
Although process keep picking speed Jeff Mooney commercial technology director Life Sciences Division say You run target quickly still bottleneck false positive negative inability screen intractable orphan target
To enhance accuracy screening Corning developed Epic platform
Mooney say We surveyed bottleneck identifying viable target validating lead designed Epic system solve problem
That produced high throughput system detects biomolecular interaction
For instance platform identifies interaction protein protein small molecule plate
After releasing product Mooney started receiving positive feedback customer
He say We people telling u assay took six month develop conventional screening system done week system
In addition Mooney say We currently working customer assay intractable target well assay validate reduction false positive negative hit
Better lead generation reduce cost hopefully enable better drug
Some today experimental research take place silico
That interaction biologic process system behavior modeled computer
Mikhail Gishizky chief scientific officer say Use computer biosimulation infancy life science
He add Computer simulation play greater role understanding qualitative quantitative difference biologic process instance mouse man help scientist make better decision
At Entelos scientist build quantitative model predict human biological behavior
Specifically company PhysioLab technology enables development model dynamic biological behavior
In fact modeling system used many project pharmaceutical company including finding druggable target designing clinical trial
The greatest advance recent past required combination technology
Even integration might lie ahead especially field like system biology
Kennedy say hard predict new technology possible even near future
As example though say Applications lab automation going outstrip capacity even envision might
Although worked neurobiology many year add When I walk neurophysiology lab today I see people using computer manage experiment way I would dreamed possible
Perhaps dream thing lead milestone

I new agile Scrum I got confused difference Sprint Milestone Release
I heard say Sprint Milestone
Also software term Sprint Milestone look
But really
Some others say Milestone Sprint Release
So Milestone Release
In scrum guide word regarding Milestone
Why
Why always hear word milestone agile conversation milestone another term release
I looking clarification term Sprint Milestone Release one example
I would like know exact Scrum definition behind term
In Scrum Framework activity needed implementation entry Scrum Product Backlog performed within Sprints also called
Sprints always short normally week
Each Sprint follows defined process shown The heart Scrum Sprint two week one month potentially releasable product increment created
A new Sprint start immediately conclusion previous Sprint
Sprints consist Sprint planning daily scrum development work Sprint review Sprint retrospective
In Sprint planning work performed Sprint planned collaboratively Scrum Team
The Daily Scrum Meeting event Scrum Team synchronize activity create plan day
A Sprint Review held end Sprint inspect Increment make change Product Backlog needed
The Sprint Retrospective occurs Sprint Review prior next Sprint Planning
In meeting Scrum Team inspect create plan improvement enacted subsequent Sprint
The goal initial release planning estimate roughly feature delivered release deadline presuming deadline fixed choose rough delivery date given set feature scope fixed
We use information decide whether project produce enough ROI least pay therefore whether proceed
Milestone typically associated reaching certain goal proceeding forward stopping altogether
Checkpoint signifies point team stop check progress expectation possibly adjust
Milestone big granularity mean progress checking iterative way important overall project progress associated goal fulfilled important analysis decision needed associated phase iteration important point could related formal progress tracking
As team island unto hermetically sealed universe software development effort one team usually part bigger coordinated undertaking organization
Sprint Milestone release point project development meet
It may possible end particular milestone result release
Sprints chunk development plan iterative activity considered Milestone
Both Sprints Releases Milestones Milestone action event marking significant change stage development
Milestone used often Project Management conversation general
It specifically Agile Scrum term meaning broad enough shown usable Agile context
A Sprint release sprint Releases
A Sprint iteration time product stable releasable form
A Release actually release product

The term part Scrum though Release Planning used
Milestones often part PMI project management vocabulary
There lot history software development term
Please start misunderstanding led waterfall process
The term release widely used classic They similar often used interchangeably often different meaning different people
The term come though groundwork philosophy started including
The reason release removed The Scrum Guide milestone never appeared long term planning contrary intent short iterative incremental cycle intended promote agility change direction seize opportunity reduce risk terminate effort longer acceptable

rapid application development RAD describes set value principle requirement solution evolve collaborative effort
It advocate adaptive planning evolutionary development early delivery continuous improvement encourages rapid flexible response change
These principle support definition continuing evolution many
The term sometimes written popularized defines value principle
Agile continue evolve two widely used
Iterative incremental software development method traced back
Evolutionary project management adaptive software development emerged early
During number software development method evolved reaction prevailing method critic described heavily regulated planned
These included DSDM Crystal Clear XP
Although originated publication collectively referred agile software development method
At time similar change underway manufacturing aerospace
In seventeen software developer met resort discus lightweight development method among others
Together published
In group headed wrote addendum principle guide software project management according agile software development method
In movement wrote extension principle guide agile software development according conduct mastery
In Agile Alliance created Guide Agile Practices renamed Agile Glossary evolving compendium working definition agile practice term element along interpretation experience guideline worldwide community agile practitioner
Based combined experience developing software helping others seventeen signatory manifesto proclaimed value That value item right value item left
By term meant Some author formed Agile Alliance organization promotes software development according manifesto value principle
Introducing manifesto behalf Agile Alliance said The Agile movement fact many u want restore credibility word methodology
We want restore balance
We embrace modeling order file diagram dusty corporate repository
We embrace documentation hundred page tome
We plan recognize limit planning turbulent environment
Those would brand proponent XP SCRUM Agile Methodologies hacker ignorant methodology original definition term hacker
The based twelve principle Most agile development method break product development work small increment minimize amount planning design
Iterations sprint short time frame typically last one four week
Each iteration involves working function
At end iteration working product demonstrated stakeholder
This minimizes overall risk allows product adapt change quickly
An iteration might add enough functionality warrant market release goal available release minimal end iteration
Multiple iteration might required release product new feature
Working software primary measure progress
No matter development method followed every team include Product Owner Scrum
This person agreed stakeholder act behalf make personal commitment available developer answer question throughout iteration
At end iteration stakeholder customer representative review progress priority view optimizing ROI ensuring alignment customer need company goal
In agile software development normally large physical display located prominently near development team see
It present summary product development status
A may also used inform team current status product development
A common characteristic agile software development also known
In brief session team member report previous day toward team iteration goal intend today toward goal roadblock impediment see goal
Specific tool technique automated technique often used improve quality enhance product development agility
Compared traditional software engineering agile software development mainly target complex system product development dynamic characteristic
Accurate estimate stable plan prediction often hard get early stage confidence likely low
Agile practitioner seek reduce needed evidence value obtained
Requirements design held emergent
Big specification would probably cause lot waste case economically sound
These basic argument previous industry experience learned year success failure helped shape agile development favor adaptive iterative evolutionary development
Development method exist continuum
Agile software development method lie side continuum
One key adaptive development method approach schedule planning identifies milestone leaf flexibility path reach also allows milestone change
method focus adapting quickly changing reality
When need project change adaptive team change well
An adaptive team difficulty describing exactly happen future
The away date vague adaptive method happen date
An adaptive team report exactly task next week feature plan next month
When asked release six month adaptive team might able report mission statement release statement expected value cost
method contrast focus analysing planning future detail cater known risk
In extreme predictive team report exactly feature task planned entire length development process
Predictive method rely effective early phase analysis go wrong project may difficulty changing direction
Predictive team often institute ensure consider valuable change
used choose adaptive predictive method
suggest side continuum follows One difference agile software development method waterfall approach quality testing
In always separate however agile software development testing completed iteration programming
Because testing done every develops small piece frequently use new piece software validate value
After user know real value updated piece software make better decision software future
Having value retrospective software session typically iteration two team continuously adapt plan maximize value delivers
This follows pattern similar cycle work review retrospective change agreed upon
This iterative approach support rather mindset
This provides greater flexibility throughout development process whereas project requirement defined locked beginning making difficult change later
Iterative product development allows software evolve response change business environment market requirement
Because short iteration style agile software development also strong connection concept
In letter Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism agile software development calling yet another attempt undermine discipline software engineering translating Working software comprehensive documentation We want spend time coding
Remember real programmer write documentation
This disputed proponent agile software development state developer write documentation best way achieve relevant goal often better way achieve goal writing static documentation
state documentation Just Barely Good Enough JBGE much comprehensive documentation would usually cause waste developer rarely trust detailed documentation usually sync code little documentation may also cause problem maintenance communication learning knowledge sharing
wrote method Crystal considers development series game intends documentation enough help next win next game
The work product Crystal include use case risk list iteration plan core domain model design note inform choice however template document description necessarily vague objective clear next game
I always tend characterize team would want know joined team tomorrow
Agile software development method support broad range
Some focus practice XP pragmatic programming agile modeling focus managing flow work Scrum Kanban
Some support activity requirement specification development FDD seek cover full development life cycle DSDM
Popular agile software development framework include limited Agile software development supported number concrete practice covering area like requirement design modeling coding testing planning risk management process quality etc
Some notable agile software development practice include The Agile Alliance provided comprehensive online guide applying agile practice
In literature different term refer notion method adaptation including tailoring fragment adaptation method engineering
Method tailoring defined A process capability human agent determine system development approach specific project situation responsive change dynamic interplay context intention method fragment
Potentially almost agile method suitable method tailoring
Even method used purpose successfully tailored context
considered distinguishing characteristic agile method traditional software development method latter relatively much rigid prescriptive
The practical implication agile method allow product development team adapt working practice according need individual product
Practices concrete activity product part method framework
At extreme level philosophy behind method consisting number principle could adapted Aydin
Some approach Scrum extreme programming make need method adaptation explicit
With framework one principle single process fit every product development rather practice tailored need product
Mehdi Mirakhorli proposes tailoring practice provides sufficient guideline adapting practice
designed customizing XP
This practice first proposed long research paper APSO workshop ICSE conference currently proposed applicable method customizing XP
Although specifically solution XP practice capability extending methodology
At first glance practice seems category static method adaptation experience RDP Practice say treated like dynamic method adaptation
The distinction static method adaptation dynamic method adaptation subtle
Scrum designed method tailoring
Schwaber note Scrum methodology need enhancing
That got trouble first place thinking problem perfect methodology
Effort center change enterprise needed
Bas Vodde reinforces statement suggesting Scrum like traditional large methodology require pick choose element
It basic top add additional element localise contextualise use
Agile software development widely seen highly suited certain type environment including small team expert working challenge limitation encountered adoption agile software development method large organization understood
In response range strategy pattern evolved overcoming challenge development effort developer distributed development team amongst challenge several recognised framework seek mitigate avoid challenge
There many conflicting viewpoint whether effective indeed fit definition agile development remains active ongoing area research
When agile software development applied distributed setting team dispersed across multiple business location commonly referred distributed agile development
The goal leverage unique benefit offered approach
Distributed development allow organization build software strategically setting team different part globe virtually building software commonly referred model
On hand agile development provides increased transparency continuous feedback flexibility responding change
Agile software development method initially seen best suitable product development thereby excluded use regulated domain medical device pharmaceutical financial nuclear system automotive avionics sector etc
However last several year several initiative adaptation agile method domain
There numerous standard may apply regulated domain including
A number key concern particular importance regulated domain The framework particular received considerable attention
Two derived method defined Regulated Scrum SafeScrum
Although agile software development method used programming paradigm language practice originally closely associated environment Smalltalk Lisp later Java
The initial adopter agile method usually small team working unprecedented system requirement difficult finalize likely change system developed
This section describes common problem organization encounter try adopt agile software development method well various technique measure quality performance agile team
Organizations team implementing agile software development often face difficulty transitioning traditional method team agile process forced
These often termed commonly
Below common example A goal agile software development focus producing working software le documentation
This contrast waterfall model process often highly controlled minor change system require significant revision supporting documentation
However justify completely without analysis design
Failure pay attention design cause team proceed rapidly first significant rework required attempt scale system
One key feature agile software development iterative
When done correctly design emerges system developed commonality opportunity discovered
In agile software development similar description typically used define requirement short period time team commits specific goal
Adding story iteration progress detrimental good flow work
These added product backlog prioritized subsequent iteration rare case iteration could cancelled
This mean story expand
Teams must deal new information may produce additional task story
If new information prevents story completed iteration carried subsequent iteration
However prioritized remaining story new information may changed story original priority
Agile software development often implemented grassroots effort organization software development team trying optimize development process ensure consistency software development life cycle
By sponsor support team may face difficulty resistance business partner development team management
Additionally may suffer without appropriate funding resource
This increase likelihood failure
A survey performed VersionOne found respondent cited insufficient training significant cause failed agile implementation Teams fallen trap assuming reduced process agile software development compared methodology waterfall mean actual rule agile software development
Agile software development set prescribed methodology requirement
The responsible representing business development activity often demanding role
A common mistake product owner role filled someone development team
This requires team make decision prioritization without real feedback business
They try solve business issue internally delay work reach outside team direction
This often lead distraction breakdown collaboration
Agile software development requires team meet product commitment mean focus work product
However team member appear spare capacity often expected take work make difficult help complete work team committed
Teams may fall trap spending much time preparing planning
This common trap team le familiar agile software development team feel obliged complete understanding specification story
Teams prepared move forward story confidence iteration continue discover prepare work subsequent iteration often referred grooming
A daily standup focused timely meeting team member disseminate information
If occurs often involve certain team member potentially best use entire team time
If daily standup team start diving set aside discus usually immediately standup completes
One intended benefit agile software development empower team make choice closest problem
Additionally make choice close implementation possible use timely information decision
If team member assigned task others early process benefit localized timely decision making lost
Being assigned work also constrains team member certain role example team member A must always database work limit opportunity
Team member choose take task stretch ability provide opportunity
Another common pitfall scrum master act contributor
While prohibited Scrum methodology scrum master need ensure capacity act role scrum master first working development task
A scrum master role facilitate process rather create product
Having scrum master also multitasking may result many context switch productive
Additionally scrum master responsible ensuring roadblock removed team make forward progress benefit gained individual task moving forward may outweigh roadblock deferred due lack capacity
Due iterative nature agile development multiple round testing often needed
Automated testing help reduce impact repeated unit integration regression test free developer tester focus higher value work
Test automation also support continued required iterative software development
Allowing developer quickly run test confirm refactoring modified functionality application may reduce workload increase confidence cleanup effort introduced new defect
Focusing delivering new functionality may result increased
The team must allow time defect remediation refactoring
Technical debt hinders planning ability increasing amount unscheduled work production defect distract team progress
As system evolves important entropy system naturally increase
Over time lack constant maintenance cause increasing defect development cost
A common misconception agile software development allows continuous change however iteration backlog agreement work completed iteration
Having much result inefficiency queueing
The team must avoid feeling pressured taking additional work
Agile software development fix time iteration duration quality ideally resource advance though maintaining fixed resource may difficult developer often pulled away task handle production incident scope remains variable
The customer product owner often push fixed scope iteration
However team reluctant commit locked time resource scope commonly known
Efforts add scope fixed time resource agile software development may result decreased quality
The best agile practitioner always emphasized sound engineering principle
As result number best practice tool measuring performance agile software development team
The amongst others rate development five dimension product development duration risk novelty effort interaction
Other technique based measurable goal one study suggests used metric agility
There also agile determine whether team using agile software development practice Nokia test Karlskrona test point test
One early study reporting gain quality productivity business satisfaction using agile software development method survey conducted Shine Technologies November January
A similar survey State Agile conducted every year starting thousand participant around software development community
This track trend benefit agility lesson learned good practice
Each survey reported increasing number saying agile software development help deliver software faster improves ability manage changing customer priority increase productivity
Surveys also consistently shown better result agile product development method compared classical project management
In balance report feel agile development method still young enable extensive academic research success
The term agile management applied iterative incremental method managing design build activity engineering information technology business area aim provide new product service development highly flexible interactive manner based principle expressed
Agile X technique may also called
It variant submitted stage
The main difference agile iterative development agile method complete small portion deliverable delivery cycle iteration iterative method evolve entire set deliverable time completing near end project
Both iterative agile method developed reaction various obstacle developed sequential form project organization
For example technology project grow complexity end user tend difficulty defining long term requirement without able view progressive prototype
Projects develop iteration constantly gather feedback help refine requirement
Agile management also offer simple framework promoting communication reflection past amongst member
Teams using traditional waterfall planning adopted agile way development typically go transformation phase often take help agile coach help guide team smooth transformation
There typically two style agile coaching
Agile management approach also employed adapted within business government sector
For example within USAID employing collaborative project management approach focus incorporating CLA strategy iterate adapt programming
Agile method mentioned Project Lifecycle definition project life cycle also known agile method intended facilitate change require high degree ongoing involvement
Adaptive life cycle also iterative incremental differ iteration rapid usually week length fixed time
According Richet Research Fellow Institute Strategic Innovation Services approach leveraged effectively product project management general especially area innovation uncertainty
The end result product project best meet current customer need delivered minimal cost waste time enabling company achieve bottom line gain earlier via traditional approach
Agile software development method extensively used development software product use certain characteristic software object technology
However technique applied development product computer motor vehicle medical device food clothing music see
Agile software development method used
Some wider principle agile software development also found application general management strategy governance risk finance term agile business management
Under agile business management model agile software development technique practice principle value expressed across five domain
Agile software development paradigm used area life raising child
Its success child development might founded basic management principle communication adaptation awareness
Bruce Feiler claimed basic agile development paradigm applied household management raising child
In TED Talk Agile programming family paradigm brought significant change household environment kid dish taking trash decreasing child emotional outbreak inadvertently increased emotional stability
Agile methodology inefficient large organization certain type development
Many organization believe agile software development methodology extreme adopt hybrid approach mix element agile software development approach
Some method DSDM attempt disciplined way without sacrificing fundamental principle
The term Agile also criticized simply describes existing good practice new jargon promotes one size fit mindset towards development strategy wrongly emphasizes method result
organized celebration anniversary Snowbird Utah February gathering people involved original meeting since
A list undiscussable agile collected including aspect alliance failure limitation agile software development practice context possible cause commercial interest decontextualization obvious way make progress based failure limited objective evidence cognitive bias reasoning fallacy politics culture
As wrote The agile movement way bit like teenager checking constantly appearance mirror accepting criticism interested peer rejecting en bloc wisdom past past adopting fad new jargon time cocky arrogant
But I doubt mature become open outside world reflective also therefore effective

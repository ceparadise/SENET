Integral differential calculus set mental tool use solve problem world
It easy dismiss irrelevant learning problem book entirely divorced reality plenty application
Reasoning algorithm performance say primary purpose computer science find way use unexpected way job
You know saying hammer everything look like nail
It true enough good luck hammering bolt
The integral differential calculus set good wrench applicable every job absolutely necessary one designed
I totally agree example I make presentation example integral calculus used computer engineering could I talk
The time I recall seeing used CS undergrad algorithm course
We used approximation series hard work approximation probability
Those us expected course since integral continuous version series easy find event whose probability nasty
The sort probability approximation used applied probability class numerous place
If look CLRS Algorithm Design textbook algorithm data structure I sure see I talking
Especially look section approximation algorithm problem performance different hash scheme
All could put heading us theoretical CS
It probably least useful compared discrete mathematics algebra logic field
But many application integral calculus especially computer graphic lighting raytracing physic engine basically force represenatations based calculus also computer vision
notation try describe function scale compared input size grows use lot stuff found calculus like comparing function using limit derivative etc
Some advanced method use integral calculus example
Integral calculus also often used probabilistic algorithm analysis le often approximation algorithm
In used analyze asymptotic behavior mathematical appear analysis substantially different size
It generalization assumes equal size
It depends sort work
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
For application science certain type engineering used daily basis
For run mill business application development certainly wo use calculus much
One example I think top head calculating total cost carrying inventory
Let say estimated cost per unit per day essentially use integral determine total cost inventory period time
But right business application require explicit use calculus
I sure accurate I always viewed calculus necessary order force certain level mathematical maturity
If handle handle discrete math linear algebra IMO relevant
It foundation I guess
Summations crop algorithm analysis I ca remember using integral solve CS problem
Fouier series transform laplace transform use integral basis signal processing analysis heat transfer
The precise value math constant computer language provide summing large range
Pi e An integral curve give area bound respect ax
And many application lazy Knowing turn function polynomial function computer compute
Continuous time Markov chain important application improving performance analysis computer network devising better routing algorithm
Integral calculus used calculate probability density function continuous random variable Markov chain

Many computer science program require two three calculus class
I wondering calculus used computer science
The CS content degree computer science tends focus algorithm operating system data structure artificial intelligence software engineering etc
Are time Calculus useful area Computer Science
We looking long answer provide explanation context
Do give answer explain answer right ideally citation
Answers include explanation may removed
I think course would need Calculus
I used bold face usually obligatory discipline Computer Science degree italic usually optional one
There may others top head
And besides one benefit Calculus course learning reason explain argument technical rigor
This valuable student usually think
This somewhat obscure calculus turn algebraic data type
For given type type context derivative type
See overview whole subject
This technical terminology let explain
You may come across tuples referred cartesian two type
We going take literally use notation b To represent tuple b type
Next may come across type either one type another known type kinda Haskell
We also going take one literally use notation b These named type value type b value type b value
These type look like normal algebraic expression fact manipulate point
In functional language common definition list given Haskell This say list either empty tuple value another list
Transforming algebraic notation get L L Where represents type one value aka unit type
By repeatedly inserting evaluate get definition L L L L L L L L L L Where meant sense repeated multiplication
This definition say list either unit tuple one item tuple two item three etc definition list
Now context context get value product type
Let give example For simple homogeneous take value get
But two different context type namely first second value tuple
So since either could write course
This differentiation come play
Let confirm another example Taking value give three different variant Depending put hole
This give u indeed derivative
There proof general
For final example let use list If take original expression list L L We rearrange get L On surface may seem like nonsense take taylor series result get definition derived earlier
Now differentiate get interesting result L L Thus one list become pair list
This fact make sense two list produced correspond element hole original list
Numerical Methods
There exist cumbersome calculus problem unique specific application need solution faster human practically solve without program
Someone design algorithm compute solution
Is thing separate programmer scientist
Similar robotics automation require quantifying lot human behavior
Finding solution proof often requires calculus
Utilizing advanced algorithm requires calculus co sine pi Especially calculating vector collision field meshing
Determining whether task possible risk involved possible rate success
Most security performed without calculus however many people want explanation prefer mathematical expression
The basic AI utilized without calculus however calculating advanced behavior swarm mind complex value based decision making
Visualizing health data requires calculus EKG reading
When working nearly scientific discipline requires calculus Aerospace Astrology Biology Chemistry Engineering
Many people programming go entire career without using calculus however prove invaluable willing work
For effective automation logistics visualization
By identifying specific pattern simply ignore pattern imitate pattern develop superior method together
The fact little chance ever use calculus
However virtually every scientific discipline DOES use calculus working science degree
There certain expectation university science degree supposed mean one thing know calculus
Even never use
It okay poorly calculus make sure put effort discrete mathematics
There lot programming problem discrete math come play ignorance principle embarrass front coder
Many people already provided application CS
But sometimes find Calculus least expect If know automaton pdf might worth reading
Some specific example To excellent answer I add point
In creating test case application I make use calculus predict expected running time memory size choose optimal parameter tuning data structure
This includes understanding expected rounding error etc
While statistic mentioned answer I would like specifically mention optimization algorithm based Mathematical principle include calculus
Specific industry I worked calculus required include Finance creating trading platform Insurance numerical integration insurance policy scenario compute expected policy loss Logistics optimizing consolidation transportation route Signal processing Calculus integral portion used directly CS foundation thinking summation
If work portion Knuth Concrete Mathematics section summation quickly recognize convention common calculus understanding continuous case give tool consider discrete
Many us CS study involve programming system monitor change case attempt predict future
The mathematics around system rooted differential equation linear algebra differential equation calculus
There teacher like Gibert Strang advocate moving quickly differential equation part still subset calculus
When change depends change system start unstable stable way well understood
To understand sensible linear system behaving nonlinear way either need tool calculus need problem space
And finally CS often requires reading understanding work others calculus first exposure lot shared vocabulary convention history

Want watch later
Have ever experienced major software upgrade even work
Do wonder better way execute software change
Are interested making real time change software release
Well continuous integration might right alley
CI agile process making small code change submitted daily
These small change reviewed daily program determine new code compatible existing software code
All programmer work software submit code change daily shared repository
The new code tested immediately address problem
The team visibility current programming creating much cohesive product
Continuous integration process split two separate phase
A continuous build contains code change
This occurs programmer individual work station
It simple code change submitted shared environment team larger code set stored
The test automation occurs two separate step
The compile portion test pull together code
Imagine jigsaw puzzle make sure piece fit together
The second set design make sense picture
This phase test make sure overall code cohesive
At point code flagged review rejected completely
There primarily two type testing API testing
Unit testing used understand code work
View unit testing like car wheel
You test wheel rolling bouncing make sure proper air function correctly
Unit test easy write contained small segment code
API testing testing unit module communicate
Imagine two car wheel join tire rod
The API test would similar process testing rod communicate wheel
A team work using continuous improvement stronger ongoing communication daily activity shared work environment
There several process requirement team Get FREE access day create account
Communication key strong process agile implementation
Due daily timing change must clear code tested revised
process making small code change software release submitting change daily basis test compatibility issue
There two part process
The code change present issue flagged rejected early process revised removed release
The test automation comprised two process test code fit together work overall
The benefit continuous integration include le backtracking time building feature shorter integration period frequent testing stronger communication
The sacrifice benefit costly initial testing setup well resource needed address issue frequently
There two form testing
Unit testing evaluates individual set code work typically simple write test
While API testing evaluates least two unit work together communicate
A cohesive team required clear policy around timing program pause software deployment
The strength CI process relies team rule put place

What continuous integration benefit
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
far best explanation I read far
At simplest simply mechanism rebuilds project whenever check made revision control system CVS etc
This extended though include running test way generating CD image mounting within VMs installing product running full test
It simple advantage highlighting code change break system early possible
Not detect break code highlight caused break
This psychological effect effective encouraging good testing prior check
It practice ensuring aspect software development process lined permit daily creation working version product
It best known part Extreme Programming
This involves thing far afield build automation automated testing daily using source code repository etc
But ultimate goal help entire project run according core Agile Principles deliver early often
This turn help leverage feedback user etc
link Fowler page
Personally I found nice know whenever something compile poor practice single build yes developed production build awesome
We got integrated testing phase I left
After however lessen amount massive coding change compared check pray change conflict rampant
Eventually developer started making small change frequently get confirmation tray icon
Overall I found comforting know could send build immediately
Had smoke test integrated I think would substantially lower
Just refresh
At point huge difference Continuous Integration CI Continuous Delivery CD
While post described CD I try show CI extends CD definition
Having tool needed build package deploy new version app automatically crucial part CD
Adding test automation based three level verification General Detailed Statistics Historical entry proper governance creating really good piece CI
Only extended definition building extraordinary cloud tool possible
Think muleESB
For CI something natural although second one supporting ESB ETL component
I hope helpful

How would define Continuous Integration specific component CI server contain
I want explain someone marketing department Continuous Integration
They understand Source control
use Subversion
But I like explain properly CI
The never properly defines give following basically tautology followed vague explanation Continuous Integration software development practice member team integrate work frequently usually person integrates least daily leading multiple integration per day
Each integration verified automated build including test detect integration error quickly possible
I sent image I could find simpler one
Feed back marketing chap time question I actually like answer different reason
I feel like logging thank
Obviously ca thanks behalf I realised looking Wikipedia article contain take heading quite good list When someone change file make software product attempt check word attempt change main product code want make sure software still successfully built
There usually external system called either periodically every change grab source file version control attempt build product
If CI server successfully build change successfully integrated
The CI server also able broadcast build failed succeeded system like Jenkins one used CI server today way send well web interface bunch information current past build code thing broke etc On image would CI important ensures continuous basis working product
This important developer working software well people want access daily release product like QA
I guess marketing department important
CI ideally mean produce new software every day ready presented sold customer new feature functionality bugfixes added
That mean deliver new version every day want
For example new feature set planned officially released er version software part feature set already coded integrated today marketing guy take current version software show le safely next conference
Without CI ask team unplanned code freeze every team member integrate feature working product might enough automatic test ready guess happen conference alpha version release much higher risk crashing especially new feature demonstrated
You ca know CI unless know used
Imagine system part
There UI gather data put database
There reporting system make report database
And sort server monitor database sends email alert certain criterion met
Long ago would written follows During time devs would run code try use version database created someone else code
The report writer would hand add bunch sample data
The alert writer would hand add record simulated report event
And GUI writer would look database see GUI added
Over time devs would realize spec wrong way specifying index short field length fix version
They might tell others might act usually thing would go list later
When three part completely coded tested devs sometimes even tested user showing report screen email alert would come integration phase
This often budgeted several month would still go
That field length change dev would discovered would require devs make huge code change possibly UI change
That extra index would wreak havoc
And
If one devs told user add field would time two add also
This phase brutally painful pretty much impossible predict
So people began say integrate often
We work together beginning
When one u raise change request talked others know
Some team began integration test earlier continuing work separately
And team began use code output time beginning
And became Continuous Integration
You may think I exaggerating first story
I work company contact chewed checking code suffered following flaw It opinion put stuff source control DONE
He typically one two checkins YEAR
We bit philosophy difference Also find hard believe team would disconnected around shared resource like database really wo believe true approach taken code
You going write function I call
That great go ahead I hardcode I need meantime
Months later I integrate code call API discover blow I pas null I blow return null lot return thing large ca handle leap year thousand thing
Working independently integration phase normal
Now sound like insanity

We thinking Continuous Integration nightly build
Some sticking point code review
Is anyone Continuous Integration nightly build AND code review
If give brief outline process would great
For example Developers attempt check code daily often possible
Code done merely compile
They rebase code everyone else change time
Doing often prevents u merging nightmare
Builds come nightly QA look build write bug yet merely inform u seeing
Every day official release
Code Reviewed
We write description ready testing
QA writes find stuff say ready test
The process start
So wrong
One thing I like code checked reviewed
I heard code checked reviewed however I sure still programmer code daily
If give example process I really appreciate
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
At work I set process Git Gerrit custom CI script
Here work Gerrit manages review process well allows people check change review time ca surreptitiously accidentally change review passed
Our environment critical production software change must signed inclusion merge commit go Gerrit well
Separating review change merge commit review mean two step done different time
Reviewing code necessarily mean go live
By posting answer agree

In practice merging developer working copy shared several time day
first named proposed CI although advocate integrating several time day
XP adopted concept CI advocate integrating per day perhaps many ten time per day
The main aim CI prevent integration problem referred integration hell early description XP
CI universally accepted improvement frequent integration important distinguish two disagreement virtue
In XP CI intended used combination automated unit test written practice
Initially conceived running unit test developer local verifying passed committing mainline
This help avoid one developer breaking another developer copy
If necessary partially complete feature disabled commit using
Later elaboration concept introduced build server automatically ran unit test periodically even every commit reported result developer
The use build server necessarily running unit test already practised team outside XP community
Nowadays many organisation adopted CI without adopting XP
In addition automated unit test organisation using CI typically use build server implement process applying general small piece effort applied frequently
In addition running unit integration test process run additional static dynamic test measure profile performance extract format documentation source code facilitate manual process
This continuous application quality control aim improve reduce time taken deliver replacing traditional practice applying quality control completing development
This similar original idea integrating frequently make integration easier applied QA process
In vein practice extends CI making sure software checked mainline always state deployed user make actual deployment process rapid
When embarking change take copy current work
As developer submit changed code copy gradually cease reflect repository code
Not existing code base change new code added well new library resource create dependency potential conflict
The longer branch code remains checked greater risk multiple integration conflict failure developer branch reintegrated main line
When developer submit code repository must first update code reflect change repository since took copy
The change repository contains work developer must submitting change
Eventually repository may become different developer baseline enter sometimes referred merge hell integration hell time take integrate exceeds time took make original change
Continuous integration involves integrating early often avoid pitfall integration hell
The practice aim reduce rework thus reduce cost time
A complementary practice CI submitting work programmer must complete build run pas
usually run automatically CI server detects new commit
In Grady Booch used phrase continuous integration Analysis Design Applications edition explain developing using micro process internal release represent sort continuous integration system exist force closure micro process
In invented XP project including continuous integration
Beck published continuous integration emphasising importance communication technological support
In Beck elaborated first full book Extreme Programming
released
This section list suggested various author achieve continuous integration automate practice
best practice
Continuous integration practice frequently integrating one new changed code existing code repository occur frequently enough intervening window remains error arise without developer noticing correcting immediately
Normal practice trigger build every commit repository rather periodically scheduled build
The practicality environment rapid commits usual trigger short time commit start build either timer expires rather longer interval since last build
Many automated tool offer scheduling automatically
Another factor need version control system support
developer change may seen single commit operation
There point trying build half changed file
To achieve objective continuous integration relies following principle
This practice advocate use revision control system project source code
All artifact required build project placed repository
In practice revision control community convention system buildable fresh checkout require additional dependency
advocate also mention supported tool use minimised
Instead preferred change integrated rather multiple version software maintained simultaneously
The mainline place working version software
A single command capability building system
Many build tool existed many year
frequently used continuous integration environment
Automation build include automating integration often includes
In many case build script compiles binary also generates documentation website page statistic distribution medium Debian Red Hat Windows file
Once code built test run confirm behaves developer expect behave
By committing regularly every committer reduce number conflicting change
Checking week worth work run risk conflicting feature difficult resolve
Early small conflict area system cause team member communicate change making
Committing change least day per feature built generally considered part definition Continuous Integration
In addition performing generally recommended
These lower bound typical frequency expected much higher
The system build commits current working version verify integrate correctly
A common practice use Automated Continuous Integration although may done manually
For many continuous integration synonymous using Automated Continuous Integration continuous integration server monitor change automatically run build process
The build need complete rapidly problem integration quickly identified
Having lead failure tested system deploy production environment may differ test environment significant way
However building replica production environment cost prohibitive
Instead test environment separate staging built scalable version actual production environment alleviate cost maintaining composition nuance
Within test environment commonly used obtain access dependency APIs application service etc
beyond team control still evolving complex configure virtual test lab
Making build readily available stakeholder tester reduce amount rework necessary rebuilding feature meet requirement
Additionally early testing reduces chance defect survive deployment
Finding error earlier also case reduces amount work necessary resolve
All programmer start day updating project repository
That way stay date
It easy find whether build break made relevant change
Most CI system allow running script build finish
In situation possible write script deploy application live test server everyone look
A advance way thinking call software deployed directly production often additional automation prevent defect regression
Continuous integration intended produce benefit With continuous automated testing benefit include Some downside continuous integration include

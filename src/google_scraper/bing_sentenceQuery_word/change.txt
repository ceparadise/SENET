In program described designed remember preceding event user interaction remembered information called system
The set state system occupy known
In state space often system internal behaviour interaction environment consists separately occurring individual action event accepting input producing output may may cause system change state
Examples system circuit component
The output digital circuit computer program time completely determined current input state
circuit divided two type whose output dependent present input signal whose output function current input past history input
In sequential logic information past input stored electronic memory element
The stored content memory element given point time collectively referred circuit contains information past circuit access
Since two possible state finite number memory element digital circuit certain finite number possible state
If number binary memory element circuit maximum number state circuit
Similarly computer program store data represent storage location computer
The content memory location given point program execution called program
way designing describes computation term program state statement change program state
In language program describes desired result specify change state directly
A specialized definition state used computer program operate sequentially stream data program
Serial program operate incoming data character packet sequentially one time
In program information previous data character packet received stored variable used affect processing current character packet
This called data carried previous processing cycle called state
In others program information previous data stream start fresh data input called
The output sequential circuit computer program time completely determined current input current state
Since memory element two possible state total number different state circuit assume finite fixed number memory element
If binary memory element digital circuit distinct state
The concept state formalized abstract mathematical called used design sequential digital circuit computer program
An example everyday device state
To change channel TV user usually press channel channel button remote control sends coded message set
In order calculate new channel user desire digital tuner television must stored number
It add one subtracts one number get number new channel adjusts TV receive channel

Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Science always look explanation go explanation natural world exactly get done may evolve
The scientific enterprise static
Science deeply interwoven society changed science
Here example modern scientific practice transformed increasing knowledge changing societal concern advance communication
The rise Internet enabled scientific result publicized rapidly ever possible
article often made available online even printed
This swift distribution information speed pace science since latest study scrutinized built upon little lag time
And journal provide record reader comment article process extended many scientist provide feedback particular article may long article original publication
But information flow stop
Journalists also quickly access latest scientific finding begin publicize broader population
Scientific information wide variety topic available anyone Internet connection make staying informed convenient also carry responsibility
Consumers information must remember science first report finding never last word
Many year multiple round testing may required science confident particular conclusion
With much information many different source important ever critical consumer medium message science
In fact scientist especially young scientist beginning change way communicate freely sharing information sometimes making available online published
Read new trend article
New medium also playing increasingly important role modern science
Check new movement scientific publishing video
You even listen scientist coffee break discussion recent paper problem idea checking online forum like Technological advance also added additional step review many scientific article undergo image analysis
In Woo Suk Hwang announced scientific community rest world reached milestone biology cloning human embryonic stem cell
Over next two year partly close scrutiny image published work appeared duplicated manipulated breakthrough revealed fraud
As case like Huang come light many journal begun carefully scrutinize image scientific paper often using computer program digitally analyze picture hunt manipulation
As scientific knowledge advanced question seek answer become complex science become specialized
While Charles Darwin research seems known bound studied everything evolutionary theory geology human emotion soil ecology tropical coral barnacle botany modern scientist much likely focus narrower topic salamander development example ancient climate change aquatic ecosystem
It modern scientist interest range le widely knowledge expanded degree developing expertise resource necessary conduct research cutting edge field represent huge investment time effort
Because modern scientist tend specialized predecessor
This specialization along complexity question modern science investigates necessitated collaboration past
For example recent project investigating desertification Southern Europe involved collaboration sociologist anthropologist archaeologist agronomist biologist mathematical modeler
In addition scientist today likely work large team regardless disciplinary specialization
In average number author science engineering article around
As number reached appeared rise
The extreme example modern scientific teamwork truly astounding
The paper reporting initial sequence human genome thousand author similar number physicist involved Large Hadron Collider recent project particle physic
Happily advance communication especially Internet smoothed water transition team science
Ideas plan data easily shared regardless distance political institutional boundary
In fact many largest project make raw data publically available via Internet anyone scrutinize use investigation
The process science clearly evolves along advance knowledge technology societal concern
The Internet opened new way scientist share information work project together
Our expanding knowledge base influenced degree scientist specialize correspondingly much collaborate
And course scientific community broader society embedded become increasingly concerned safety environmental protection treatment animal human study participant new limit placed research carried
These shift suggest fundamental change science work still finding explanation phenomenon natural world hold multiple scrutiny scientific community highlight flexibility process science accommodate new concern build upon new opportunity

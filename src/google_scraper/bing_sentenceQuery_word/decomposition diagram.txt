Before computer solve problem problem way resolved must understood
Decomposition help breaking complex problem manageable part
Decomposition one four cornerstone Computer Science
It
The smaller part examined solved designed individually simpler work
If problem decomposed much harder solve
Dealing many different stage much difficult breaking problem number smaller problem solving one one time
Breaking problem smaller part mean smaller problem examined detail
Similarly trying understand complex system work easier using decomposition
For example understanding bicycle work straightforward whole bike separated smaller part part examined see work detail

PCs smartphones also known general purpose machine
Most computer system follow input process output model
Abstraction decomposition key computing skill
A key difference human computer computer CPU need programmed follow set logical instruction
Some key concept behind working computer include
mean understanding represent problem way computer able solve
This involves breaking problem series logical step
You use computational thinking think translate process computer understand
An example might making sandwich
This something human could without list instruction robot asked would need series clear basic step follow
The process would need broken series detailed simple logical step using computational thinking
mean breaking large problem smaller chunk solved using computing
Some computer game take year create hundred people create software working individual section
A big project like decomposed smaller problem different team developer work one
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
Facebook Jackson Gabbard explains decomposition important skill computer programmer mean reducing something simple set characteristic chosen relevant problem
In computing abstraction used hide data reduce amount data needed problem solved
For example person might abstractly described name date birth simple
A programmer look way simplify piece code sequence algorithm make efficient possible save time speed program

Functional Decomposition useful
Where worked example used
Functional Decomposition process taking complex process breaking smaller simpler part
For instance think using ATM
You could decompose process Walk ATM Insert bank card Enter pin well get point
You think programming way
Think software running ATM Code reading card PIN verification Transfer Processing Each broken
Once reached decomposed piece subsystem think start coding piece
You compose small part greater whole
Check Wikipedia Article The benefit functional decomposition start coding working simplest component possibly work application
Therefore developing testing component becomes much easier mention better able architect code project fit need
The obvious downside time investment
To perform functional decomposition complex system take trivial amount time BEFORE coding begin
Personally I think amount time well worth
It WorkBreakDown Structures WBS mindMapping top development basically breaking large problem smaller comprehensible
Pros Cons real CONS decomposition however common mistake Functional decomposition way breaking complex problem simpler problem based task need performed rather data relationship
This term usually associated older design
Here example C compiler
First preprocessor handle macro
You give file name option return really long string
Let call function
Then lexical analyzer
It take string break token
Call
The parser take token turn tree call
Then function converting tree DAG block call
Call code emitter take DAG block spit assembler
The compiler We decomposed big difficult understand function function bunch smaller easier understand function
You pipeline could write program This typical compiler fairly deep program program broad comparison
Functional decomposition helpful prior creating functional requirement document
If need software something functional decomposition answer question What function software must provide
Decomposing needed define function
I need software energy efficiency measurement general
That break smaller piece point clearly understand function system need provide
This later used checklist completeness system
A functional requirement document FD basically textual representation functional decomposition
Coding directly FD may ok procedural language good enough solution identify object
Neither good usability planning testing
My opinion take time create FD use much time
Consult every person know process following system find function needed
I lot experience software design development selling I use functional decomposition first step development
I use base contract client know get I know I must provide
By posting answer agree

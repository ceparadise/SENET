operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Τhis sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

A button many allows reset computer
When press reset button computer enter turned power
Generally would use reset button error caused computer
Note pressing reset button somewhat different performing warm pressing reboot
Pressing reset button performs reboot
When perform warm reboot repeat initial stage checked

In system clear pending error event brings system normal condition initial state usually controlled manner
It usually done response error condition impossible undesirable processing activity proceed error recovery mechanism fail
A would normally perform reset command error recovery scheme like retry also fail
Most computer reset brings device startup state active short time powering
For example architecture asserting RESET line halt CPU done system switched power supply asserted power good indicate ready supply stable voltage sufficient power level
Reset place le stress hardware power removed
Many computer especially older model user accessible reset button assert reset line facilitate system reboot way trapped
prevented operating system
also frequently provides possibility reset remote system way
Many digital circuit register counter accept reset signal set state
This signal often applied powering may also applied circumstance
The ability electronic device able reset case error abnormal power loss important aspect design
This ability observed everyday electronics audio equipment electronics able function intended even lost power suddenly
A sudden strange error device might sometimes fixed removing restoring power making device reset
Some device often dedicated reset button prone freezing locking
The lack proper reset ability could otherwise possibly render device useless power loss malfunction
A performed restarting without resetting hardware

In addition command restore console normal state
This command alias terminal initialization command
Similar command include

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A hard reset also known factory reset master reset restoration device state left factory
All setting application data added user removed
The term often heard reference smartphones tablet laptop desktop computer well electronic device usually restored factory condition
Factory reset may accomplished various procedure depending particular device may available device operating system feature
example feature era setting user data application associated application data device internal
The common reason restore factory condition fix malfunctioning device remove user data selling otherwise disposing device returning manufacturer
Hard reset contrast mean restart device

To reboot restart computer operating system
The common reason reboot installation new software hardware requires application responding reason
On computer running Windows usually reboot selecting turn computer start menu clicking restart window pop

Computer Science The Profession Computer science discipline involves understanding design computer computational process
In general form concerned understanding information transfer transformation
Particular interest placed making process efficient endowing form intelligence
The discipline range theoretical study algorithm practical problem implementation term computational hardware software
A central focus process handling manipulating information
Thus discipline span advancing fundamental understanding algorithm information process general well practical design efficient reliable software hardware meet given specification
Computer science young discipline evolving rapidly beginning
As includes theoretical study experimental method engineering design one discipline
This differs radically physical science separate understanding advancement science application science field engineering design implementation
In computer science inherent intermingling theoretical concept computability algorithmic efficiency modern practical advancement electronics continue stimulate advance discipline
It close interaction theoretical design aspect field bind together single discipline
Because rapid evolution difficult provide complete list computer science area
Yet clear crucial area theory algorithm data structure programming methodology language computer element architecture
Other area include software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation
A professional computer scientist must firm foundation crucial area field likely knowledge one area discipline depending upon person particular area practice
Thus well educated computer scientist able apply fundamental concept technique computation algorithm computer design specific design problem
The work includes detailing specification analysis problem provides design function desired satisfactory performance reliable maintainable meet desired cost criterion
Clearly computer scientist must sufficient training computer science area able accomplish task must also firm understanding area mathematics science well broad education liberal study provide basis understanding societal implication work performed

In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

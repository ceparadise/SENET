Sync short synchronize
When sync device cell phone synchronize data computer
This typically done connecting device computer via wireless connection
For example might sync address book stored computer cell phone update contact
If iPod may connect computer sync song video data using Apple
When sync device computer typically update device computer recent information
This also referred merging data
For example added phone number phone since last time synced computer number added computer address book
Similarly number entered computer address book since last sync added phone
Most syncing program also remove entry either device computer since last sync
Since many device synced single computer computer often referred hub syncing portable electronics
For example might able sync iPod Blackberry PDA using address book computer
However may need use different syncing program device since use proprietary software sync computer
Common syncing program include iTunes The Missing Sync Palm Desktop iSync

In refers one two distinct related concept synchronization synchronization
refers idea multiple process join certain point order reach agreement commit certain sequence action
refers idea keeping multiple copy dataset coherence one another maintain
Process synchronization primitive commonly used implement data synchronization
The need synchronization arise merely system kind concurrent process even single processor system
Mentioned main need synchronization When job arrives fork point split N serviced n task
After serviced wait done processing
Then joined leave system
Thus parallel programming require synchronization parallel process wait several process occur
In relationship consumer process dependent producer process till necessary data produced
When multiple process dependent resource need access time operating system need ensure one processor access given point reduces concurrency
Thread synchronization defined mechanism ensures two concurrent simultaneously execute particular program segment known
Processes access critical section controlled using synchronization technique
When one thread start executing serialized segment program thread wait first thread finish
If proper synchronization technique applied may cause value variable may unpredictable vary depending timing process thread
For example suppose three process namely
All three concurrently executing need share common resource critical section shown Figure
Synchronization used avoid conflict accessing shared resource
Hence Process try access resource assigned one process time
If assigned Process process Process need wait Process free resource shown Figure
Another synchronization requirement need considered order particular process thread executed
For example board plane buy ticket
Similarly check without validating credential user name password
In way ATM provide service provide correct PIN
Other mutual exclusion synchronization also deal following One challenge exascale algorithm design minimize reduce synchronization
Synchronization take time computation especially distributed computing
Reducing synchronization drew attention computer scientist decade
Whereas becomes increasingly significant problem recently gap improvement computing latency increase
Experiments shown global communication due synchronization distributed computer take dominated share sparse iterative solver
This problem receiving increasing attention emergence new benchmark metric High Performance Conjugate Gradient HPCG ranking top supercomputer
The following classic problem synchronization These problem used test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme primitive
Many system provide hardware support code
A single processor could disable executing currently running code without inefficient system
The key ability require implement synchronization multiprocessor set hardware primitive ability atomically read modify memory location
Without capability cost building basic synchronization primitive high increase processor count increase
There number alternative formulation basic hardware primitive provide ability atomically read modify location together way tell read write performed atomically
These hardware primitive basic building block used build wide variety synchronization operation including thing
In general architect expect user employ basic hardware primitive instead expect primitive used system programmer build synchronization library process often complex tricky
Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instruction either memory word content two memory word
In prevent thread interference memory consistency error block code wrapped section
This force thread acquire said lock object execute block
The lock automatically released thread leaf block enter waiting state within block
Any variable update made thread synchronized block become visible thread whenever thread similarly acquires lock
In addition mutual exclusion memory consistency Java block enable signaling sending event thread acquired lock execute code block waiting lock within block
This mean Java synchronized section combine functionality mutexes event
Such primitive known
Any object fine used Java
The declaring object implicitly implied lock object whole method marked
The synchronization primitive
Synchronization designed cooperative demanding every thread process follow synchronization mechanism accessing protected resource critical section consistent result
In locking signaling lightweight synchronization type spinwait interlocked operation mechanism related synchronization
Another effective way implementing synchronization using spinlocks
Before accessing shared resource piece code every processor check flag
If flag reset processor set flag continues executing thread
But flag set locked thread would keep spinning loop keep checking flag set
But spinlocks effective flag reset lower cycle otherwise lead performance issue waste many processor cycle waiting
Barriers simple implement provide good responsiveness
They based concept implementing wait cycle provide synchronization
Consider three thread running simultaneously starting barrier
After time reach barrier still wait thread reach correct data
Once thread reach barrier start
After time thread reach wait thread correct data
Thus barrier synchronization multiple thread always thread end waiting thread example thread keep waiting thread
This result severe degradation process performance
The barrier synchronization wait function thread represented Wbarrier f Tbarrier Rthread Where Wbarrier wait time thread Tbarrier number thread arrived Rthread arrival rate thread
Experiments show total execution time spent waiting slower thread
Semaphores signalling mechanism allow one access section
A Semaphore flag certain fixed value associated time thread wish access section decrement flag
Similarly thread leaf section flag incremented
If flag zero thread access section get blocked chooses wait
Some semaphore would allow one thread process code section
Such Semaphores called binary semaphore similar Mutex
Here value semaphore thread allowed access value access denied
Synchronization originally concept whereby lock could obtained object
Its primary usage database
There two type file
lock may obtained many process thread
lock exclusive may used single time
Although lock derived file database data also shared memory process thread
Sometimes one object file locked time
If locked simultaneously overlap causing deadlock exception
exclusive lock thread based rely processor instruction
An abstract mathematical foundation synchronization primitive given
There also many theoretical device built top history monoid
Following synchronization example respect different platform
provides provides Enabling disabling kernel preemption replaced spinlocks uniprocessor system
Prior kernel version disabled interrupt implement short critical section
Since version later Linux fully preemptive
provides provides A distinctly different related concept
This refers need keep multiple copy set data coherent one another maintain Figure
For example database replication used keep multiple copy data synchronized database server store data different location
Examples include Some challenge user may face data synchronization When start something data usually simple format
It varies time organization grows evolves result building simple interface two application source target also need transform data passing target application
extraction transformation loading tool helpful stage managing data format complexity
This era system
Customers want see current status order current status parcel real time parcel current balance account etc
This show need system updated well enable smooth manufacturing process ordering material enterprise running stock synchronizing customer order manufacturing process etc
From real life exist many example processing give successful competitive advantage
There fixed rule policy enforce data security
It may vary depending system using
Even though security maintained correctly source system capture data security information access privilege must enforced target system well prevent potential misuse information
This serious issue particularly come handling secret confidential personal information
So sensitivity confidentiality data transfer information must encrypted
Data quality another serious constraint
For better management maintain good quality data common practice store data one location share different people different system application different location
It help preventing inconsistency data
There five different phase involved data synchronization process Each step critical
In case large amount data synchronization process need carefully planned executed avoid negative impact performance

How someone synchronize two thread using serialization
According professor slide code assignment use serialization solve synchronization problem
He explain serialization
I tried research serialization mean put data specific order
I would understand mean thing case Running thread specific order
But I confused syntax question
My question Does serialization mean synchronization
How would one synchronize thread using serialization
Two thread executing require synchronization least one thread access modifies one variable write access accessed remaining thread either read write access
Therefore thread access set variable reading value read access synchronization needed
You probably know access variable multiple thread least one writes least one variable must happen critical region code
You synchronize access providing using instance Posix mutex lock
This permit concurrent execution multiple thread execution preserve correctness updating one variable involved
Of course concurrent execution multiple thread efficient way writing code general
However may also imagine different execution operation associated thread executed sequentially concurrently one order concurrent correct execution
This called
What mean strictly equivalent
Serialization must provide requirement exactly result provided concurrent correct execution
Note multiple possible concurrent correct execution outcome must one one
Now really want use serialization synchronize thread
The answer serialized execution general slower concurrent execution obvious since execution sequential concurrent
In practice serialization give correctness
You want thread execute concurrently performance reason however must ensure outcome correct independently actual concurrent execution took place
As example imagine two thread accessing variable amount money deposited bank
If thread want read amount money issue arises
However one thread want modify value problem arises need synchronize access
For instance one thread may depositing money account bank thread withdrawing money account wife ATM
In case access variable holding amount money must synchronized
Serialization case simple must either first withdraw money add money first add money bank account withdraw money
In case serialization provides correct outcome
To grant correct outcome case concurrent execution must instead protect variable using mutex lock access variable mutually exclusive thread
Otherwise value variable accessed thread without proper synchronization actually undefined bad money
You may example loose part money
Another type synchronization related mutual exclusion
Imagine instance one thread execute operation another thread completed
Another example thread execute specific condition true condition depends another thread includes previous example general requirement based evaluation predicate
For instance may synchronize thread way using Posix mutex lock condition variable
Serialization thoroughly studied context database transaction
A provides criterion correctness execution concurrent transaction database protocol ensure proper synchronization locking
But concept applies equally well thread well
By posting answer agree

I looking explanation reference implementation computer clock
To keep question level logical abstraction say put together combinational sequential logic basic gate
The role clock oscillator sort going detail needed abstraction synchronise unorderly chorus input output passing gate
Exactly clock synchronize signal
To render thing concrete Take NAND gate
Say I set two input high signal obtain inherent delay stable low signal end
Now add basic sequential logic inverter let add Data DFF
The effect certain end DFF broadcast low signal definitively start next clock cycle
What happens within cycle trusted
The clock period set circuitry NAND gate case time stabilize cycle
This contract
But achieved
The metaphor mind clock act sluice
But comparison misleading signal entering exiting DFF truncated point
We could physically measure signal within cycle clock end DFF
Another metaphor would motion orchestra rehearsal gradually transforming attuned performance conductor setting beat
How signal attuned clock oscillation distinguished propagating gate circuitry time
I realize may missing part picture question framed constructive term Judging response question original question must poorly phrased
I understand reason behind choice frequency system clock ensure circuit stable tick clock
The response emphasize contractual side thing
My question really contract hold
In retrospect I getting trivial fact measuring instrument system clock must selected based degree precision required typical case discussed human sluggish attention span
To illustrate graph clock pulse Qa output DFF
Say clock cycle Captain Marvel sends pulse line oblivious clock period expects read immediately
With lightning speed way make sense output circuit clock cycle geological time
Billy Watson hand read fine
Neither Captain Billy synchronized system clock
Not sense gate circuitry
But Billy experience time clock time scale sufficiently precise
You good understanding clocking mechanism register really implemented using clocked memory used get final reading propagation signal stabilized
But question The clock period set circuitry NAND gate case time stabilize cycle
This contract
But achieved
Perhaps overthinking
It never achieved
Rather specified
Basically read user manual engineering usually data sheet
If user manual say maximum clock supply clock
That basic mechanism achieved
So I already see next question forming How designer know specify
It ca arbitrary
The basic way done calculate timing propagation
Say circuit Lets say OR AND gate propagation time
Lets also circuit make thing clearer So circuit longest path output input D It pass four gate assuming gate two input three level use three input OR gate
Since gate take stabilize circuit sampled rate every
The calculation simplified course
It assumes wire zero propagation time also assume input simultaneous
CAD software calculate propagation time even lengthen trace necessary ensure signal arrive time
As simultaneity input user engineer using component problem
If output circuit take time stabilize going circuit take account use slower clock allow signal stabilize
There also dirty way calculation overclocking
You keep increasing clock frequency system fails back bit work back bit allow overhead
There also third question part assumption almost every digital designer When clock SURE input stabilized
We accounted output gate input
The answer input circuit come form another circuit system
They synchronize using clock
Since clocked end previous clock cycle assume stable beginning clock cycle
Which consider propagation gate limiting factor stability signal
All signal signal share clock must sampled
That part reason external signal never fast internal clock allow stable register somewhere signaling internal circuit ready enter system
So general term signal stability assume noise exists clock pulse signal entire system stabilize next clock pulse
That effectively defines maximum clock rate
I feel multiple question post
I attempt answer first Shown transistor level circuit D shown picture post
If replace schematic picture see signal propagates D input Q output
Your second question Logic distinguish signal noise
Noise signal
It usually unwanted signal signal
It job designer ensure noise various source pollute actual signal much result incorrect reading Q output
Circuits amount noise immunity
Chips cell library designed noise cross specified noise immunity circuit
From question seems already answer acknowledging answer
It exactly describe The logic circuit take time stabilize
This given description circuit adding longest path path
There additional delay I discus
Once know set clock oscillation
That gap least time one clock tick cause change logic circuit next clock tick sample new output
By second click output already stable
This second click trigger change input change output time output stable another clock tick allowed
So basic idea By posting answer agree

I question regarding usage significance keyword
The keyword different thread reading writing variable object resource
This trivial topic quote Sun method enable simple strategy preventing thread interference memory consistency error object visible one thread read writes object variable done synchronized method
When two thread reading writing say variable named need ensure thread access variable atomic way
Without keyword thread may see change thread made worse may half changed
This would logically expect
Again topic
To learn explore topic SO Interwebs Keep exploring topic name becomes permanently associated term brain
Well I think enough theoretical explanation consider code Note block next thread call method test long previous thread execution finished
Threads access method one time
Without thread access method simultaneously
When thread call synchronized method object object instance class acquires lock object new thread call ANY synchronized method object long previous thread acquired lock release lock
Similar thing happens static synchronized method class called
The thread acquires lock associated class case non static synchronized method instance class called thread object level lock still available
Any thread able call static synchronized method class long class level lock released thread currently hold lock
The keyword prevents concurrent access block code object multiple Threads
By default one thread access table time
On usage construct like must build thread safety feature code prevent memory consistency error
mean multi threaded environment object method let two thread access method code time
This mean one thread ca read another thread update
The second thread instead wait first thread completes execution
The overhead speed advantage guaranteed consistency data
If application single threaded though block provide benefit
The keyword cause thread obtain lock entering method one thread execute method time given object instance unless static method
This frequently called making class I would say euphemism
While true synchronization protects internal state Vector getting corrupted usually help user Vector much
Consider Even though method involved synchronized locked unlocked individually two unfortunately timed thread create vector two element
So effect synchronize application code well
Because synchronization expensive need b insufficient need synchronization replacement ArrayList case Vector
More recently concurrency package released number clever utility take care issue
Synchronized keyword Java multiple thread read write variable
The synchronized keyword used define block code multiple thread access variable safe way
keyword take parameter called followed
When execution encounter keyword current thread try take pick execute associated block code lock acquired
Any writes variable inside synchronized code block guaranteed visible every thread similarly executes code inside synchronized code block using
Only one thread time hold lock time thread trying acquire wait pause execution
The lock released execution exit synchronized code block
Adding keyword method definition equal entire method body wrapped synchronized code block
Without synchronization guaranteed order read writes happen possibly leaving variable garbage
It enough complete write operation thread time another thread read hardware could cached value variable reading thread would see cached value instead written
Thus Java case follow Java Memory Model ensure threading error happen
Think kind turnstile like might find football ground
There parallel steam people wanting get turnstile
Only one person time get
All wanting get may wait go
What synchronized keyword
Threads communicate primarily sharing access field object reference field refer
This form communication extremely efficient make two kind error possible
The tool needed prevent error synchronization
Synchronized block method prevents thread interference make sure data consistent
At point time one thread access synchronized block method acquiring lock
Other thread wait release lock access
When method synchronized
Methods synchronized add method definition declaration
You also synchronize particular block code method
What mean pro grammatically logically
It mean one thread access acquiring lock
Unless thread release lock thread wait acquire lock
They access enter acquiring lock
This ca done magic
It programmer responsibility identify application guard accordingly
Java provides framework guard application section guarded responsibility programmer
More detail java documentation Synchronization built around internal entity known intrinsic lock monitor lock
Intrinsic lock play role aspect synchronization enforcing exclusive access object state establishing relationship essential visibility

By convention thread need exclusive consistent access object field acquire object intrinsic lock accessing release intrinsic lock done
A thread said intrinsic lock time acquired lock released lock
The thread block attempt acquire lock
When thread release intrinsic lock relationship established action subsequent acquisition lock
Making method synchronized two First possible two invocation synchronized method object interleave
When one thread executing synchronized method object thread invoke synchronized method object block suspend execution first thread done object
Second synchronized method exit automatically establishes relationship subsequent invocation synchronized method object
This guarantee change state object visible thread
Look alternative synchronization To understanding synchronized basically mean compiler write around method
As may thread safe depending used I mean write object synchronized method threadsafe depending class
I know already gotten answer
I write help people question looking page answer
explanation Consider following code instance making method synchronized two effect synchronized simple mean two thread access simultaneously
When say class synchronized mean one thread access time
Internally thread try access first take lock object long lock available thread access synchronized instance class
Note another thread access method object defined synchronized
A thread release lock calling What answer missing one important aspect
Thread synchronization basically consists part serialization visibility
I advise everyone google jvm memory barrier extremely important topic modify shared data accessed multiple thread
Having done I advise looking package class help avoid using explicit synchronization turn help keeping program simple efficient maybe even preventing deadlock
One example
Together allows create highly efficient worker thread stuffing command concurrent queue explicit synchronization needed deadlock possible explicit sleep necessary poll queue calling take
In short memory synchronization happens start thread thread end read volatile variable unlock monitor leave synchronized etc
This synchronization affect sense flush writes done particular action
In case aforementioned documentation say Memory consistency effect As concurrent collection action thread prior placing object ConcurrentLinkedDeque action subsequent access removal element ConcurrentLinkedDeque another thread
This implicit behavior somewhat pernicious aspect Java programmer without much experience take lot given
And suddenly stumble thread Java supposed production different work load pretty hard test concurrency issue
Synchronized simply mean multiple thread associated single object prevent dirty read write synchronized block used particular object
To give clarity let take example We created two MyRunnable class object shared thread thread shared thread
Now start without synchronized used PFB output suggest thread simultaneously affecting var value thread var memory
Using Synchronzied thread waiting thread complete scenario
There two lock acquired one shared thread thread another shared thread
synchronized keyword Java used make happens relationship multithreading environment avoid memory inconsistency thread interference error

In telecommunication signaling within network network synchronous signal occur clock rate clock based single reference clock
signal almost quite synchronization signal run different clock different transition rate
In communication synchronous communication requires end exchange communication respond turn without initiating new communication
A typical activity might use synchronous protocol would transmission file one point another
As transmission received response returned indicating success need resend
Each successive transmission data requires response previous transmission new one initiated

This question already answer I trying learn design pattern
us keyword I understand
I searched net found somewhat related memory I mechanical engineer understand mean
Can anybody please help understand thread keyword
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
There keyword
There one Java though method
Also I recommend learning book arbitrary website
In Java example mean one thread time able access getInstance method avoid racing condition
As commenters already pointed synchronized Java keyword
It mean method executed two thread time JVM take care enforcing
In use synchronization construct like critical section mutex
You consult
If one thread try read data thread try update data lead inconsistent state
This prevented synchronising access data

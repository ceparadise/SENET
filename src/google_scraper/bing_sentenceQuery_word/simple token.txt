In process converting sequence character computer program web page sequence token assigned thus identified meaning
A program performs lexical analysis may termed though also term first stage lexer
A lexer generally combined together analyze web page forth
A lexer form first phase modern processing
Analysis generally occurs one pas
In older language initial stage instead performed removed whitespace scannerless parser separate lexer
These step done part lexer
Lexers parser often used compiler used computer language tool
Lexing divided two stage segment input string syntactic unit called categorizes token class convert lexeme processed value
Lexers generally quite simple complexity deferred parser phase often generated notably derivative
However lexers sometimes include complexity processing make input easier simplify parser may written partly fully hand either support feature performance
A sequence character source program match pattern token identified lexical analyzer instance token
Some author term token using token interchangeably represent string tokenized token data structure resulting putting string process
The word lexeme computer science defined differently linguistics
A lexeme computer science roughly corresponds might termed linguistics term computer science different meaning linguistics although case may similar
A simply pair consisting optional
The token name category lexical unit
Common token name Consider expression programming language The lexical analysis expression yield following sequence token A token name might termed linguistics
The specification often includes set rule defines lexical syntax
The lexical syntax usually grammar rule consisting define set possible character sequence lexeme token
A lexer recognizes string kind string found lexical program take action simply producing token
Two important common lexical category
These also defined grammar processed lexer may discarded producing token considered separating two token instead
There two important exception
First language delimit indenting initial whitespace significant determines block structure generally handled lexer level see
Secondly us lexers comment whitespace must preserved example also need output comment debugging tool may provide message programmer showing original source code
In notably whitespace comment eliminated part phase initial phase separate phase eliminated handled lexer
process demarcating possibly classifying section string input character
The resulting token passed form processing
The process considered input
Note field computer security different meaning
For example text string implicitly segmented space speaker would
The raw input character must explicitly split token given space delimiter matching string regular expression
The token could represented Or When token class represents one possible lexeme lexer often save enough information reproduce original lexeme used
The parser typically retrieves information lexer store
This necessary order avoid information loss case number identifier
Tokens identified based specific rule lexer
Some method used identify token include specific sequence character termed specific separating character called explicit definition dictionary
Special character including punctuation character commonly used lexers identify token natural use written programming language
Tokens often categorized character content context within data stream
Categories defined rule lexer
Categories often involve grammar element language used data stream
Programming language often categorize token identifier operator grouping symbol
Written language commonly categorize token noun verb adjective punctuation
Categories used token either parser function program
A lexical analyzer generally nothing combination token task left
For example typical lexical analyzer recognizes parenthesis token nothing ensure matched
When lexer feed token parser representation used typically enumerated list number representation
For example Identifier represented Assignment operator Addition operator etc
Tokens defined often understood lexical analyzer generator
The lexical analyzer generated automatically tool like lex read stream character identifies stream categorizes token
This termed
If lexer find invalid token report error
Following tokenizing
From interpreted data may loaded data structure general use interpretation
The first stage usually based FSM
It encoded within information possible sequence character contained within token handle individual instance character sequence termed
For example token may contain sequence character
In many case first character used deduce kind token follows subsequent input character processed one time reaching character set character acceptable token termed rule
In language lexeme creation rule complex may involve previously read character
For example C one character enough distinguish identifier begin string literal
A however string character known certain kind string literal sequence letter
In order construct token lexical analyzer need second stage go character lexeme produce
The lexeme type combined value properly constitutes token given parser
Some token parenthesis really value evaluator function return nothing type needed
Similarly sometimes evaluator suppress lexeme entirely concealing parser useful whitespace comment
The evaluator identifier usually simple literally representing identifier may include
The evaluator may pas string deferring evaluation semantic analysis phase may perform evaluation involved different base floating point number
For simple quoted string literal evaluator need remove quote evaluator incorporates lexer unescapes escape sequence
For example source code computer program string might converted following lexical token stream whitespace suppressed special character value Though possible sometimes necessary due licensing restriction existing parser list token small write lexer hand lexers often generated automated tool
These tool generally accept regular expression describe token allowed input stream
Each regular expression associated lexical grammar programming language evaluates lexeme matching regular expression
These tool may generate source code compiled executed construct plugged template code compiling executing
Regular expression compactly represent pattern character lexeme might follow
For example language IDENTIFIER token might English alphabetic character underscore followed number instance ASCII alphanumeric character underscore
This could represented compactly string
This mean character followed
Regular expression machine generate powerful enough handle recursive pattern opening parenthesis followed statement followed closing parenthesis
They unable keep count verify side unless finite set permissible value exists
It take full parser recognize pattern full generality
A parser push parenthesis stack try pop see stack empty end see example book
Typically tokenization occurs word level
However sometimes difficult define meant word
Often tokenizer relies simple heuristic example In language use space use Latin alphabet programming language approach fairly straightforward
However even many edge case larger construct purpose may count single token
A classic example New naive tokenizer may break space even though better break arguably hyphen
Tokenization particularly difficult language written exhibit word boundary
Korean also make tokenization task complicated
Some way address difficult problem include developing complex heuristic querying table common fitting token identifies collocation later processing step
Lexers often generated analogous tool often come together
The established paired parser generator free equivalent
These generator form taking lexical specification generally regular expression markup emitting lexer
These tool yield fast development important early development get working lexer language specification may change often
Further often provide advanced feature hard program hand
However automatically generated lexer may lack flexibility thus may require manual modification written lexer
Lexer performance concern optimizing worthwhile stable language lexer run often C HTML
lexers reasonably fast improvement two three time possible using tuned generator
lexers sometimes used modern lexer generator produce faster lexers one
The family generator us approach much le efficient directly coded approach
With latter approach generator produce engine directly jump state via goto statement
Tools like proven produce engine two three time faster flex produced engine
It general difficult analyzer perform better engine generated latter tool
The following lexical analyser handle Lexical analysis mainly segment input stream character token simply grouping character piece categorizing
However lexing may significantly complex simply lexers may omit token insert added token
Omitting token notably whitespace comment common needed compiler
Less commonly added token may inserted
This done mainly group token statement block simplify parser
feature language newline normally statement terminator
Most often ending line backslash immediately followed result line following line prior line
This generally done lexer backslash newline discarded rather newline tokenized
Examples include shell script Python
Many language use semicolon statement terminator
Most often mandatory language semicolon optional many context
This mainly done lexer level lexer output semicolon token stream despite one present input character stream termed
In case semicolon part formal phrase grammar language may found input text inserted lexer
Optional semicolon terminator separator also sometimes handled parser level notably case semicolon
Semicolon insertion feature distant descendent though absent B Semicolon insertion present though rule somewhat complex avoid bug recommend always using semicolon others use initial semicolon termed start potentially ambiguous statement
Semicolon insertion language statement line continuation language statement seen complementary semicolon insertion add token even though newlines generally generate token line continuation prevents token generated even though newlines generally generate token
The block determined indenting implemented lexer increasing indenting result lexer emitting INDENT token decreasing indenting result lexer emitting DEDENT token
These token correspond opening brace closing brace language use brace block mean phrase grammar depend whether brace indenting used
This requires lexer hold state namely current indent level thus detect change indenting change thus lexical grammar depend contextual information prior indent level
Generally lexical grammar almost thus require looking back ahead backtracking allows simple clean efficient implementation
This also allows simple communication lexer parser without needing information flowing back lexer
There exception however
Simple example include semicolon insertion Go requires looking back one token concatenation consecutive string literal Python requires holding one token buffer emitting see next token another string literal rule Python requires maintaining count indent level indeed stack indent level
These example require lexical context complicate lexer somewhat invisible parser later phase
A complex example C token class sequence character determined semantic analysis phase since typedef name variable name lexically identical constitute different token class
Thus hack lexer call semantic analyzer say symbol table check sequence requires typedef name
In case information must flow back parser semantic analyzer back lexer complicates design

Tokenization act breaking sequence string piece word keywords phrase symbol element called token
Tokens individual word phrase even whole sentence
In process tokenization character like punctuation mark discarded
The token become input another process like parsing text mining
Tokenization used computer science play large part process lexical analysis
Tokenization relies mostly simple heuristic order separate token following step Tokens also separator
For example programming language identifier placed together arithmetic operator without white space
Although seems would appear single word token grammar language actually considers mathematical operator token separator even multiple token bunched together still separated via mathematical operator

I problem catch real meaning term
In term software development define generically
Does different meaning term different context language
Thanks
If google get amongst others following two definition seem applicable If combine two land somewhere near commonly meant talking token programming
Pretty vague yes used many different context
One example authentication system user log
When system authenticated user instead repeating process every request token created represents fact user authenticated
This token used subsequent request
In case fact user authenticated token represents fact
Tokens identifier keywords literal operator punctuators
But ca consider White space comment token though act separator token
One meaning term Software Development authentication signature issued server defined time interval In compiler Lexical analyzer scanner Reads input stream fuse character source text token language
sequence character collective meaning
The character sequence forming token called
Consider following assignment statement newvalue oldvalue rate The lexical analyzer generate following token

A token special frame passed node node around ring network
When get node need transmit data node change token data frame transmits recipient
A token essential inner working token ring network
The token handled single node time
The bearer token one allowed send data around network recipient node within network
The bearer token writes address recipient data sent sends next node series
When sender node sends token next node node read address
If node intended recipient sends data next node
Finally recipient node read data know recipient take data sends token back sender address message indicating data received
The token sent around ring reach token
After using token node release back network node able use
Although token ring transmission seems slow process user rarely notice data communication occurs rapidly

I want understand authentication mean
I searched internet could find anything understandable
I think well explained quoting key sentence long article The general concept behind authentication system simple
Allow user enter username password order obtain token allows fetch specific resource without using username password
Once token obtained user offer token offer access specific resource time period remote site
In word add one level indirection authentication instead authenticate username password protected resource user authenticates way within session limited duration obtains token return us token authentication session
Advantages many user could pas token obtained automated system willing trust limited time limited set resource would willing trust username password every resource allowed access forevermore least change password
If anything still unclear please edit question clarify WHAT clear I sure help
From Authentication relies signed token sent server request
What benefit using approach
cooky CORS play well across different domain
A approach allows make AJAX call server domain use HTTP header transmit user information
need keep session store token entity conveys user information
The rest state life cooky local storage client side
serve asset app CDN
javascript HTML image etc
server side API
tied particular authentication scheme
The token might generated anywhere hence API called anywhere single way authenticating call
start working native platform iOS Android Windows etc
cooky ideal consuming approach simplifies lot
since relying cooky need protect cross site request
would possible sib site generate POST request existing authentication cookie none
presenting hard perf benchmark network roundtrip
finding session database likely take time calculating validate token parsing content
A piece data could possibly created contains enough data identify particular user
You might present login information ask might present ask perform action
created using various combination various technique field cryptography well input wider field security research
If decide go create system best really smart
A token piece data created server contains information identify particular user token validity
The token contain user information well special token code user pas server every method support authentication instead passing username password directly
authentication security technique authenticates user attempt log server network secure system using security token provided server
An authentication successful user prove server valid user passing security token
The service validates security token process user request
After token validated service used establish security context client service make authorization decision audit activity successive user request
The question old technology advanced current state JSON Web Token JWT open standard RFC passing claim party web application environment
The token designed compact usable especially web browser single SSO context
It string character associated user database way
That token used authorize user access related content application
To retrieve token client side login required
After first time login need save retrieved token data like session session id everything token access resource application
Token used assure authenticity user
When register new website often sent email activate account
That email typically contains link click
Part link contains token server know token associate account
The token would usually expiry date associated may hour click link activate account
None would possible cooky session variable since unknown device browser customer using check email

type many calculation execution carried simultaneously
Large problem often divided smaller one solved time
There several different form parallel computing
Parallelism employed many year mainly interest grown lately due physical constraint preventing
As power consumption consequently heat generation computer become concern recent year parallel computing become dominant paradigm mainly form
Parallel computing closely related frequently used together often conflated though two distinct possible parallelism without concurrency concurrency without parallelism multitasking CPU
In parallel computing computational task typically broken several often many similar subtasks processed independently whose result combined afterwards upon completion
In contrast concurrent computing various process often address related task typical separate task may varied nature often require execution
Parallel computer roughly classified according level hardware support parallelism computer multiple within single machine use multiple computer work task
Specialized parallel computer architecture sometimes used alongside traditional processor accelerating specific task
In case parallelism transparent programmer parallelism explicitly particularly use concurrency difficult write sequential one concurrency introduces several new class potential common
different subtasks typically greatest obstacle getting good parallel program performance
A theoretical single program result parallelization given
Traditionally written
To solve problem constructed implemented serial stream instruction
These instruction executed one computer
Only one instruction may execute instruction finished next one executed
Parallel computing hand us multiple processing element simultaneously solve problem
This accomplished breaking problem independent part processing element execute part algorithm simultaneously others
The processing element diverse include resource single computer multiple processor several networked computer specialized hardware combination
dominant reason improvement
The runtime program equal number instruction multiplied average time per instruction
Maintaining everything else constant increasing clock frequency decrease average time take execute instruction
An increase frequency thus decrease runtime program
However power consumption chip given equation switched per clock cycle proportional number transistor whose input change processor frequency cycle per second
Increases frequency increase amount power used processor
Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately May cancellation processor generally cited end frequency scaling dominant computer architecture paradigm
empirical observation number transistor microprocessor double every month
Despite power consumption issue repeated prediction end Moore law still effect
With end frequency scaling additional transistor longer used frequency scaling used add extra hardware parallel computing
Optimally parallelization would number processing element halve runtime doubling second time halve runtime
However parallel algorithm achieve optimal speedup
Most speedup small number processing element flattens constant value large number processing element
The potential speedup algorithm parallel computing platform given Since show small part program parallelized limit overall speedup available parallelization
A program solving large mathematical engineering problem typically consist several parallelizable part several serial part
If part program account runtime get time speedup regardless many processor added
This put upper limit usefulness adding parallel execution unit
When task partitioned sequential constraint application effort effect schedule
The bearing child take nine month matter many woman assigned
Amdahl law applies case problem size fixed
In practice computing resource become available tend get used larger problem larger datasets time spent parallelizable part often grows much faster inherently serial work
In case give le pessimistic realistic assessment parallel performance Both Amdahl law Gustafson law assume running time serial part program independent number processor
Amdahl law assumes entire problem fixed size total amount work done parallel also whereas Gustafson law assumes total amount work done parallel
Understanding fundamental implementing
No program run quickly longest chain dependent calculation known since calculation depend upon prior calculation chain must executed order
However algorithm consist long chain dependent calculation usually opportunity execute independent calculation parallel
Let two program segment
Bernstein condition describe two independent executed parallel
For let input variable output variable likewise
independent satisfy Violation first condition introduces flow dependency corresponding first segment producing result used second segment
The second condition represents second segment produce variable needed first segment
The third final condition represents output dependency two segment write location result come logically last executed segment
Consider following function demonstrate several kind dependency In example instruction executed even parallel instruction instruction us result instruction
It violates condition thus introduces flow dependency
In example dependency instruction run parallel
Bernstein condition allow memory shared different process
For mean enforcing ordering access necessary
Subtasks parallel program often called
Some parallel computer architecture use smaller lightweight version thread known others use bigger version known
However thread generally accepted generic term subtasks
Threads often need update shared
The instruction two program may interleaved order
For example consider following program If instruction executed instruction executed program produce incorrect data
This known
The programmer must use provide
A lock programming language construct allows one thread take control variable prevent thread reading writing variable unlocked
The thread holding lock free execute section program requires exclusive access variable unlock data finished
Therefore guarantee correct program execution program rewritten use lock One thread successfully lock variable V thread proceed V unlocked
This guarantee correct execution program
Locks necessary ensure correct program execution greatly slow program
Locking multiple variable using lock introduces possibility program
An lock multiple variable
If lock lock
If two thread need lock two variable using lock possible one thread lock one second thread lock second variable
In case neither thread complete deadlock result
Many parallel program require subtasks
This requires use
Barriers typically implemented using software lock
One class algorithm known altogether avoids use lock barrier
However approach generally difficult implement requires correctly designed data structure
Not parallelization result
Generally task split thread thread spend portion time communicating
Eventually overhead communication dominates time spent solving problem parallelization splitting workload even thread increase rather decrease amount time required finish
This known
Applications often classified according often subtasks need synchronize communicate
An application exhibit parallelism subtasks must communicate many time per second exhibit parallelism communicate many time per second exhibit rarely never communicate
Embarrassingly parallel application considered easiest parallelize
Parallel programming language parallel computer must also known memory model
The consistency model defines rule operation occur result produced
One first consistency model model
Sequential consistency property parallel program parallel execution produce result sequential program
Specifically program sequentially consistent result execution operation processor executed sequential order operation individual processor appear sequence order specified program
common type consistency model
Software transactional memory borrows concept applies memory access
Mathematically model represented several way
introduced Carl Adam Petri doctoral thesis early attempt codify rule consistency model
Dataflow theory later built upon created physically implement idea dataflow theory
Beginning late developed permit algebraic reasoning system composed interacting component
More recent addition process calculus family added capability reasoning dynamic topology
Logics Lamport mathematical model also developed describe behavior concurrent system
created one earliest classification system parallel sequential computer program known
Flynn classified program computer whether operating using single set multiple set instruction whether instruction using single set multiple set data
The SISD classification equivalent entirely sequential program
The SIMD classification analogous operation repeatedly large data set
This commonly done application
MISD rarely used classification
While computer architecture deal devised application fit class materialized
MIMD program far common type parallel program
According Some machine hybrid category course classic model survived simple easy understand give good first approximation
It widely used scheme
From advent VLSI fabrication technology computer architecture driven doubling amount information processor manipulate per cycle
Increasing word size reduces number instruction processor must execute perform operation variable whose size greater length word
For example processor must add two processor must first add bit integer using standard addition instruction add bit using instruction lower order addition thus processor requires two instruction complete single operation processor would able complete operation single instruction
Historically microprocessor replaced microprocessor
This trend generally came end introduction processor standard computing two decade
Not early advent architecture processor become commonplace
A computer program essence stream instruction executed processor
Without parallelism processor issue le one
These processor known processor
These instruction combined group executed parallel without changing result program
This known parallelism
Advances parallelism dominated computer architecture
All modern processor
Each stage pipeline corresponds different action processor performs instruction stage processor pipeline different instruction different stage completion thus issue one instruction per clock cycle
These processor known processor
The canonical example pipelined processor processor five stage instruction fetch IF instruction decode ID execute EX memory access MEM register write back WB
The processor pipeline
Most modern processor also multiple
They usually combine feature pipelining thus issue one instruction per clock cycle
These processor known processor
Instructions grouped together
similar scoreboarding make use two common technique implementing execution parallelism
Task parallelism characteristic parallel program entirely different calculation performed either different set data
This contrast data parallelism calculation performed different set data
Task parallelism involves decomposition task allocating processor execution
The processor would execute simultaneously often cooperatively
Task parallelism usually scale size problem
Main memory parallel computer either shared processing element single processing element local address space
Distributed memory refers fact memory logically distributed often implies physically distributed well
combine two approach processing element local memory access memory processor
Accesses local memory typically faster access memory
Computer architecture element main memory accessed equal known UMA system
Typically achieved system memory physically distributed
A system property known NUMA architecture
Distributed memory system memory access
Computer system make use fast memory located close processor store temporary copy memory value nearby physical logical sense
Parallel computer system difficulty cache may store value one location possibility incorrect program execution
These computer require system keep track cached value strategically purge thus ensuring correct program execution
one common method keeping track value accessed thus purged
Designing large cache coherence system difficult problem computer architecture
As result shared memory computer architecture scale well distributed memory system
communication implemented hardware several way including via shared either multiported memory shared interconnect network myriad including fat hypercube hypercube one processor node
Parallel computer based interconnected network need kind enable passing message node directly connected
The medium used communication processor likely hierarchical large multiprocessor machine
Parallel computer roughly classified according level hardware support parallelism
This classification broadly analogous distance basic computing node
These mutually exclusive example cluster symmetric multiprocessor relatively common
A processor processor includes multiple called core chip
This processor differs processor includes multiple issue multiple instruction per clock cycle one instruction stream thread contrast processor issue multiple instruction per clock cycle multiple instruction stream
designed use prominent processor
Each core processor potentially superscalar every clock cycle core issue multiple instruction one thread
Intel best known early form
A processor capable simultaneous multithreading includes multiple execution unit processing superscalar issue multiple instruction per clock cycle thread
hand includes single execution unit processing unit issue one instruction time thread
A symmetric multiprocessor SMP computer system multiple identical processor share memory connect via bus
prevents bus architecture scaling
As result SMPs generally comprise processor
Because small size processor significant reduction requirement bus bandwidth achieved large cache symmetric multiprocessor extremely provided sufficient amount memory bandwidth exists
A distributed computer also known distributed memory multiprocessor distributed memory computer system processing element connected network
Distributed computer highly scalable
The term distributed computing lot overlap clear distinction exists
The system may characterized parallel distributed processor typical distributed system run concurrently parallel
A cluster group loosely coupled computer work together closely respect regarded single computer
Clusters composed multiple standalone machine connected network
While machine cluster symmetric difficult
The common type cluster cluster implemented multiple identical computer connected
Beowulf technology originally developed
The vast majority supercomputer cluster
Because grid computing system described easily handle embarrassingly parallel problem modern cluster typically designed handle difficult require node share intermediate result often
This requires high bandwidth importantly interconnection network
Many historic current supercomputer use customized network hardware specifically designed cluster computing Cray Gemini network
As current supercomputer use standard network hardware often
A massively parallel processor MPP single computer many networked processor
MPPs many characteristic cluster MPPs specialized interconnect network whereas cluster use commodity hardware networking
MPPs also tend larger cluster typically far processor
In MPP CPU contains memory copy operating system application
Each subsystem communicates others via interconnect
fifth fastest world according June ranking MPP
Grid computing distributed form parallel computing
It make use computer communicating work given problem
Because low bandwidth extremely high latency available Internet distributed computing typically deal problem
created example
Most grid computing application use software sits operating system application manage network resource standardize software interface
The common distributed computing middleware BOINC
Often distributed computing software make use spare cycle performing computation time computer idling
Within parallel computing specialized parallel device remain niche area interest
While tend applicable class parallel problem
use FPGA computer
An FPGA essence computer chip rewire given task
FPGAs programmed
However programming language tedious
Several vendor created language attempt emulate syntax semantics programmer familiar
The best known C HDL language
Specific subset based also used purpose
AMD decision open technology vendor become enabling technology reconfigurable computing
According Michael Chief Operating Officer first walked AMD called u stealer
Now call u partner
computing GPGPU fairly recent trend computer engineering research
GPUs heavily optimized processing
Computer graphic processing field dominated data parallel operation
In early day GPGPU program used normal graphic APIs executing program
However several new programming language platform built general purpose computation GPUs releasing programming environment respectively
Other GPU programming language include
Nvidia also released specific product computation
The technology consortium Khronos Group released specification framework writing program execute across platform consisting CPUs GPUs
others supporting
Several ASIC approach devised dealing parallel application
Because ASIC definition specific given application fully optimized application
As result given application ASIC tends outperform computer
However ASICs created
This process requires mask set extremely expensive
A mask set cost million US dollar
The smaller transistor required chip expensive mask
Meanwhile performance increase computing time described tend wipe gain one two chip generation
High initial cost tendency overtaken computing rendered ASICs unfeasible parallel computing application
However built
One example PFLOPS machine us custom ASICs simulation
A vector processor CPU computer system execute instruction large set data
Vector processor operation work linear array number vector
An example vector operation vector number
They closely related Flynn SIMD classification
computer became famous computer
However vector CPUs full computer generally disappeared
Modern include vector processing instruction SSE
created programming parallel computer
These generally divided class based assumption make underlying memory memory distributed memory shared distributed memory
Shared memory programming language communicate manipulating shared memory variable
Distributed memory us
two widely used shared memory APIs whereas MPI widely used system API
One concept used programming parallel program one part program promise deliver required datum another part program future time
also coordinating effort make HMPP directive open standard called
The OpenHMPP programming model offer syntax efficiently offload computation hardware accelerator optimize data movement hardware memory
OpenHMPP directive describe remote procedure call RPC accelerator device
GPU generally set core
The directive annotate code describe two set functionality offloading procedure denoted codelets onto remote device optimization data transfer CPU main memory accelerator memory
The rise consumer GPUs led support either graphic APIs referred dedicated APIs language extension
Automatic parallelization sequential program parallel computing
Despite decade work compiler researcher automatic parallelization limited success
Mainstream parallel programming language remain either best programmer give compiler parallelization
A fully implicit parallel programming language Parallel
As computer system grows complexity usually decrease
technique whereby computer system take snapshot record current resource allocation variable state akin information used restore program computer fail
Application checkpointing mean program restart last checkpoint rather beginning
While checkpointing provides benefit variety situation especially useful highly parallel system large number processor used
As parallel computer become larger faster becomes feasible solve problem previously took long run
Parallel computing used wide range field economics
Common type problem found parallel computing application Parallel computing also applied design particularly via system performing operation parallel
This provides case one component fail also allows automatic result differ
These method used help prevent single event upset caused transient error
Although additional measure may required embedded specialized system method provide cost effective approach achieve redundancy commercial system
The origin true MIMD parallelism go back
In April Gill Ferranti discussed parallel programming need branching waiting
Also IBM researcher discussed use parallelism numerical calculation first time
introduced computer accessed memory module
In Amdahl Slotnick published debate feasibility parallel processing American Federation Information Processing Societies Conference
It debate coined define limit due parallelism
In company introduced first Multics system symmetric multiprocessor system capable running eight processor parallel
project among first multiprocessor processor
The first multiprocessor snooping cache
SIMD parallel computer traced back
The motivation behind early SIMD computer amortize processor multiple instruction
In Slotnick proposed building massively parallel computer
His design funded earliest SIMD effort
The key design fairly high parallelism processor allowed machine work large datasets would later known
However ILLIAC IV called infamous supercomputer project one fourth completed took year cost almost four time original estimate
When finally ready run first real application outperformed existing commercial supercomputer
In early started developing came known theory view biological brain
In Minsky published claim mind formed many little agent mindless
The theory attempt explain call intelligence could product interaction part
Minsky say biggest source idea theory came work trying create machine us robotic arm video camera computer build child block
Similar model also view biological brain massively parallel computer
brain made constellation independent agent also described

The Graduate Field Computer Science seek produce researcher demonstrated breadth computer science depth specific area concentration
Although program designed flexible student CS program must complete several requirement imposed Field Cornell Graduate School Each requirement described detail followed answer common student question
Because document hope cover nuance student question concern consult advisor Director Graduate Studies DGS
The Field requirement recently updated Fall
Students matriculating Spring later must fulfill new requirement
Students matriculated program earlier may choose fulfill either new requirement
The Field belief certain area fundamental Computer Science student competent
candidate expected demonstrate competency high undergraduate level four computer science Artificial Intelligence Programming Languages Systems Theory
This requirement discharged either two way Each area required offer student least one option
Whichever method chosen requirement must fulfilled acceptable performance judged Field
For option generally mean grade higher graduate course higher undergraduate course
The acceptable course This requirement must fulfilled time A exam
student must take least five course grade credit
Note certain level course count
These course must cover least four different CS three CS
The requirement intended expose student research problem technique associated different research area also different value system various computer science research style differ evaluate validate research result
Courses taken satisfy competency requirement used count towards breadth requirement
Courses level count course field however see
The relevant course follows The relevant course following The following table summarizing breadth requirement may helpful though list definitive
Students must take five course covering four row table three column
As competency requirement breadth requirement must fulfilled acceptable performance judged Field
A grade B better generally acceptable
Students must take least two course semester first year two Cornell level making breadth requirement easy fulfill
Exceptions made upon request research advisor approval DGS first week class
The list course satisfy area research style requirement breadth requirement subject change faculty develops new course
student required satisfy project requirement writing significant piece software
One way satisfy project requirement taking course significant coding component instructor course certify project satisfied project requirement
The student typically expected get grade better course
The project requirement also satisfied project outside class example part independent research thesis research part summer job
In case chair special committee need certify satisfied project requirement
student must serve teaching assistant least two semester teach course least one semester
Contact student valuable preparation possible academic career experience communicating idea group important setting academic otherwise
We recognize Field requirement stated may universally appropriate especially nontraditional area computational biology may require significant coursework outside computer science
In exceptional case student encouraged formulate alternative course study consultation special committee present proposal Field approval
As student must residence least six semester four already hold Master degree time enrollment
The advisor DGS award one satisfactory completion semester study
Fractional unit may awarded unsatisfactory progress
Before start fourth semester must form
The special committee consists two
When specify member committee must specify area concentration represent
These must area officially recognized Graduate School associated committee member field
The Field Computer Science six official area concentration listed along associated subareas The chair special committee represents major area concentration normally thesis advisor
The chair member Field Computer Science
The area graduate student field wish minor Computer Science
It may specified either major minor area concentration student CS
The two minor member special committee represent minor subject see
While suffices three people special committee many advantage
Your committee member often provide useful advice
Being committee also mean likely know work better help want write letter reference
Note three special committee member need Cornell
The rest institution industry
The minor requirement Graduate School requirement CS Field requirement
All student Cornell must two minor
For student Computer Science Field requires one external Computer Science one internal
The external minor must field CS
The minor requirement minor field
Related field Operations Research Mathematics Cognitive Studies Electrical Computer Engineering common choice
However minor field acceptable
When choose minor field must also choose area concentration field minor advisor member field
The minor advisor serf special committee work setting minor requirement
Typically involves knowledge graduate course field expectation vary depending upon field
Before settling minor field student find field requirement
There additional requirement internal minor except minor area concentration must different major area concentration
The A exam oral exam
It final test preparedness undertaking thesis research
The content coverage A exam determined special committee discussed student beforehand
Often student describe problem attacked thesis give preliminary research result
But might instead student present survey research area
Occasionally serf opportunity present completed research unrelated thesis topic
Some committee expect student prepare written document prior exam might cover content discussed exam complement content
Students normally aim take A exam third year graduate study
Students required completed competency requirement least two unit residency prior A exam
In addition student must attempt A exam seventh semester study
More detail university requirement found
Although student normally made substantial progress towards completing breadth requirement taking A exam necessary completed requirement A exam
Note minor advisor may require taken course minor A exam check
The B exam thesis defense
It strongly recommended draft thesis provided committee three four week prior B exam
In case require minor editing exam
However B exam committee may ask revision case possible student pas B exam yet full approval thesis
The degree awarded passed B exam filed approved dissertation University completed requirement
The University requires minimum two unit residency A exam B exam
Most student complete B exam within four six year arrival Cornell
Here answer common question concern student
Again encouraged consult advisor Director Graduate Studies concern covered
There lot opportunity
Some popular option include research faculty member often advisor potential advisor particularly appropriate get along program teaching course summer internship
We believe interest spend one summer intern industry research lab University
Doing expose perspective field priority driving industry really help later enter job market
We suggest many option help find good match interest
Your advisor may also contact would lead interesting internship opportunity
For foreign student internship satisfy requirement practical training student visa hence special visa approval required
Most student spend least one two summer intern usually first three year Cornell
The Field Computer Science meet annually January
At meeting progress student examined
The DGS summarizes progress towards requirement present summary course taken grade received indicates whether student taken scheduled take A exam
For student Cornell semester emphasis discussion progress toward identifying research topic forming special committee launching research program lead dissertation
Normally student current advisor briefly describe student recent progress
The goal meeting understand best help student establish researcher publish work graduate within normal time period
If consensus emerges particular student may heading toward successful completion degree program field discus appropriate action always depends specific situation
While student occasionally asked leave program happens rarely
In case student ever asked leave program without first given warning time correct situation except case serious violation University code conduct
No
Most student extensive coursework computer science prior arrival Cornell hence situation norm exception
The field established requirement way certifying despite varied emphasis coverage undergraduate program student come graduate broadly educated
Besides need retake course need take exam
Maybe familiar enough institution transferring calibrate quality program
You negotiate transfer credit DGS advisor
No course used listed explicitly
To understand allowed general consider CS old graduate course correspond CS old CS old
CS old undergraduate operating system course spends lot time concurrency technique protecting concurrent program bug caused race condition unprotected shared variable reentrancy
It delf deeply memory management virtual memory mechanism look question protection performance general structure functionality
Although CS old CS old also system course tend specialize topic fact reason CS old system area requirement precisely course like CS old assume student broad grounding
One could earn high grade CS old without ever needing demonstrate good understanding concurrency despite fact weakness one background would real problem exploiting modern computing platform
For reason system area consider CS old acceptable substitute CS old demonstrating area proficiency
Most student enter Cornell good idea area want specialize
Those still strong area interest
By reading recent research paper annual report course description pick course taught faculty member might enjoy working
Focus area believe talent good idea interest
Being TA faculty member may want work often good idea especially course general area interest talent
Faculty member always available talk graduate student potential research topic area student talk joining research group
It common faculty member suggest working student period time perhaps semester considering relationship official
Some student approach potential advisor soon arriving campus others may take time shop around
All student try identify advisor end first year Cornell
If interest change time thing working committee chair advisor may decide reconstitute committee
This considered bad thing leave blot record
All field member interest seeing student best innovative work capable mean changing advisor topic
Most student take A exam satisfied majority field requirement many completed minor minor field requirement read rule published minor field select
The special committee typically let schedule A exam prior completion coursework although expected student finished coursework requirement three year Cornell
The competency breadth requirement relate CS field want student scholar familiar world beyond area CS
The minor requirement reflects philosophy
Note CS Field accepts proposed minor even one completely unrelated student program study
This problem
The graduate office maintains file student includes checklist various requirement
Each year prior annual review student progress occurs January graduate office update checklist
Of course think record missing pertinent information told need take course already taken let u know
I primarily interested disappointed see competency requirement emphasizes area
Why I penalized sense theory system language student would fewer requirement I
The competency requirement reflect field consensus corresponding course cover core set concept material computer scientist need familiar comfortable simply able participate normal dialogue computer scientist
We view penalty people work outside core area rather type common background provides context interacting colleague
The requirement designed flexible
Our course requirement work fewer one per semester average student
Obviously course prove interesting directly relevant others hope many student discover new area interest taking course outside narrow research focus
In case Exceptions clause make strong case requirement stated inhibit progress research chosen area study able formulate alternative program consultation advisor Field happy entertain proposal
We recognize computer science evolving rapidly
Areas considered central ten year ago may peripheral
While area competency requirement represent faculty consensus material every computer scientist know topic frequently revisit

Examples include stick ball representing molecule mathematical model planetary movement conceptual principle like ideal gas law
Because infinite variation actually found nature simplest vague model imperfect representation phenomenon
The ideal gas law excellent example model term usefulness imperfection
It state within particular volume gas particular temperature pressure number gas molecule atom exactly calculated regardless actual composition gas involved
However called ideal gas law reason
It assumes uniform condition throughout given volume gas condition almost never actually met
Bodies gas real world even within sealed container variation temperature pressure along accompanying current
Similarly equation volume sphere give good approximation volume roughly spherical object perfect sphere likely exist actual nature

Some business process modelling technique BPM suite software provides programming interface web service application program interface APIs allow enterprise application built leverage BPM engine
This component often referenced BPM suite
Programming language introduced BPM include Some language Other technology related business process modelling include
A reference model concentrating functional organizational aspect
In general model something embodies basic goal idea something looked reference various purpose
A business reference model mean describe business operation organization independent organizational structure perform
Other type business reference model also depict relationship business process business function business area business reference model
These constructed layer offer foundation analysis service component technology data performance
The familiar business reference model Business Reference Model US federal government
That model framework describing business operation federal government independent agency perform
The Business Reference Model provides organized hierarchical construct describing business operation federal government
While many model exist describing organization location map etc
model present business using functionally driven approach

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

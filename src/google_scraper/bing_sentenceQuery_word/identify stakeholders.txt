Understanding user want important
Your goal build software meet need user
There different complementary way gathering information stakeholder
Different way collecting information include survey interview direct observation
There method gathering information minimally understand
You understand method gathering requirement provides different view lens client requirement
It critical understand requirement prior building system
In addition material understand idea
A senior user Make sure talking right people system requirement
Many software project doomed fail built faulty requirement poorly understood requirement
Please consider following example answer question This simple example A small business want plan new system
The new system computer kiosk inside store allows customer sign email newsletter
If customer sign newsletter inside store get discount first purchase store
The owner hope discount incentive customer sign email newsletter
The business regularly email customer special offer saving
The business owner expects benefit system increased sale
The customer expect benefit system access special offer save money see new trendy store
Question best method collect requirement different stakeholder group
You include rationale choice
This complex example A school student want plan new system
The school hope new system secure application manages attendance data
The school administrator want carefully track attendance student student absent customizable threshold
For example school might set threshold absence within day automatically notifies student parent teacher problem attendance
The threshold might time within day something like
The system keep track attendance tardies
The system customizable attendance code
For example abscence school trip excused abscence medical abscence allowed abscence code
School administrator expect benefit data attendance support student parent school
School administrator also expect benefit giving parent student information attendance parent support child school
Finally school adinistrators expect benefit using attendance data government funding prove many student class specific day
Parents expect benefit knowing child school miss school
This way parent support child school
Being school school hope parent share
Students expect benefit understanding many day school missed
The school expects student strong ownership learning manage attendance

If I address machine machine likely follow RISC CISC design
address
address
address
To solve problem I first looked different term
When first investigating relationship RISC v CISC machine help I able quickly associate address CISC address RISC
I saw address instruction much complicated address therefore would make sense CISC design
Similar reasoning address machine RISC design
How would make distinguish CISC RISC address size middle
The problem term marketing term science engineering term
The term supposedly acronym Reduced Instruction Set Computing Complex Instruction Set Computing
Your assumption address much complicated address logic typically instruction associated RISC instruction associated CISC instruction common associated either RISC CISC
The term generally associated instruction set following characteristic Fixed width instruction
Usually
This make easier instruction decoder find boundary instruction
In CISC machine contrast different instruction range length much
This make job instruction decoder somewhat harder CISC machine result program consuming le memory
Fewer operand addressing mode
In RISC machine typically one available picture
Typically type instruction available addressing mode
The source operand found register result computation placed register
type instruction typically one operand register direct operand
type instruction typically
There typically also type instruction register indirect target sometimes instruction target operand
compared CISC instruction set
The reasoning trying keep instruction decoder simple possible RISC machine
The simple operand addressing mode easier implement simple pipeline decoder modern CISC machine often extra work instruction complex operand mode sequence like RISC instruction
There tendency RISC architecture register name available
Many RISC architecture register many CISC architecture
This making somewhat simpler exploit parallelism simple pipeline
Having available register name make possible compiler use different register name unrelated computation without requiring hardware register renaming
RISC architecture tend instruction CISC architecture tend mostly instruction
The notion also somewhat fuzzy somewhat
Every instruction operand source operand destination operand
The real distinction whether operand
In instruction make operand explicit
In instruction make destination operand explicit one source operand explicit
The third source operand always address destination operand
In instruction one source operand explicit
The source operand implicitly either accumulator register top stack destination operand
Finally instruction operand implicit usually two source operand top two value stack destination go back top stack
To sum marketing term really mean much
The important concept relationship different design choice choice make easier harder implement hardware pipeline
To understand technical aspect survive WanderingLogic said marketting aspect dominated quite quickly dichotomy need consider four point really dichotomy continuum history important RISC came reaction tentative close called
Do look simple arithmetic done give information look instruction like polynomial evaluation function entry automatic display setting register saving
Those complex instruction absent RISC present CISC
They introduced complication processor function could often implemented rapidly sequence simpler instruction especially needed full generality
RISC somewhat result ISA design trying make cost inclusion instruction justified benefit frequency execution
history important RISC became popular time implementing RISC single chip possible implementing CISC either use several chip space saving technique impact performance
You nearly define RISC answer question get high performance CPU area
When space available chip increased RISC cpu became CISCy
Now get high performance CPU small area
You ca rely cache chip lot register benefit locality data access
Thus accumulator stack architecture
Aspect carried register windowing
Pipelining
That mean overlappable instruction thus operand trouble independent instruction
Simplify decoding
Fixed width instruction
Thus wide enough operand cost implementing operand mostly instruction width get RISC operand ISA
Delayed jump le result pipelining decoding simplified extreme

The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer

In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine

In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given

Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design

Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage

However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal

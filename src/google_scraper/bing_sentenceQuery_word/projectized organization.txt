PMP Exam Preparation Study Materials Lessons Learned Contact Hours PMP FAQ etc
By In today competitive environment organization increasingly becoming improving working environment culture
They encourage employee learn experience share corporate knowledge base others benefit lesson learned
These characteristic projectized organization
A projectized organization dynamic adaptive otherwise survival difficult
In today blog post going discus projectized organization structure well benefit drawback
Okay let get started
In projectized organization organization arrange activity program portfolio implement project
Here project manager charge project full authority
Everyone team report
The projectized organization structure opposite
Here either functional manager exists limited role authority
This one main benefit projectized organized structure adaptive learn well others experience
In projectized organization resource utilized project work
Projectized organization interested project work get external client
Usually small department Admin Accounting Human Resources support project management activity
The project manager team member working
If possible member grouped together often duration project get optimum performance
As I said earlier projectized organization project manager power authority mean absolute authority everything wish
For example let say project part portfolio equipment lying idle project needed another project portfolio
In case portfolio manager simply assign equipment project requires
You may may agree decision comply
Organizations give project manager much authority power needed complete project accept responsibility outcome
The following characteristic projectized organization structure A advantage projectized organization structure follows A disadvantage projectized organization structure follows Projectized organization dynamic learn fast
In project manager main role one manages project
He given authority run project allocate resource
Although may supported PMO program manager portfolio manager end day responsible outcome project
Here post projectized organization structure end
If something add comment section
image credit Another challange projectized organization consider resource leveling
There may period project work going others
Keeping people gainfully employed entire project difficult
Or leadership ensure right people available need going employed entire time
Things get tricky team member counting snapped another employer need
Yes right
These challenge project manager deal
Dear Sir Thanks got answer blog post midterm today
Helpful material project team structure function structure matrix structure projectize structure Further disadvantage Projectized Organization Structure
Individuals commence rut project latter part get new project elsewhere

Replacement recruiting difficult latter part running project vacant position

Longer learning curve required responsibility transfer bridging knowledge gap

Functional Organizations v Projectized Organizations post Designed help preparing take PMP CAPM Certification Exam post within series present comparison common concept appear PMP CAPM exam
Your approach project management may vary based type organization working within
Organizations may structured traditional functional manner projectized structure
Depending organizational structure project management authority availability resource vary
A functional organization traditional structure organization divided based function performed particular group people Human Resources Information Technology Marketing Service etc
The resource assigned project manager usually team member within functional area title project manager
The functional manager control budget project manager act coordinator expediter project activity rather true project management responsibility
Resources project need negotiated functional manager accessibility resource based business condition
Any type escalation issue would need made functional manager
Because project manager little authority project take longer complete organizational structure generally recognized project management methodology best practice
However depth subject matter knowledge much greater resource contribute project reside within functional area
In projectized organization majority organization resource involved project work project work generally completed benefit external customer
The project manager increased independence authority member project organization project resource available project coordinator project scheduler business analyst plan administrator
The project manager authority control budget escalation issue would made sponsor potentially PMO leadership
Given project resource report project manager versus functional area may decrease subject matter expertise team member
Arizona Construction Company projectized organization majority resource allocated delivering project external customer although worker process timecard issue payroll etc
Each foreman project manager authority project resource assigned
AAJ Grocery functional organization company resource structured function perform bookkeeping stock rotation grocery personal care pharmacy dairy meat etc
There defined project organization defined project manager
The organizational structure dictate level power authority resource available project manager
A traditional functional organization give project manager little authority whereas projectized organization provide project manager significant authority

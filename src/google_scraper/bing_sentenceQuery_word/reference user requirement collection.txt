In form automatic
The attempt reclaim memory occupied longer use
Garbage collection invented around simplify manual memory management
Garbage collection often portrayed opposite requires programmer specify object deallocate return memory system
However many system use combination approach including technique
Like memory management technique garbage collection may take significant proportion total processing time program result significant influence performance
With good implementation enough memory depending application garbage collection faster manual memory management opposite also true often case past GC algorithm
Resources memory database device descriptor typically handled garbage collection
Methods used manage resource particularly may suffice manage memory well leaving need GC
Some GC system allow resource associated region memory collected cause resource reclaimed called
Finalization may introduce complication limiting usability intolerable latency disuse reclaim especially limited resource lack control performs work reclaiming
The basic principle garbage collection find data object program accessed future reclaim resource used object
Many require garbage collection either part example effectively practical implementation example formal language like said
Other language designed use manual memory management implementation available example
Some language like allow garbage collection application using separate collected manually managed object others like allow user manually delete object also entirely disable garbage collection speed required
While integrating garbage collection language enables much wider choice method GC system exist including require recompilation
GC sometimes distinguished
The garbage collector almost always closely integrated
Garbage collection free programmer manually dealing memory deallocation
As result certain category eliminated substantially reduced Some bug addressed garbage collection security implication
Typically garbage collection certain disadvantage including consuming additional resource performance impact possible stall program execution incompatibility manual resource management
Garbage collection consumes computing resource deciding memory free even though programmer may already known information
The penalty convenience annotating object lifetime manually source code lead decreased uneven performance
A paper came conclusion GC need five time memory compensate overhead perform fast explicit memory management
Interaction memory hierarchy effect make overhead intolerable circumstance hard predict detect routine testing
The impact performance also given Apple reason adopting garbage collection despite desired feature
The moment garbage actually collected unpredictable resulting stall pause memory scattered throughout session
Unpredictable stall unacceptable interactive program
Incremental concurrent garbage collector address problem varying
The modern GC implementation try minimize blocking stall much work possible background
separate thread example marking unreachable garbage instance application process continues run
In spite advancement example still difficult maintain large heap million object resident object get promoted older generation without incurring noticeable delay sometimes second
GC incompatible based management resource
As result need explicit manual resource management resource becomes transitive composition
That GC system resource object requires manual resource management object used part another object composed object also become object requires manual resource management
common type garbage collection much garbage collection often refers tracing garbage collection rather method
The overall strategy consists determining object garbage collected tracing object chain reference certain root object considering rest garbage collecting
However large number algorithm used implementation widely varying complexity performance characteristic
Reference counting garbage collection object count number reference
Garbage identified reference count zero
An object reference count incremented reference created decremented reference destroyed
When count reach zero object memory reclaimed
As manual memory management unlike tracing garbage collection reference counting guarantee object destroyed soon last reference destroyed usually access memory either CPU cache object freed directly pointed thus tends significant negative side effect CPU cache virtual memory operation
There number disadvantage reference counting generally solved mitigated sophisticated algorithm used convert thus reducing amount work needed done garbage collector
This done using analysis determine whether object allocated within function accessible outside
escape function thread
In case object may allocated directly thread stack released function return reducing potential garbage collection overhead
Generally speaking likely garbage collection standard feature
In language built garbage collection added library C
Most garbage collection built
especially notable first first language introduce garbage collection
Other dynamic language version use reference counting also tend use GC
language usually provide integrated garbage collection
Notable exception
Historically language intended beginner often used garbage collection data type string list burden programmer manual memory management
On early microcomputer limited memory slow processor BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random inexplicable pause midst program operation
Some BASIC interpreter Apple II family repeatedly scanned string descriptor string highest address order compact toward high memory resulting performance could introduce pause execution program
A replacement garbage collector Applesoft BASIC published January page identified group string every pas heap cut collection time dramatically
released provided windowing garbage collector BASIC reduced collection fraction second
While traditionally garbage collection release introduced garbage collection using developed runtime collector
However release garbage collection deprecated favor ARC introduced
Furthermore since May Apple even forbids usage garbage collection new OS X application
For garbage collection never introduced due problem application responsivity performance instead iOS us ARC
Garbage collection rarely used system perceived need tight control use limited resource
However garbage collector compatible limited environment developed
The Microsoft embedded software platform like larger cousin include garbage collection
form allowing memory reused reclaimed based invariant known compilation
This form garbage collection studied saw greater usage introduction ARC Apple ecosystem iOS OS X
Incremental concurrent garbage collector developed algorithm algorithm
In Baker algorithm allocation done either half single region memory
When becomes half full garbage collection performed move live object half remaining object implicitly deallocated
The running program check object reference correct half move across background task finding object
scheme based empirical observation object die young
In generational garbage collection two allocation region generation kept kept separate based object age
New object created young generation regularly collected generation full object still referenced older region copied next oldest generation
Occasionally full scan performed
Some include hardware support garbage collection
Most implementation garbage collector
Such garbage collector meet constraint used operating system

Reference service selecting right reference source type reference source find reference source reference source available via Web
The function library
Libraries acquire information organize information way retrieved disseminate information library acquired
Reference service fulfills last function
Reference service may vary library library library information assistance librarian available
Almost library provide reference service via telephone many library offer email text chat service reference librarian
There three main type reference assistance Reference source dictionary encyclopedia almanac atlas etc
research tool help paper project
Reference source provide answer specific question brief fact statistic technical instruction provide background information direct additional information source
In library reference source circulate located separate reference collection
This practice make reference source readily available easily accessible
Reference source designed consulted rather read
Their design generally dependent type information treatment provided
Reference material arranged alphabetically topically chronologically
Many contain cross listed information one index
If obvious reference source organized take moment look explanatory information usually presented beginning book HELP screen online product
There thousand reference source available cover practically every subject
Although term reference book frequently used reference source book serial database Internet
A large part using reference source well choosing right one
Despite wide variety available reference source categorized handful group
Think kind information need use
If unsure reference tool best suited information need reference librarian able assist
Quick guide selecting right type reference source Collins Two major category reference material general subject
General source include subject present overview topic
Reference material focused specific subject provide coverage
There reference source provide information specific subject well general source provide information many subject
In general reference source either general subject specific
If need overview subject perhaps general information source suit need
If need specialized information subject specific tool may better suited
The following reference source others available main Level Rasmuson Library via Internet
Dictionaries provide information word
Dictionaries like reference source may belong one category
For example engineering dictionary foreign language subject dictionary
Dictionaries may abridged unabridged
Abridged dictionary smaller contained commonly used word
Unabridged dictionary try include word current usage
Like reference source dictionary may become outdated language evolves
Care taken carefully identify publication date focus dictionary selected
General dictionary begin LC call number starting AG
Specialized dictionary subject specific call number
Encyclopedias provide general background information good place start researching topic know little
Large subject area discipline covered broad article explain basic concept
These overview article often contain reference specific aspect larger topic may include bibliography lead source
Encyclopedias may general subject specific
Directories provide name address affiliation etc
people organization institution
They used verify address name spelling provide contact information
As reference source directory may general focused particular subject
Biographical dictionary contain short article people life
Biography resource call number begin CT
Geographic information located gazetteer atlas map
Geography resource call number begin Sometimes atlas gazetteer combined DeLorme Mapping publishes similar product state
Almanacs contain statistic fact country event personality subject
Almanac resource call number begin AY
Handbooks manual subject area tool
Handbooks provide fact term concept movement etc
topic
Manuals provide detailed instruction particular subject something something work
These tool provide review critique person work
Historical table chronology present historical fact different format
Historical table provide fact chronologically column column representing another geographical area major area history economics religion
etc
Chronologies use narrative form present fact
Historical table chronology may span long short time period
Historical yearbook provide fact statistic single year may published annually
Indexes abstract lead additional source periodical article
Indexes provide author title subject information
Abstracts tend descriptive
Some online index database also include article
Bibliographies lead information source
They list book material provide author title publication information
Annotated bibliography also include brief description summary item
Bibliographies available almost every topic may focus specific person group subject time period
Many bibliography selective attempt include publication
Bibliographies sometimes referred Guides Literature FirstSearch NLM ANKN
The contains reference source used frequently
The Ready Reference shelf located adjacent Reference Desk
The collection includes reference tool Style guide MLA APA Chicago thesaurus Alaska phone directory Zip Code Directories etc
All material found searching library catalog
Once determine type reference source need simply subject keyword search tool
All item REF location code call number located main Reference Collection Level main floor
The Alaska Collection Level Government Documents Collection Level also Reference Collections location code AK REF DOCS REF respectively
Try dictionary bibliography
Or try field interest look reference subheading
For Example From BROWSE search library catalog type term click
Now look bibliography dictionary manual handbook etc Refer Guide Selecting Right Type Reference Source shown
Or limit field interest Or try shakespeare AND bibliography
Other option include Browse reference section
The Reference Collection Rasmuson Library near Reference Desk Level
The collection arranged starting general encyclopedia found low shelf directly behind Ready Reference Collection
The print index fill several shelf south end

Difference requirement context designing software system
Give example case
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Let elaborate
An example would A related system may The functional requirement relates system functionality
The requirement system
Typically requirement fall area A complete list available Wikipedia entry
requirement sometimes defined term metric something measured system make tangible
requirement may also describe aspect system relate execution rather evolution time
maintainability extensibility documentation etc
functional requirement main thing user expects software example application banking application application able create new account update account delete account etc
functional requirement detailed specified system design acquirement straight forward requirement system rather related usability way example banking application major requirement availability application available time possible
Functional requirement specifies function system system component must able perform
It documented various way
The common one written description document use case
Use case textual enumeration list well diagram describing user action
Each use case illustrates behavioural scenario one functional requirement
Often though analyst begin eliciting set use case analyst derive functional requirement must implemented allow user perform use case
Functional requirement system
It may A typical functional requirement contain unique name number brief summary rationale
This information used help reader understand requirement needed track requirement development system
already explained requirement
I add
requirement requirement functional requirement
This requirement specifies criterion used
requirement form overall property system whole particular aspect specific function
The system overall property commonly mark difference whether development project succeeded failed
requirement divided two main category Whether requirement expressed functional requirement may depend Ex
A system may required present user display number record database
This functional requirement
How update number need requirement
If number need updated real time system architect must ensure system capable updating displayed record count within acceptably short interval number record changing
References activity system must perform Functional requirement related technical functionality system
requirement requirement specifies criterion used judge operation system particular condition rather specific behavior
For example consider shopping site adding item cart browsing different item applying offer deal successfully placing order come functional requirement
Where performance system peak hour time taken system retrieve data DB security user data ability system handle large number user login come non functional requirement
I think client developer side regarding functionality user software developer client
requirement given client provided developer run system smoothly
safety security flexibility scalability availability etc

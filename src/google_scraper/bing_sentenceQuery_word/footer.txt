Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Why packet need frame need
I trying understand networking concept regarding OSI layering
I googled bit say footer data link layer pdu frame needed mark end pdu
But packet data etc layer need footer mark end pdu well
OSI Layer usually tasked getting information upper layer provided octet byte bit suitable sending physical link OSI Layer
On receiving side bit need converted back byte
Links usually nice property sending exact sequence
There timing consider
TTL line scan voltage time per second
shifting especially parallel line bit damage etc
Also asynchronous line one except ATM asynchronous transfer mode textbook example synchronous protocol always make smile period data transfer
This mean sender recipient somehow signal beginning end
This rather difficult frame header trailer necessarily full number block
They often include bit pattern number either followed toggle sequence followed data allows recipient synchronise sender better
Even work like receiver synchronise exact beginning minute
Going Layer switch often operate need received header containing target often source address decide send frame needing fully buffer entire frame decision leading faster throughput le latency
On hand sending side may indeed wish calculate checksum fly append trailer needed recipient side switch
This allows cost reduction hardware
A frame includes checksum calculated sender sending added trailer
Note Ethernet frame sent wire
On fly calculation CRC result better performance
The IP checksum contain IP body need calculated fly
Similarly layer logic using trailer

The term footer many us computer world
However two common document footer webpage footer
A document footer small section bottom page within document
It often used display company data information
In longer document footer may used specify current section document well
By change made footer one page change footer page section
If section defined modifying footer update page document
Most allow view edit document footer selecting
This enables edit content top page footer bottom
Some word processor like Microsoft Word allow simply within footer section edit content
If want change height footer modify margin Document Properties window
Since page number often placed bottom page generally considered part footer
However unlike footer content page number different page since automatically incremented
Additionally change made footer affect page number
The bottom section also known footer
This area typically contains name company organization publishes along relevant copyright information
Some website may also include basic navigation About Us Contact Help
Corporate website footer often include additional link Terms Use Privacy Guidelines Advertising page well
While footer required webpage found nearly major website
even includes tag designed specifically placing footer information bottom webpage
Additionally visitor often expect find certain information website bottom page web browser
Therefore web developer include footer standard part website

In term may refer one three thing The range variable given set possible value variable hold
In case integer variable definition restricted whole number range cover every number within range including maximum minimum
For example range variable integer
When array numerically indexed range upper lower bound array
Depending environment warning unpredictable behavior occur program attempt access array element outside range
In array fixed lower bound zero contain data position upper bound array element range
In others array may hole element defined therefore array range element minimum
Another meaning computer science alternative
When used sense range defined pair iterators packed together
It argued Ranges superior abstraction compared iterators several reason including better safety
In particular range supported standard library

In computing term header refer number different thing
Some common us include document header webpage header file header
Many program allow add header page
The header small area top document footer located bottom
Document header often used display document title company name top page
By header content page edit header one page update page well
If break document section specify different header section
Word processor provide different way adding editing header content
Several program allow select display header footer content
Once visible type new content inside section
Most version Microsoft Word allow simply header area activate header add edit text
If want change height header open Document Formatting window modify margin
The header webpage typically includes company organization logo well main navigation bar
This section resides top webpage often part therefore across page within website section website
even includes tag developer use specify header section webpage
A webpage header confused section HTML includes page title link referenced file
A file header small amount beginning
File header vary generally define content file list specific file attribute
For example file header image file may include image format color profile application created file
An audio file may include song name tagging format compression information
You view file header dragging file text editor reading first line
While file may contain lot garbled character header information often still readable

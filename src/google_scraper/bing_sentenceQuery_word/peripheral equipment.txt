A device connected computer part core computer architecture
The core element computer central processing unit power supply motherboard computer case contains three component
Technically speaking everything else considered peripheral device
However somewhat narrow view since various element required computer actually function hard drive memory RAM
Most people use term peripheral loosely refer device external computer case
You connect device computer expand functionality system
For example consider printer
Once printer connected computer print document
Another way look peripheral device dependent computer system
For example printer ca much become functional connected computer system
There many different peripheral device fall three general category Some device fall one category
Consider drive use read data music input use write data CD output
Peripheral device
For example printer external device connect using cable optical disc drive typically located inside computer case
Internal peripheral device also referred integrated peripheral
When people refer peripheral typically mean external one
The concept exactly therefore somewhat fluid
For desktop computer keyboard monitor considered peripheral easily connect disconnect replace needed
For laptop computer component built computer system ca easily removed
The term also mean essential function computer
Some device printer disconnected computer keep working fine
However remove monitor desktop computer becomes pretty much useless
Here see typical desktop computer system number common peripheral device
The central processing unit motherboard power supply core computer system

In storage location identified paired associated contains known unknown quantity information referred
The variable name usual way stored value addition referring variable depending context
This separation name content allows name used independently exact information represents
The identifier computer value variable may thus change course
Variables programming may directly correspond concept
The latter reference physical object storage location
The value computing variable necessarily part mathematics
Variables computer programming frequently given long name make relatively descriptive use whereas variable mathematics often terse name brevity transcription manipulation
A variable storage location may referred several different identifier situation known
Assigning value variable using one identifier change value accessed identifier
replace variable symbolic name actual location data
While variable name type location often remain fixed data stored location may changed program execution
In value generally time
In variable expression keep single value entire due requirement
In imperative language behavior exhibited named symbolic constant typically contrasted normal variable
Depending programming language variable may able store specified

Alternatively datatype may associated current value allowing single variable store anything supported programming language
An identifier referencing variable used access variable order read value alter value edit variable access permission etc
For instance variable might referenced identifier variable contain number
If variable referenced identifier well using identifier value variable altered reading value using identifier yield result
If variable referenced single identifier simply called
Otherwise speak
For instance previous example name variable question another name variable
The variable describes program text variable may used describes program execution variable meaningful value
The scope variable actually property name variable extent property variable
These confused also called property program varies point source code execution see
Further may coincide variable lifetime many case tied variable lifetime
A variable name affect
important part variable
Most language define specific variable well named entity may differ within given program
The scope variable portion program code variable name meaning variable said visible
Entrance scope typically begin variable lifetime come context exit scope typically end lifetime go context
For instance variable meaningful within certain finely within block accordingly static resolution performable
Alternatively variable resolved based global binding stack depends specific control flow
Variables accessible within certain function termed
A one indefinite scope may referred anywhere program
hand runtime aspect variable
Each variable value runtime
The extent binding portion program execution time variable continues refer value memory location
A running program may enter leave given extent many time case
Unless programming language feature variable whose extent permanently outlasts scope result whereby memory allocated variable never freed since variable would used reference deallocation purpose longer accessible
However permissible variable binding extend beyond scope occurs Lisp C execution pass back variable scope variable may used
A variable whose scope begin extent said often undefined arbitrary value accessed see since yet explicitly given particular value
A variable whose extent end scope may become deemed uninitialized since value destroyed
Variables described previous two case may said
In many language error try use value variable extent
In language may yield
Such variable may however assigned new value give new extent
For space efficiency memory space needed variable may allocated variable first used freed longer needed
A variable needed scope thus beginning variable lifetime enters scope may give space unused variable
To avoid wasting space compiler often warn programmer variable declared used
It considered good programming practice make scope variable narrow feasible different part program accidentally interact modifying variable
Doing also prevents
Common technique different section program use different make individual variable private either
Many programming language employ reserved value often named indicate invalid uninitialized variable
In language variable also meaning certain kind value stored
For example variable type prohibited storing text value
In language value variable carry type
In situation exist simultaneously A variable given type undeclared assumed universal exists compile time
Values also type checked queried runtime
Typing variable also allows resolved compile time
However different polymorphism used function call referred resolve call based value type opposed supertypes variable allowed
Variables often store simple data like integer literal string programming language allow variable store value well
Such language may also enable function
These function operate like variable represent data multiple type
For example function named may determine length list
Such function may parametric polymorphic including type variable since amount element list independent element type
The function also referred variable
For instance code segment variable named given value function called
The integer give value
In language function parameter local scope
This specific variable named referred within function though course function also variable called
The specific variable allocation representation value vary widely among programming language among implementation given language
Many language implementation allocate space whose extent last single function call whose memory automatically reclaimed function return
More generally name variable bound address particular block contiguous sequence byte memory operation variable manipulate block
common variable whose value large unknown size code compiled
Such variable reference location value instead storing value allocated pool memory called
Bound variable value
A value however abstraction idea implementation value represented stored somewhere computer memory
The program must set aside memory data object since memory finite ensure memory yielded reuse object longer needed represent variable value
Objects allocated heap must object longer needed
In language runtime environment automatically reclaims object extant variable longer refer
In language program programmer must explicitly memory later free reclaim memory
Failure lead heap depleted program run risk eventual failure exhausting available memory
When variable refers created dynamically component may indirectly accessed variable
In circumstance garbage collector analogous program feature language lack garbage collector must deal case portion memory reachable variable need reclaimed
Unlike mathematical counterpart programming variable constant commonly take name

name commonly used auxiliary variable instance variable
Some naming convention enforced language level part language syntax involve format valid identifier
In almost language variable name start digit contain whitespace character
Whether punctuation mark permitted variable name varies language language many language permit variable name forbid punctuation
In programming language specific often punctuation character known prefixed appended variable identifier indicate variable type
variable name also varies language language require use certain case naming certain entity Most modern language older language
Some language reserve certain form variable name internal use many language name beginning two underscore often fall category
However beyond basic restriction imposed language naming variable largely matter style
At level variable name used exact name chosen matter computer
Thus name variable identify rest tool programmer make program easier write understand
Using poorly chosen variable name make code difficult review name name clear often encouraged
Programmers often create adhere code style guideline offer guidance naming variable impose precise naming scheme
Shorter name faster type le descriptive longer name often make program easier read purpose variable easier understand
However extreme verbosity variable name also lead le comprehensible code

I know scalar mean exactly I trying see I thinking correctly
Does scalar relate arbitrariness type data could type system able know data advance
The term scalar come used differentiate single number vector matrix
The meaning computing similar
It distinguishes single value like integer float data structure like array
This distinction prominent Perl sigil resembles used denote scalar variable sigil resembles denotes array
It anything type element
It could number character string object
What matter called scalar
A Scalar simply
For purpose discussion let assume scalar rather collection number
For example result SQL query return value first column first row result set returned query
It typically used retrieve aggregate value COUNT AVERAGE ID new record number record processed query
A supplemental mnemonic Karl Bielefeldt great answer A simple way thinking scale
An integer scale
A integer scale

A real number scale
A character boolean decimal scale
Even string scale use sorting
Hence scalar
A database row scale
A complex number scale
An object representing email message scale
An array vector matrix scale
A scalar simple single numeric value etc
usually integer fixed point float single double opposed array structure object complex vector real plus imaginary magnitude plus angle component higher dimensional vector matrix etc
data type contains one single numeric value
However note large complex data type sort also flattened represented byte computer memory also represented one single binary scalar number
Turing used technique represent entire computer program one scalar number
As case many term computing origin word relates physical property
The term Scalar relatively old computing
Its definition le strict day
When store data computer memory data either fit one address
When called scalar called composite
Mainly CPUs could handle one data byte time
As stated Karl Bielefeldt term indeed taken algebra
We call string string string char
A char scalar string composite
Storing piece data datum multiple address blurred line somewhat
Think like When CPU could process datum one instruction scalar
These day scalar singular value singular value may defined differently amongst different language
integer float char string booleans enums considered scalar day
Arrays list tree object etc

I say byte keep thing clear technically I talking day bit commonly used punch card example later magnetic strip Disclaimer I unable find reference internet I got information school old book amongst I think Mathematical Tables Aids Computation
That said memory used anyone deny answer would nice
The word scalar derives Latin word scalaris adjectival form scala Latin ladder
The English word scale also come scala
A Scalar variable hold individual value
For example Say trying represent name various student set variable
Each individual variable scalar variable follow SQL scalar function return single value based input value

I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

submitted Hi
I final tomorrow I little confused I hoping guy could explain something
We learning implementing method professor wrote pas parameter name get resulting semantics
If actual parameter scalar value pas reference
If actual parameter constant expression pas value
If actual parameter array index element bound text I looked around google lot I still hard time understanding scalar value constant expression
If anyone could explain context I would ever grateful
Thanks much
Post comment
So integer variable scalar value
This mean integer inside want
Scalar generally mean number dimension like number line
As want tell someone Go look value really tell find value
Think way
You box
That box hold one integer
This box variable value
You put box away closet box
If wanted show someone box could tell someone else may changed box
You may remember last time opened box long time ago
So instead tell It box
They go box find box look inside see value
Box reference
Constants one value ever
Every time look something hold constant value never change
You kind think constant like value single point
If need tell someone value PI instance need box put PI
PI always
It never never change aside rounding issue etc
So someone say Hey PI
tell
You need go check box need worry changed
So pas value directly
Note More one type variable scalar integer
It used example
As mathematician I never heard scalar defined one dimensional good definition
Really
Is scalar field R known isomorphic vector space R
C C In category vector space field morphisms linear transformation ever refer vector space There thing resides category field
If I mistaken terminology map given corresponding fibration

Feel free correct
I think sound interesting I understand saying
Could dumb
Basically two thing isomorphic algebraically pretty much
So take matrix example
When add two matrix add respective term
But notice pretty much thing adding two vector
Thus set matrix set vector said respect addition
So guy saying vector space like R C much scalar field R C respectively
Yes R refers real number
pi C refers complex number pi
R space vector containing single real number C space vector containing single complex number
Is scalar matrix considered one dimensional
No individual scalar value
Matrices inherently value contain may
At least I think
But like saying coordinate actually since isolated component coordinate scalar real number
Be aware raw number considered dimensionless unit dimension context though
No distinction constant scalar math though right
The key variability
A scalar field value change according function
A constant literally constant like g You beat I calculus speak constant integration constant fit definition scalar variable
Thank
This confirms I thinking
I REALLY appreciate help
Thank
Thank You
Thank
A scalar value number like integer pointer float
In C elementary type scalar structs array
structs array union corner case could define scalar
A constant expression something constant never varies
Typically mean computable compile time usually definition restricted slightly expression made constant expression
For example always constant expression unless x
Every combination possible
I think scalar something something else multiply
That simply number
This distinguishes scalar say vector matrix generally simply scale whatever multiplied
scalar time vector vector scaled scalar time matrix matrix scaled
constant expression programming value change
It scalar
Understood way somewhat vague use term scalar talking passing value passing reference
You could pas scalar either value reference
I guess array thought vector scalar denote single value think somewhat sloppy
Is char considered scalar
A bool
In Java char bools passed way ints double value
But make sense call scalar imo
Your story make cry computer science education today
I ca help answer professor sound confused
I could tell constant expression mean experience completely irrelevant passing name unlikely helpful
It might help elaborate question since mechanic parameter passing even meaning word used
depends language using
I would suggest I ca help answer professor sound confused
I could tell constant expression mean experience completely irrelevant passing name unlikely helpful
Yeah sound like someone mixed distinction distinction
Could probably save lot trouble clearing first
The class called Concepts Programming Languages
There single language talking language general
What I said word word wrote board
The book elaborate example
I googled definition read quite bit still help
Specifically I talking passing parameter main program subprogram
Passing name mean actual parameter textually substituted corresponding formal parameter occurrence subprogram
The thing I think scalar value variable like could take integer float value ie
changed constant variable actual numerical value changed ie

But I sure make sense
I think I understand professor referring case I think correct understanding
As example let say language programming
When function called using form The argument method function call constant expression
There meaning argument
Its value never change
So value passed
If method call follows know value know something coming way
So reference value passed value
Edit I upvotes leveled
Since I getting downvoted people I curious reason
I know I expressed answer term mathematical nomenclature seeing I mathematician let alone computer scientist I tried help understanding best way I could
I lurk I pick info I thought I could maybe contribute
One language explicitly us term constant expression
In generalized whatever determined compile time I believe marked const
If method call follows int know value know something coming way
So reference value passed value
Not necessarily
It possible passed also possible passed
Depends defined supposed
If take reference change content contains different value call possible value passed
I seen professor define scalar type anything class array
It pretty bad actually
One word
That mean assign new value
If eft hand side assignment example variable item array
Otherwise ight hand side assignment
Your case case passing passed reference
That mean parameter alias original different name variable
Changes parameter imply change variable
Your case case passing
It modifiable assignment modification parameter either ignored parameter change thrown away visible inside subroutine invisible outside cause exception

A scalar variable scalar field variable hold one value time
It single component assumes range number string value
A scalar value associated every point space
In computing term scalar derived scalar processor process one data item time
In C programming language scalar data type char int float commonly used
However scalar data type also may scalar variable basic variable used practical extraction report language
They either string include symbol letter number exponent integer decimal value
Scalar also common concept mathematics physic
In mathematics scalar used vector component well module normed vector space
In physic scalar function give single variable value point space measure temperature charge variation etc
It physical quantity changed rotation translation coordinate system

I always considered string scalar main reason programming treat string value lot like primitive value
But Wikipedia definition far I understand speak scalar nature string
In programming often seen opposite string usually counted scalar well primitive type natural ordering thus compared tested equality mean language opposed would usually require custom logic operation
By I mean firstly opposite I want know whether scalar real property string calling scalar programming behavior resembles primitive type This leaf question string text scalar value point view theoretical computer science
I used hearing word scalar used physic linear algebra theoretical computer science
In context interested distinguish scalar v vector element R v element R
The word invented help u talk distinction
However distinction seem particularly relevant
I heard word scalar used much theoretical computer science
To extent invented meaning scalar theoretical computer science I probably reserve value stored O space basic operation value performed O time
For instance would qualify
If definition mind qualify item operation ca done constant time
So I think scalar object particularly well defined
What I think scalar primitive type ca broken object type composite type built one type
A string inherently scalar treated depends much choice programming language
On one end Haskell literally synonym string list character
In sense primitive type definitely NOT scalar
C similar string pointer array string object clearly scalar since well object
However language like Java JavaScript distinguish string list character
However main reason efficiency
They make string primitive type weird stuff internally interning case string stored one place memory comparing easy checking pointer equality
I would argue implementation detail anything
Usually sort isomorphism String sequence Char operation like getting nth character string
If way string linked collection character making
Likewise fact express string literal necessarily make scalar
In Haskell syntactic sugar
linked list character

A element used define
A quantity described multiple scalar direction magnitude called
In real number element field called relate vector vector space operation vector multiplied number produce another vector
More generally vector space may defined using instead real number
Then scalar vector space element associated field
A operation confused may defined vector space allowing two vector multiplied produce scalar
A vector space equipped scalar product called
The real component also called
The term also sometimes used informally mean vector usually compound value actually reduced single component
Thus example product matrix matrix formally matrix often said
The term used denote matrix form scalar
The word derives word adjectival form Latin ladder
The English word also come
The first recorded usage word scalar mathematics occurs According citation first recorded usage term scalar English came referring real part A defined set vector set scalar operation take scalar vector another vector
For example scalar multiplication yield
In linear function
The scalar taken field including real complex number well
According fundamental theorem linear algebra every vector space
It follows every vector space scalar field coordinate element
For example every real vector space isomorphic real space
Alternatively vector space equipped function assigns every vector scalar
By definition multiplying scalar also multiplies norm
If interpreted operation described length
A vector space equipped norm called
The norm usually defined element scalar field restricts latter field support notion sign
Moreover dimension must closed square root well four arithmetic operation thus rational number excluded acceptable
For reason every scalar product space normed vector space
When requirement set scalar form field relaxed need form example division scalar need defined scalar need resulting general algebraic structure called
In case scalar may complicated object
For instance ring vector product space made module matrix entry scalar
Another example come space form module real function manifold
The scalar multiplication vector space module special case kind
Operations apply single value time

How I calculate scalar curvature object
Maybe tennis ball
I quite new stuff
And I problem understanding thing I believe maybe complex Like I looked I calculate scalar curvature one question said calculate scalar curvature local chart I tried reading find answer
I wish I could understand everything even maybe know little I took Intermediate Algebra even though I got I really quite passion mathematics
I going taking next week
I want ask question like like calculate
Thank much
I know going asking I thought could take leave It curvature scalar Ricci tensor
We find surface sphere tennis ball good sphere
The Ricci tensor calculated Riemann tensor turn depends Christoffel symbol need first
easiest find geodesic equation
I hope know bit General Relativity least Differential Geometry
aj x j aj ij x j x formally equivalent x ij x j x The metric sphere r constant radius sphere We two equation arising
For Comparing get dividing For Dividing comparing get remember second term All Christoffel symbol zero
In Riemann tensor one independent component take calculated mj j mj k k j k km Lowering first index k k k We find Ricci tensor
ij ab aibj Since metric diagonal ab inverse ab using symmetry Riemann tensor ab ab We get upstairs version Ricci tensor well j ij The curvature scalar R ij ij As would expect curvature sphere decrease radius get larger

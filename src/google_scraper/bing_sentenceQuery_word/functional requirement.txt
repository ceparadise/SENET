This information used help reader understand requirement needed track requirement development system
already explained requirement
I add
requirement requirement functional requirement
This requirement specifies criterion used
requirement form overall property system whole particular aspect specific function
The system overall property commonly mark difference whether development project succeeded failed
requirement divided two main category Whether requirement expressed functional requirement may depend Ex
A system may required present user display number record database
This functional requirement
How update number need requirement
If number need updated real time system architect must ensure system capable updating displayed record count within acceptably short interval number record changing
References activity system must perform Functional requirement related technical functionality system
requirement requirement specifies criterion used judge operation system particular condition rather specific behavior
For example consider shopping site adding item cart browsing different item applying offer deal successfully placing order come functional requirement
Where performance system peak hour time taken system retrieve data DB security user data ability system handle large number user login come non functional requirement
I think client developer side regarding functionality user software developer client
requirement given client provided developer run system smoothly
safety security flexibility scalability availability etc

Want watch later
We use various product every day
Our house full
We use cleaning product tidy mess use clothing product preserve modesty heading work use electronic product listen music watch TV
But ever wondered product came
How went idea someone head item use touch
Well easy take several formalized step
The first gather requirement
A written description characteristic capability new upgraded product design must incorporate
They often quite detailed describe must provided provided
In word exclude implementation detail
Requirements document appear legally binding language used specific
In particular requirement must provided includes word shall
For example If requirement might provided word used may
For example A requirement describes operation activity
For example Note requirement describe HOW activity done WHAT done
Similarly think everyday product say pen functional requirement might indicate casing green
Another might indicate button extends stylus case
A requirement describes measure whether functional requirement met
For example This one little trickier describing operation
Rather describing metric used determine performance operation described
If think back pen example requirement might button allow minimum stylus extension
Get FREE access day create account
You would find functional requirement
This description characteristic capability specific product service typically provide
It form basis interaction consumer product service usually customer could internal department like Sales Marketing provider product service vendor
It generated either party
In instance generated
The customer creates high level overview document vendor derives detailed version overview
Once party agree content work begin
Any company develops product use requirement document
Dell us computer product sell Apple us phone build Kraft Heinz us bottle sell ketchup
Some small page describe thing like pen talked earlier
Others thousand page like Ford GM describe vehicle drive
A written description ability product service provide
A requirement describe product service
A requirement requirement describes whether functional requirement met
Both type requirement appear describe entire operation product service

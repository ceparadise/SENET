Mathematics play key role computer science researcher would consider computer nothing physical embodiment mathematical system
And whether designing digital circuit computer program new programming language need mathematics able reason design correctness robustness dependability
This book cover foundational mathematics necessary course computer science
The common approach presenting mathematical concept operator define term property satisfy based definition develop way computing result applying operator prove correct
This book mainly written computer science student author take different approach start defining way calculating result applying operator prof satisfy various property
After justifying underlying approach author offer detailed chapter covering propositional logic predicate calculus set relation discrete structure structured type number reasoning program

It mean talking whole number accurately thing counted
So part discrete mathematics
The go
How
Well exist talking discrete mathematics
They simply ignored
This actually make math much easier
Say want add everything exists
In mathematics opposite discrete calculation would go like In discrete mathematics equivalent calculation would go like So see latter much simpler
You add number
Graphically would amount continuous sum area red line discrete sum area blue line
Another continuous function sine wave may look like discrete function square wave might look like I tell math behind last one lot simpler
In world computer information stored bit unit information take value either
like nature something take value well
Instead everything binary
Since bit building block everything happens computer software everything becomes discrete
For instance hard drive laptop using right store bit information
Not exactly number
You half bit
The study algorithm also firmly discrete world
An algorithm list instruction computer make computer program possible
When determining much time algorithm need run count number operation need perform
Notice word
Again discrete mathematics

The actor model adopts philosophy
This similar philosophy used
An actor computational entity response message receives concurrently There assumed sequence action could carried parallel
Decoupling sender communication sent fundamental advance Actor model enabling control structure pattern
Recipients message identified address sometimes called mailing address
Thus actor communicate actor whose address
It obtain message receives address actor created
The actor model characterized inherent concurrency computation within among actor dynamic creation actor inclusion actor address message interaction direct asynchronous restriction message arrival order
Over year several different formal system developed permit reasoning system actor model
These include There also formalism fully faithful actor model formalize guaranteed delivery message including following See The Actor model used framework modeling understanding reasoning wide range
For example The actor model semantics
Arguably first concurrent program
During course normal operation computer needed able receive information outside character keyboard packet network
So information arrived execution computer interrupted special code called interrupt handler called put information could subsequently retrieved
In early interrupt began used simulate concurrent execution several program single processor
Having concurrency gave rise problem
Originally problem conceived one single computer
developed later developed solve mutual exclusion problem
However neither solution provided construct encapsulated access shared resource
This encapsulation later accomplished Hewitt Atkinson Atkinson
The first model computation Post production based mathematics made use global state represent computational later generalized McCarthy Hayes Dijkstra see
Each computational step one global state computation next global state
The global state approach continued machine machine including version
Such nondeterministic automaton property machine always halt started initial state bound number state halt
developed nondeterministic global state approach
Dijkstra model gave rise controversy concerning also called property amount delay servicing request become unbounded result arbitration contention shared resource
Hewitt argued actor model provide guarantee service
In Dijkstra model although could unbounded amount time execution sequential instruction computer parallel program started well defined state could terminate bounded number state Dijkstra
Consequently model could provide guarantee service
Dijkstra argued impossible implement unbounded nondeterminism
Hewitt argued otherwise bound placed long take computational circuit called settle see
Arbiters used computer deal circumstance computer clock operate asynchronously respect input outside keyboard input disk access network input So could take unbounded time message sent computer received meantime computer could traverse unbounded number state
The actor model feature unbounded nondeterminism captured mathematical model using
There global state actor model
Messages actor model necessarily buffered
This sharp break previous approach model concurrent computation
The lack buffering caused great deal misunderstanding time development actor model still controversial issue
Some researcher argued message buffered ether environment
Also message actor model simply sent like requirement synchronous handshake recipient
A natural development actor model allow address message
Influenced Hewitt proposed development new model concurrent computation communication would required field could empty
Of course sender communication desired recipient access address recipient already address would sent communication
For example Actor might need send message recipient Actor later expects receive response response actually handled third Actor component configured receive handle response example different Actor implementing
The original Actor could accomplish sending communication includes message wish send along address third Actor handle response
This third Actor handle response called sometimes also called
When recipient Actor ready send response sends response message Actor address included original communication
So ability Actors create new Actors exchange communication along ability include address Actors message give Actors ability create participate arbitrarily variable topological relationship one another much object Simula language may also relationally composed variable topology object
As opposed previous approach based composing sequential process actor model developed inherently concurrent model
In actor model sequentiality special case derived concurrent computation explained
Hewitt argued adding requirement message must arrive order sent Actor
If output message ordering desired modeled queue Actor provides functionality
Such queue Actor would queue message arrived could retrieved order
So Actor sent message Actor later sent another message requirement arrives
In respect actor model mirror system guarantee packet must received order sent
Not providing order delivery guarantee allows packet switching buffer packet use multiple path send packet resend damaged packet provide optimization
For example Actors allowed pipeline processing message
What mean course processing message Actor designate behavior used process next message fact begin processing another message finished processing
Just Actor allowed pipeline processing message mean pipeline processing
Whether message pipelined engineering tradeoff
How would external observer know whether processing message Actor pipelined
There ambiguity definition Actor created possibility pipelining
Of course possible perform pipeline optimization incorrectly implementation case unexpected behavior may occur
Another important characteristic actor model locality
Locality mean processing message Actor send message address receives message address already received message address Actors creates processing message
But see
Also locality mean simultaneous change multiple location
In way differs model concurrency model token simultaneously removed multiple location placed location
The idea composing Actor system larger one important aspect developed Gul Agha doctoral dissertation developed later Gul Agha Ian Mason Scott Smith
A key innovation introduction specified mathematical function express Actor process message including specifying new behavior process next message arrives
Behaviors provided mechanism mathematically model sharing concurrency
Behaviors also freed actor model implementation detail token stream interpreter
However critical understand efficient implementation system described actor model require optimization
See detail
Other concurrency system modeled actor model using
There actor model system closed sense receive communication outside
The mathematical denotation denoted closed system constructed initial behavior function
These obtain increasingly better approximation construct denotation meaning follows Hewitt Clinger In way mathematically characterized term possible behavior including involving unbounded nondeterminism
Although implementation used prove generalization thesis Kleene A consequence theorem finite Actor nondeterministically respond number different output
One key motivation development actor model understand deal control structure issue arose development
Once actor model initially defined important challenge understand power model relative thesis computation subsumed deduction
Hewitt argued Kowalski thesis turned false concurrent computation actor model see
Nevertheless attempt made extend concurrent computation
However Hewitt Agha claimed resulting system deductive following sense computational step concurrent logic programming system follow deductively previous step see
Recently logic programming integrated actor model way maintains logical semantics
Migration actor model ability Actors change location
dissertation Aki Yonezawa modeled post office customer Actors could enter change location within operating exit
An Actor migrate modeled location Actor change Actor migrates
However faithfulness modeling controversial subject research
The security Actors protected following way A delicate point actor model ability synthesize address Actor
In case security used prevent synthesis address see
However Actor address simply bit string clearly synthesized although may difficult even infeasible guess address Actor bit string long enough
us address endpoint Actor reached
Since character string clearly synthesized although encryption make virtually impossible guess
Synthesizing address Actors usually modeled using mapping
The idea use Actor system perform mapping actual Actor address
For example computer memory structure computer modeled Actor system mapping
In case address modeling rest mapping
initial published work concurrency also notable based composing sequential process
His work differed actor model based fixed number process fixed topology communicating number string using synchronous communication
The original CSP model published differed actor model based parallel composition fixed number sequential process connected fixed topology communicating using synchronous based process name see
Later version CSP abandoned communication based process name favor anonymous communication via channel approach also used Milner work
These early model Milner Hoare property bounded nondeterminism
Modern theoretical CSP Hoare Roscoe explicitly provides unbounded nondeterminism
extension coloured Petri net like actor based asynchronous message passing unbounded nondeterminism like early CSP define fixed topology elementary processing step transition message repository place
The actor model influential theory development practical software development
The actor model influenced development subsequent
In Turing lecture Robin Milner wrote The actor model extensive influence commercial practice
For example Twitter used actor scalability
Also Microsoft used actor model development Asynchronous Agents Library
There numerous Actor library listed Actor Libraries Frameworks section
According Hewitt Actor model address issue computer communication architecture including following Many idea introduced actor model also finding application reason Hewitt
The key difference agent system definition impose extra constraint upon Actors typically requiring make use commitment goal
The actor model also applied client
There growing community researcher working actor model becoming commercially important
Early Actor researcher included A number different programming language employ actor model variation
These language include Actor library framework also implemented permit programming language actor
Among framework Please note framework library listed

LIKES What Actor model In computer science
year month ago Latest activity This question answer

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I read bit actor model really understand use actor real world situation model problem
Can someone please explain
A simple example link example would much appreciated
Actors sense modeling action message etc way modeling software provides couple useful item
Actors live single thread allowing operation happen without bunch locking magic
An actor respond message inbox
When want process command send message take care order received
Just like normal queue
Thread safe killer I use number open source project I work
In language Scala example easy turn actor based code single process distributed system breaking apart actor turning channel communicate remote channel
This change implementation easy awesome feature
Helps focus Task Based event rather CRUD event
CRUD simple like interacting filing cabinet
If provide value software produce
Tying multiple action single Update command task based system useful saving DB
This also get stuff like CQRS
solid
When start talking concurrency trying solve resource problem
Concurrency thread lock pretty easy wrong
The actor model help force program concurrent portion code self contained nugget performed parallel without depending another piece code
You trying avoid nastiness like race condition deadlock
Actors like I conversation
You ca reach brain pick I typing
You passed message saying Why exist
I sat crunched number sent reply I think therefore I
You could tell I slice planet Earth contact message pas back forth
EDIT You say language comfortable see actor implementation language
Maybe simplest would actor libs python
But probably better learning would Erlang
The language little rough get nuance good language
Actors element use case diagram represent external entity user external system etc
act system

Over year several different formal system developed permit reasoning system Actor model
These include There also formalism fully faithful Actor model formalize guaranteed delivery message including following See The Actors model used framework modelling understanding reasoning wide range
For example The Actor model build previous model computation
The viewed earliest see Hewitt Bishop Steiger
For example lambda expression implement tree data structure supplied parameter
When tree given parameter message return likewise given message return
However semantics lambda calculus expressed using value parameter substituted body invoked lambda expression
The substitution model unsuitable concurrency allow capability changing resource
Inspired lambda calculus programming language made use data structure called environment value parameter substituted body invoked lambda expression
This allowed sharing updating shared data structure provide concurrency
pioneered using message passing computation motivated discrete event simulation application
These application become large unmodular previous simulation language
At time step large central program would go update state simulation object changed depending state whichever simulation object interacted step
developed idea first described IFIP workshop would update local state based message object
In addition introduced object
Their innovation considerably improved modularity program
However Simula used control structure instead true concurrency
influenced message passing invocation developing
Hewitt intrigued put complexity communication included invocation many field including In Kay visited MIT discussed idea building work little person model computation used teaching child program
However message passing quite complex
Code language viewed interpreter simply stream token
As later described Thus message passing model closely tied particular machine model programming language syntax lend concurrency
Also although system bootstrapped language construct formally defined object respond message see discussion led believe new mathematical model concurrent computation based message passing simpler
Subsequent version Smalltalk language largely followed path using virtual Simula message passing structure program
However made primitive integer floating point number
The author Simula considered making primitive object refrained largely efficiency reason
first used expedient primitive object version integer floating point number The programming language later version Java starting Java adopted le elegant solution using variant used earlier implementation
The Smalltalk system went become influential innovating bitmap display personal computing class browser interface many way
For detail see Kay
Meanwhile Actor effort MIT remained focused developing science engineering higher level concurrency
See paper Briot idea developed later incorporate kind Actor concurrency later version Smalltalk
Prior development Actor model widely used model nondeterministic computation
However widely acknowledged important limitation modeled control flow data flow
Consequently readily composable thereby limiting modularity
Hewitt pointed another difficulty Petri net simultaneous action
atomic step computation Petri net transition token disappear input place transition appear output place
The physical basis using primitive kind simultaneity seemed questionable
Despite apparent difficulty Petri net continue popular approach modelling concurrency still subject active research
Prior Actor model concurrency defined low level machine term
It certainly case implementation Actor model typically make use hardware capability
However reason model could implemented directly hardware without exposing hardware thread lock
Also necessary relationship number Actors thread lock might involved computation
Implementations Actor model free make use thread lock way compatible law Actors

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In question let TM Turing machine NTM nondeterministic Turing machine PTM probabilistic Turing machine
In paper Actor Model Computation Scalable Robust Information Systems Carl Hewitt proposes following hypothesis All physically possible computation directly implemented using Actors
He comment hypothesis update thesis physically computable function implemented using lambda calculus TM stating It consequence Actor Model computation implemented lambda calculus
Then recall Plotkin informal proof NTM property bounded nondeterminism Now set initial segment execution sequence given nondeterministic program P starting given state form tree
The branching point correspond choice point program
Since always finitely many alternative choice point branching factor tree always finite
That tree finitary
Now lemma say every branch finitary tree finite tree
In present case mean every execution sequence P terminates finitely many execution sequence
So output set P infinite must contain nonterminating computation
Then present algorithm Actor Model semantics seem property unbound nondeterminism stating later prof hypothesis
The algorithm computation integer value
For NTM stated way Step Either print next square tape execute Step
Step Execute Step
Step Halt It property NTM halt finite number state bounded nonndeterminism shown Plotkin may never halt whatsoever subtree computation infinite depth
For Actor Model stated like Since Actor Model semantics state message guaranteed delivered restriction delivered actor halt infinite possible state unbounded nondeterminism however halt always
However really seem imply hypothesis stated seems highly unlikely actually achieve Actor Model semantics real hardware
I like propose following question Does property unbounded nondeterminism really something computational power
Is unbounded integer algorithm really impossible implement TM
If class computation requires
Edsger Dijkstra argued impossible implement system unbounded nondeterminism Tony Hoare agreed implementation try reasonably fair
Is level fairness achievable today good enough say actually computation require property implemented physical hardware
If add entropy source NTM PTM form fair random number generator achieve unbounded nondeterminism property Actor Model

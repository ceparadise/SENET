In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

The growing demand student around world UK qualification evidence UK university offer high level technical skill knowledge
Recent international comparison ranked teaching research UK university among best qualification comparison body NARIC rank UK qualification highest quality band worldwide
Yet many employer complain graduate taught skill want many large employer admit recruiting elite Russell Group university
How picture compare rest world
The USA also report increasing demand coupled skill shortage IT sector repeated across EU Canada Australia
By contrast much developing world employer willing invest qualification staff one reason significant demand UK postgraduate degree amongst international student
So many recent UK computer science graduate unemployed
Input based recent report commissioned investigated data produced Higher Education Statistics Agency HESA cite number interrelated factor affecting unemployment
Some factor obvious quality degree obtained location within UK institution study one key factor employment rate black minority ethnic BME student
Computer science forefront widening access agenda far higher proportion BME student studying traditional science engineering subject
This also influence balance student number university Russell Group institution BME student opposed Russell Group university BME
BME graduate higher unemployment rate across subject even BME computer science student Russell Group institution unemployment rate compared average Russell Group unemployment rate
However need clear many student come still live area extremely high unemployment figure would heralded significant success story
It argued consideration graduate employment need contextualised contemporary rather making unrealistic comparison institution draw significantly different demographic
Having said considerable bias employment prospect graduate BME origin similar better qualification white counterpart even resulted graduate changing obtain interview
Most employer looking graduate two three year work experience past graduate recruitment scheme would take new graduate train workplace
These scheme largely vanished employer arguing investment wasted graduate swiftly move
There also many report suggest offshoring graduate IT work short term strategy employer strangling pipeline necessary develop experienced IT professional
Recent change school curriculum introduced teaching computer science GCSE emphasis coding reap significant benefit
Ensuring school pupil strong technical understanding computer science ability program develop computer system mean employer educator much stronger pool talent draw upon
In turn enable evolution training education meet future need IT industry
This positive development come nothing however address contributing factor result current high level computer science graduate unemployment
So
Two clear message emerge research
Firstly employment prospect BME graduate need tackled national level
Only parity treatment employer enable benefit widening access higher education particular success computer science attracting student diverse community
Secondly employer need incentivised reintroduce graduate training scheme stop offshoring graduate job provide employment prospect new graduate rebuild pool talent experience UK IT industry
These issue tackled locally nationally must tackled UK lose current position knowledge economy

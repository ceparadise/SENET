The command word short phrase abbreviation character
Early personal computer often used command driven interface
Systems Microsoft Disc Operating System used command instead graphical user interface let user point click icon mouse
Command driven interface eventually fell favor beginner often find tricky use
Users must remember specific command interface challenging
Although commonly used operating system many programmer computer professional prefer use command driven interface
They often much faster graphical user interface use much le processing power
Professionals experienced user cut menu perform function immediately
The system easier access executing complex action
Users still access command line interface graphic user interface operating system
Windows operating system include application called Command Prompt allows user access command driven interface Windows
Mac user use Terminal access system command line function perform advanced task
The Terminal found Utilities folder Applications

The term command driven refers program software application take specific word letter command performing task
These program use interface devoid graphical component user interface element found type interface user interface
program efficient difficult learn use
Many early computing system operating system system even today many programmer still use compiler interface owing efficiency
system application program simple interface accepts textual command input user performs corresponding task
The textual command entered user may whole word abbreviation single character
These system avoid need navigation various menu layer found system hence quicker type user interface
Novice user may find difficult make use system memorize various unique command prescribed syntax required carry particular task
These system however often used computer professional since command allow direct access OS function eliminate heavy process involved graphical user interface
Some application include Microsoft Disk Operating System command prompt installed Windows system Unix shell certain SQL query interpreter
Most interface consist black screen single title bar top scroll bar blinking cursor
Although graphical interface become popular way user interaction user also make use application like Command Prompt Windows Terminals Mac accessing system command line function performing advanced task

A interface list menu choice user select navigate one place another within website software program
A interface part graphical user interface distinct advantage disadvantage
ATMs kiosk often use interface ease use
A interface differs greatly interface
interface provide graphical menu interface require user type particular action command line
A interface require user memorize command make navigation easier user
As user require little training using interface
interface also require little computer processing power quickly loaded device
A disadvantage interface difficult user find command know command located menu
This particularly true complex system include multiple menu
Another disadvantage interface command buried within multiple menu difficult find
When happens user click multiple menu complete single command

The
The command processor program operating system command
The shell therefore part command processor accepts command
After verifying command valid shell sends another part command processor executed
system offer choice several different shell popular Each offer somewhat different
The phrase shell also used describe outermost layer
In use another term
sometimes provide alternative shell make interaction program easier
For example application usually shell might translates selection appropriate

operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Î¤his sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

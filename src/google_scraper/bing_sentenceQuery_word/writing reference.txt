In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

First bit writing style
Strunk White The Elements Style great starting point CS writer
Yes prescriptive
But need know rule even small rule capitalize put comma
When deviate rule draw reader attention
Be sure intentional receiving attention idea writing
This advice specific English CS writing
For insightful essay good writing English differs language I recommend Zinnser essay
A thorough resource Knuth Larrabee Roberts book
A brief pointer common mistake given
For example The experiment required implement wrong The experiment required user implement fine The experiment required implementation Also The experiment involves implement wrong The experiment involves implementing correct
In contrast I managed implement correct I managed implementing
Some useful link google gerund infinitive
See

The purpose document summarize view academic writing Computer Science
Comments welcome rlaz
For interested detailed advice including structure paper use math pseudo code figure effectively I recommend consulting
As aside example excellent essay writing Computer Science topic see particularly early work
Writing clearly allows increase amount information reader take within fixed let face usually short amount time
Some main issue address following Generally good academic writing one aim use secondary reference possible avoids ternary document cite secondary reference distant document altogether
The reason avoid ternary distant reference people general bad keeping core document content use etc
consider happens gossip analogy
web dynamic file move regularly URLs hard read contain little information source also see section Bibliographic Formats
Another reason avoid URLs web page unlike academic paper conference Computer Science web page usually many written persuade inform
With current rate publication often impossible cite literature subject
Choosing reference include discussion requires balance frequently cited paper often primary reference present key idea technique along paper
Any reference contribute main discussion paper omitted Do aim maximize number citation paper
In essence locating reference define support paper complex search problem skill take great deal practice people develop
Make sure read paper abstract skim paper deciding read detail make search efficient
While permitted quote source directly using offset indented block paragraph generally academic writing word
If paraphrasing someone else word explaining
another paper provide relevant citation end sentence
Another option provide citation section text indicate concept came example As example copying pasting section document including one without explicitly citing source
using number type plagiarism
One frustration computing research lack standard biliographic format professional organization
IEEE ACM SPIE often even individual conference use different citation bibliographic entry style
Fortunately use LaTeX create paper publication venue often provide bibtex file automate citation bibliography style
Make use bibliography database program easily collect select organize annotate reference
Most modern system allow save entry even file useful feature
There many system organizing paper database short list system I know include
Personally I find paper I write I need copy entry bibtex bibliography database separate file different style use different field
Further I find formatting amount information provided database online differs dramatically always editing bibliography entry needed
Carefully editing bibliography sign respect importantly reader need accurate complete information choose find quickly scan reference cited paper
Note using URL reference unacceptable proper paper citation available
If must use URL accompany link name author document document title date web page

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is citation style within computer science field
By citation style I referring three general method Browsing show roughly split option occasional
So I really two question The answer may I imagine something like Everyone us even though clearly easier read
Regarding Both ACM IEEE use citation style safe say reader academic article CS familiar style
Therefore use style paper look similar conference journal article CS
Regarding experience citation style Smith effective reader
This opinion shaped department Computational Social Science I read mix paper CS Statistics Social Science Economics others
My reason favoring make easier read paper line
Having read many paper given field I familiar cited seminal work
If I see Padgett Powell I immediately know reference I guess
But I see tell nothing
I go look reference list memorize stand Padgett Powell every time I see
But nature discipline nature paper lead difference role citation serve text
In Social Sciences general citation structural discourse field
Citations often mark school thought line argument research lens
In contrast Computer Science citation much utilitarian function point paper provide theoretical foundation attempted approach problem solved
In way intellectual bill material research behind CS paper
The numbered reference sufficient giving anyone pointer bill material need
Another justification citation style shorten page count paper
In opinion le le justified era people read paper electronically print
A computer science paper go either IEEE ACM use one standard citation style feel like computer science paper many reader

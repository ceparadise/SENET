Software Testing Complete Guide Posted In We tester aware various type Software Testing Functional Testing Testing Automation Testing Testing etc
Each u would come across several type testing testing journey
We might heard might worked everyone knowledge testing type
Each type testing feature advantage disadvantage well
However article I covered mostly every type software testing usually use day day testing life
Let go look
What You Will Learn It common type testing used software industry
The objective testing identify possible issue defect releasing market user
Alpha testing carried end software development phase Beta Testing
Still minor design change may made result testing
conducted developer site
virtual user environment created type testing
An acceptance test performed client verifies whether end end flow system per business requirement per need end user
Client accepts software feature functionality work expected
It last phase testing software go production
This also called User Acceptance Testing UAT
The name suggests testing performed basis
reference test case also without plan documentation place type testing
The objective testing find defect break application executing flow application random functionality
testing informal way finding defect performed anyone project
It difficult identify defect without test case sometimes possible defect found testing might identified using existing test case
The aim determine whether software application accessible disabled people
Here disability mean deaf color blind mentally disabled blind old age disabled group
Various check performed font size visually disabled color contrast color blindness etc
It formal type software testing carried customer
It performed releasing product market actual end user
Beta testing carried ensure major failure software product satisfies business requirement perspective
Beta testing successful customer accepts software
Usually testing typically done others
It final testing done releasing application commercial Beta version software product released limited certain number user specific area
So end user actually us software share feedback company
Company take necessary action releasing software worldwide
Whenever input data entered application store database testing database known
There different database like SQL Server MySQL Oracle etc
Database testing involves testing table structure schema stored procedure data structure
In testing GUI involved tester directly connected database proper access tester easily verify data running query database
There issue identified like data loss deadlock data corruption etc testing issue critical fixing system go live production environment It subtype Compatibility Testing explained performed testing team
Browser Compatibility Testing performed web application ensures software run combination different browser operating system
This type testing also validates whether web application run version browser
It type testing validates whether newly developed software updated software work well older version environment
Backward Compatibility Testing check whether new version software work properly file format created older version software also work well data table data file data structure created older version software
If software updated work well top previous version software
Internal system design considered type testing
Tests based requirement functionality
Detailed information advantage disadvantage type Black box testing seen
This type testing check behavior application boundary level
Testing performed checking defect exist boundary value
Boundary value testing used testing different range number
There upper lower boundary range testing performed boundary value
If testing requires test range number Boundary Value Testing performed value
It type white box testing carried unit testing
Branch Testing name suggests code tested thoroughly traversing every branch
Comparison product strength weakness previous version similar product termed Comparison Testing
It testing type validates software behaves run different environment web server hardware network environment
ensures software run different configuration different database different browser version
Compatibility testing performed testing team
It mostly performed developer completion unit testing
Component Testing involves testing multiple functionality single code objective identify defect exists connecting multiple functionality
Similar system testing involves testing complete application environment situation mimic use interacting database using network communication interacting hardware application system appropriate
It testing technique type Black Box Testing
During equivalence partitioning set group selected value number picked testing
It understood value group generate output
The aim testing remove within specific group generates output defect
Suppose application accepts value using equivalence partitioning value picked testing zero one positive value one negative value
So Equivalence Partitioning testing
It mean testing
Example testing includes scenario also involves scenario based experience tester
Exploratory Testing informal testing performed testing team
The objective testing explore application looking defect exist application
Sometimes may happen testing major defect discovered even cause system failure
During exploratory testing advisable keep track flow tested activity start specific flow
performed without documentation test case
This type testing ignores internal part focus output check per requirement
It type testing geared functional requirement application
For detailed information Functional Testing click
The objective GUI testing validate GUI per business requirement
The expected GUI application mentioned Detailed Design Document GUI mockup screen
The GUI testing includes size button input field present screen alignment text table content table
It also validates menu application selecting different menu menu item validates page fluctuate alignment remains hovering mouse menu
Gorilla Testing testing type performed tester sometimes developer well
In Gorilla Testing one module functionality module tested thoroughly heavily
The objective testing check robustness application
The objective Happy Path Testing test application successfully positive flow
It look negative error condition
The focus valid positive input application generates expected output
This approach testing continuous testing application new functionality added
Application functionality module independent enough test separately
This done programmer tester
Testing done full partial upgrade process different operating system different hardware software environment termed
Testing integrated module verify combined functionality integration termed
Modules typically code module individual application client server application network etc
This type testing especially relevant distributed system
It type testing objective Load testing check much load maximum workload system handle without performance degradation
Load testing help find maximum capacity system specific load issue cause software performance degradation
Load testing performed using tool like LoadRunner WebLoad Silk performer etc
Monkey testing carried tester assuming monkey us application random input value entered Monkey without knowledge understanding application
The objective Monkey Testing check application system get crashed providing random input
Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary Monkey Testing performed randomly test case scripted necessary aware full functionality system
Mutation Testing type white box testing source code one program changed verifies whether existing test case identify defect system
The change program source code minimal impact entire application specific area impact related test case able identify error system
Testers mindset attitude break using negative testing validate system application break
performed using incorrect data invalid data input
It validates system throw error invalid input behaves expected
It type testing every organization separate team usually called Test NFT team Performance team
NFT testing involves testing requirement Load Testing Stress Testing Security Volume Recovery Testing etc
The objective NFT testing ensure whether response time software application quick enough per business requirement
It take much time load page system sustain peak load
This term often used interchangeably stress load testing
done check whether system meet performance requirement
Different performance load tool used testing
It type testing validates well application system recovers crash disaster
Recovery testing determines system able continue operation disaster
Assume application receiving data network cable suddenly network cable unplugged
Sometime later plug network cable system start receiving data lost connection due network cable unplugged
Testing application whole modification module functionality termed Regression Testing
It difficult cover system typically used type testing
In Risk Based Testing functionality requirement tested based priority
testing includes testing highly critical functionality highest impact business probability failure high
The priority decision based business need priority set functionality high priority functionality test case executed first followed medium low priority functionality
The low priority functionality may tested tested based available time
The testing carried insufficient time available test entire software software need implemented time without delay
This approach followed discussion approval client senior management organization
Sanity Testing done determine new software version performing well enough accept major testing effort
If application crashing initial use system stable enough testing
Hence build application assigned fix
It type testing performed special team tester
A system penetrated hacking way
done check software application website secure internal external threat
This testing includes much software secure malicious program virus secure strong authorization authentication process
It also check software behaves hacker attack malicious program software maintained data security hacker attack
Whenever new build provided development team software testing team validates build ensures major issue exists
The testing team ensures build stable detailed level testing carried
check show stopper defect exists build prevent testing team test application detail
If tester find major critical functionality broken initial stage testing team reject build inform accordingly development team
Smoke Testing carried detailed level functional regression testing
Static Testing type testing executed without code
The execution performed documentation testing phase
It involves review walkthrough inspection deliverable project
Static testing execute code instead code syntax naming convention checked
The also applicable test case test plan design document
It necessary perform static testing testing team defect identified type testing project perspective
This testing done system stressed beyond specification order check fails
This performed heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity complex database query continuous input system database load
Under entire system tested per requirement
It type testing based overall requirement specification cover combined part system
Testing individual software component module termed Unit Testing
It typically done programmer tester requires detailed knowledge internal program design code
It may also require developing test driver module test harness
Under testing check done
Application flow tested know new user understand application easily Proper help documented user get stuck point
Basically system navigation checked testing
The testing involves identifying weakness software hardware network known Vulnerability Testing
Malicious program hacker take control system vulnerable kind attack virus worm
So necessary check system undergo Vulnerability Testing production
It may identify critical defect flaw security
It type testing performed performance testing team
The software application undergoes huge amount data Volume Testing check system behavior response time application system came across high volume data
This high volume data may impact system performance speed processing time
This testing based knowledge internal logic application code
It also known Glass box Testing
Internal software code working known performing type testing
Under test based coverage code statement branch path condition etc
For information white box testing type please click
The testing type part testing
However still list type testing testing type used type project
So I covered common Types Software Testing mostly used testing life cycle
Also alternative definition process used different organization basic concept everywhere
These testing type process implementation method keep changing project requirement scope change
valuable information type testing Thanks Namita Actually I planning detail description type later thought big mess single post
I take one type time future posting
usefull software tester student alpha testing beta testing sequrity usefull thanking u I need sample general checklist detailed checklist need create control chart
It really good

THIS INFERMATION IS
I NEED FULL INFERMATION ABOUT MERCURY QUALITY U SEND IT

The information provided u really helping
Can u give information java testing
hai This reply answer
Typically know basic knowledge testing mean knowledge enough kind software testing
difference functional testing systemtesting Naga Vishala In case developer might ask bug reporter detail bug make status bug Need Info Thilak The answer NO
Think development If theoretical knowledge programming language say write program using language
No must knowledge
If basic knowledge software testing enough testing type
You gain knowledge type using basic knowledge
chengaiah Functional testing black box testing without considering program structure
You verify program using specification document
System testing end end application testing includes whole application one unit generally tested usability functionality performance load

hello friend Can tell specifide result project testing
Folks Lot people asking difference Smoke Sanity testing
And info get confused people becoming
Let make simple Difference Smoke Sanity Smoke testing done verify build tested done properly
The build new updated version software
The motive check application build working fine crash
For example say application following feature say feature page case feature page Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Smoke Test Check page displayed properly broken link page
Check button page clickable disabled hidden
Check traverse back forth page
Check see help section page legal disclaimer section page outgoing link page Check look feel page font user text box displayed properly broken image cluttered text font scramble optional check unless see something unreadable Check able enter info input box need transaction check whether able input text page
Note required transaction Smoke test
In word testing functionality application application build
Sanity Testing done verify whether new updated build functioning properly
Note difference smoke check application build sanity check build functionality higher level
Take example say application following feature Login Logout Enter info delete info update info Change address search record retire record print form generate report Here Sanity Test Check customer critical functionality working performing least one transaction major feature
Your depth sanity testing depends functionality application
Say major feature application
So need perform one transaction feature verify major feature working properly
Sanity test concentrate testing major feature
A feature said major accessed customer frequently daily working important business
Now say login logout enter info delete info generate record main feature application
Sanity test Check able login Check able logout Check able enter info save record new user
Check able delete data existing user
Check generate report current date
You need test rest feature
Nor require run exhaustive test case major feature
Note check basic functioning major feature working
Don run end end multiple operation test case sanity
Just ran Basic test case feature designed
Hope everyone got clear understanding Smoke Sanity testing
And Difference Well

Test planning ass software application risk develops plan determine software minimizes risk Testers must understand development method environment effectively plan testing The tester must understand new increased risk order evaluate control computer application The test plan focused identified risk An Ideal Test Plan comprise Test Scope Test Objective Assumptions Risk Analysis Test Design Roles Responsibilities Test Schedule Resources Test Data Management Test Environment Communication Approach Test Tools Vijay In article End End testing explained wrong
The name give exact definition
Say Example ATM transaction End End testing test performed inserting card get cash reciept card
That mean entire functioniality application input output know End To End Testing
Cheers george ya completely agree George
System Testing called end end testing scratch application entire functionality application every part application checked ita proper functionality
In actual testing final phase testing entire application tested functionality prior User Acceptance Testing
Hi back
This time info System testing people seem
You may asked question interview System testing
What difference Functional System Testing
Functional Testing Everyone know I going explain keep short test functionality software product functional testing
All feature transaction checked functional The common type testing
System Testing Like must read comment End End type testing
mean
You test software right login till
Test everything system testing
M kidding
Then system
It mean check system
Check functionally well Check functionality functional testing
Check requirement like Usability Accessibility Compatibility Localization Performance I recall rest In short supposed test everything kind testing System testing
That called One liner definition system testing To make simple system testing check functional well requirement software
Functional requirement affect product directly like feature whereas requirement affect product like page load time compatibility different browser user friendliness localization
So important check requirement well
Hope everyone clear Lets make Cheers Sameer K meant database testing
done real time

I heard need perform I wanted know wtelse thing mentioned happen db hai Plz one tell difference stress load testing example Hi All Here difference see SMOKE TESTING Smoke testing originated hardware testing practice turning new piece hardware first time considering success catch fire smoke
In software industry smoke testing shallow wide approach whereby area application without getting deep tested
A smoke test using written set test automated test A Smoke test designed touch every part application cursory way
It shallow wide
Smoke testing conducted ensure whether crucial function program work bothering finer detail
Such build verification
Smoke testing normal health check build application taking testing depth
SANITY TESTING A sanity test narrow regression test focus one area functionality
Sanity testing usually narrow deep
A sanity test usually unscripted
A Sanity test used determine small section application still working minor change
Sanity testing cursory testing performed whenever cursory testing sufficient prove application functioning according specification
This level testing subset regression testing
sanity testing verify whether requirement met checking feature

mentioned Regression Testing given Below What Regression Testing
Introduction This article attempt take close look process technique Regression Testing
What Regression Testing
If piece Software modified reason testing need done ensure work specified negatively impacted functionality offered previously
This known Regression Testing
Regression Testing attempt verify That application work specified even made The original functionality continues work specified even software application The software application introduced new bug When Regression Testing necessary
Regression Testing play important role Scenario change made previously tested software code
Regression Testing hence important aspect various Software Methodologies software change enhancement occur frequently
Any Software Development Project invariably faced request changing Design code feature
Some Development Methodologies embrace change
For example Extreme Programming Methodology advocate applying small incremental change system based end user feedback
Each change implies Regression Testing need done ensure System meet Project Goals
Why Regression Testing important
Any Software change cause existing functionality break
Changes Software component could impact dependent Components
It commonly observed Software fix could cause bug
All affect quality reliability system
Hence Regression Testing since aim verify important
Making Regression Testing Cost Effective Every time change occurs one following scenario may occur More Functionality may added system More complexity may added system New bug may introduced New vulnerability may introduced system System may tend become fragile change After change new functionality may tested along original functionality
With change Regression Testing could become costly
To make Regression Testing Cost Effective yet ensure good coverage one following technique may applied Test Automation If Test case automated test case may executed using script change introduced system
The execution test case way help eliminate oversight human error
It may also result faster cheaper execution Test case
However cost involved building script
Selective Testing Some Teams choose execute test case selectively
They execute Test Cases Regression Testing
They test decide relevant
This help reduce Testing Time Effort
Regression Testing What Test
Since Regression Testing tends verify software application change made everything may impacted change tested Regression Testing
Generally following area covered Regression Testing Any functionality addressed change Original Functionality system Performance System change introduced Regression Testing How Test
Like Testing Regression Testing Needs proper planning
For Effective Regression Testing done following ingredient necessary Create Regression Test Plan Test Plan identified Focus Areas Strategy Test Entry Exit Criteria
It also outline Testing Prerequisites Responsibilities etc
Create Test Cases Test Cases cover necessary area important
They describe Test Steps needed test Inputs Expected Outputs
Test Cases used Regression Testing specifically cover functionality addressed change component affected change
The Regression Test case may also include testing performance component application change done
Defect Tracking As Testing Levels Types It important Defects tracked systematically otherwise undermines Testing Effort
Thanks Suresh Hi Yamini This Suresh Working Test Engineer
mentioned Test Strategy given Below Test strategy hope brief version test case Test strategy company level document say approch test strategy doc also say scope business issue test delivarables tool used risk analysis etc

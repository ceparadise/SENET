Branch Address Modification Using The micro program Figure show branch always made single branch address
This direct consequence combining simple micro routine sharing common part
Consider point labeled figure
At point necessary choose action required direct indirect addressing mode
If indirect mode specified instruction microinstruction location performed fetch operand memory
If direct mode specified fetch must bypassed branching immediately location
The efficient way bypass microinstruction preceding branch microinstructions specify address use OR gate change leastsignificant bit address direct addressing mode involved
This known technique modifying branch address
An alternative approach use two conditional branch microinstructions allocation
Another possibility include two next address field within branch microinstruction one direct one indirect address mode
Both alternative inferior technique
Addressing Figure includes wide branch microinstruction location
The instruction decoder abbreviated InstDec figure generates starting address micro routine implement instruction loaded IR
In example register IR contains Add instruction instruction decoder generates microinstruction address
However address loaded micro program counter
The source operand Add instruction specified several addressing mode
The figure show five possible branch Add instruction may follow
From left right indexed auto decrement auto increment register direct register indirect addressing mode
The technique described used point modify starting address generated instruction decoder reach appropriate path
For address shown figure change address one five possible address value depending addressing mode used instruction
USE OF WMFC We assumed possible issue wait MFC command branch microinstruction
This done microinstruction location example cause branch microinstruction location
Combining two operation introduces subtle problem
The WMFC signal mean microinstruction may take several clock cycle complete
If branch allowed happen first clock cycle microinstruction location would fetched executed prematurely
To avoid problem branch must take place memory transfer progress completed WMFC signal must inhibit change content micro program counter waiting period
Let u examine one path flowchart Figure detail
Consider case source operand accessed auto increment mode
This path needed execute instruction Add Rsrc Rdst Rsrc Rdst register machine
Figure show complete micro routine fetching executing instruction
We assume instruction field used specify addressing mode source operand shown
Bit pattern located bit denote indexed auto decrement auto increment register mode respectively
For mode bit used specify indirect version
For example mode field specifies direct version auto increment mode whereas specifies indirect version
We also assume processor register used addressing purpose specified using code
Thus source operand fully specified using mode field register indicated bit
The destination operand register specified bit
Since register may involved determining source destination operand location microinstructions refer respective control signal Rsrcout Rsrcin Rdstout Rdstin
These signal must translated specific register transfer signal decoding circuitry connected Rsrc Rdst address field IR
This mean two stage decoding
First microinstruction field must decoded determine Rsrc Rdst register involved
The decoded output used gate content Rsrc Rdst field IR second decoder produce gating signal actual register
The micro program Figure derived combining possible value mode field resulting structure requires many branch point
The example Figure two branch point two branch microinstructions required
In case expression bracket indicates branch address loaded μPC address modified using scheme
Consider microinstruction location example
Its unmodified version cause branch microinstruction location cause another fetch main memory corresponding indirect addressing mode
For direct addressing mode fetch bypassed ORing inverse indirect bit src address field bit IR bit position μPC
Another example use bit ORing microinstruction location
There five starting address micro routine implement Add instruction question depending address mode specified source operand
These address differ middle octal digit
Hence required branch implemented using bit ORing modify middle octal digit pattern obtained form instruction decoder
The bit ORed digit supplied decoding circuitry connected src address mode filed bit IR
Microinstruction address chosen make modification easy implement bit μPC set directly bit IR
This suffices select appropriate macroinstruction src address mode except one
The register indirect mode covered setting bit μPC
equal register indirect special case indirect mode use microinstruction Microinstructions Field The microprogram Figure requires several branch microinstructions
These microinstructions perform useful operation datapath needed determine address next microinstruction
Thus detract operating speed computer
The situation become significantly worse microroutines considered
The increase branch microinstructions stem partly limitation ability assign successive address microinstructions generally executed consecutive order
This problem prompt u reevaluate sequencing technique built around incrementable μPC
A powerful alternative include address field part every microinstruction indicate location next microinstruction fetched
This mean effect every microinstruction becomes branch microinstruction addition function
The flexibility approach come expense additional bit address field
The severity penalty assessed follows In typical computer possible design complete microprogram fewer microinstructions employing perhaps bit per microinstruction
This implies address field bit required
Therefore approximately control store capacity would devoted addressing
Even extensive microprograms needed address field would slightly larger
The obvious advantage approach separate branch microinstructions virtually eliminated
Furthermore limitation assigning address microinstructions
These advantage offset negative attribute make scheme attractive
Since instruction contains address next instruction need counter keep track sequential address
Hence μPC replaced microinstruction address register μAR loaded field microinstruction
A new control structure incorporates feature support shown Figure
The next address bit fed OR gate μAR mat address modified basis data IR external input condition code
The decoding circuit generate starting address given microroutine basis OP code IR
Let u reconsider example Figure using microprogrammed control structure Figure
We need several control signal included microinstruction format Figure
Instead referring register explicitly use name Rsrc Rdst decoded actual control signal data src dst field IR
Branching ORing technique requires include appropriate command microinstructions
In flowchart Figure needed microinstruction determine address next microinstruction based addressing mode source operand
The addressing mode indicated bit instruction register shown Figure
Let signal ORmode control whether used
In microinstructions used decide indirect addressing source operand used
We use signal ORindsrc purpose
For simplicity use separate bit microinstructions denote signal
One bit microinstruction used indicate output instruction decoder gated μAR
Finally microinstruction contains field hold address next microinstructions
Figure show complete format microinstructions
This format expansion format figure Using microinstructions implement micro routine figure As shown figure
The revised routine one le microinstruction
The branch microinstruction location combined microinstruction immediately preceding
When microinstruction sequencing controlled μPC End signal used reset μPC point starting address microinstruction fetch next machine instruction executed
In example starting address
How ever micro routine figure terminate producing End signal
In organization starting address specified resetting mechanism triggered End signal instead specified explicitly FO field
It show control signal decoded microinstruction field used control sequencing
Detailed circuitry shown Figure
Perfecting Microinstructions One drawback control lead slower operating speed time take fetch microinstructions control store
Faster operation achieved next microinstruction current one executed
In way execution time overlapped fetch time
microinstructions present organizational difficulty
Sometimes status flag result currently executed microinstruction needed determine address next microinstruction
Thus straightforward occasionally wrong microinstruction
In case fetch must repeated correct address requires complex hardware
However disadvantage minor technique often used

automatic transformation instruction program executed digital computer programming procedure organization group operation ordering data allocation memory cell
Instruction modification make possible performance large number calculation program relatively small number instruction instruction transformed used various purpose processing data various location computer memory composing new instruction
Instruction modification made either software example using control element operator panel
Any part instruction may changed depending nature change distinction made among address substitution changing operation code changing indicator
The address part instruction frequently altered instruction address changed cell internal memory computer control unit
In second case instruction memory cell remain unchanged address increased decreased control unit instruction executed
During compilation program instruction set mean utility program code prepared advance computed running program
In case necessary give instruction original form need may occur address substitution memory cell instruction modification called restoration code
Instruction modification facilitates programming reduces length program effect saving number memory device increase output computer

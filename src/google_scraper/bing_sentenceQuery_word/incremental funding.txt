This article slightly updated version note I posted almost two year ago personal blog
At recent Microsoft Software Summit Paris I gave short talk based note many people told enjoyed I thought would appropriate share idea reader CACM blog many presumably interested issue research funding
Please note enthusiastic text extract funding agency appearing meant read aloud proper accent passion
The world research funding late prey new craze
We fund ten visionary hope one invent relativity
The rest
Petty functionary
Slaves toiling incremental research
ashamed even asking
Take US National Science Foundation description funding Computer Systems Research The European Research Council left behind Frontiers
Breakthrough
Rise
Aim high
Creativity
Risk
Impact
Pass adjective bottle

Unconventional
Highly ambitious
Major

Pioneering
Galileo Pasteur please others need apply
As everyone know including people write call balderdash
First research precise statistic derived research funding continuation would welcome incremental
Second breakthrough happen remaining often planned breakthrough
Incremental research glorious I supply adjective mode science
Beginning PhD student forgiven believing myth lone genius penetrates secret time space thinking aloud long walk Italian best friend stage shared delightful delusion
But every researcher presumably including go lead research agency quickly grows learns thing happen
You read someone else solution problem improve
Any history science tell every teenager getting hit falling apple intuits structure universe hundred excellent scientist look state art decide trifle better
Here still recent example particularly telling account scientist
It would much exaggeration characterize entire field program proving past four decade long series variation Tony Hoare Axiomatic Semantics paper
Here Hoare recollection Turing Award lecture Had research submitted funding imagine reaction And yet Floyd core concept right Hoare paper reworked extended form make practical semantic specification proof possible
Incremental research best
The people charge research program NSF ERC scientist know
How come publish absurd pronouncement
There two reason
One typical academic fascination industry model
Having heard venture capitalist routinely fund ten project expect one succeed want transpose model science funding hence emphasis risk
But transposition doubtful venture capitalist ass ward time soon decide venture going break cut funding overnight often causing company go
This happen world science project certainly project supposed break new ground get funded minimum three five year
If project peter find spending money
The second reason sincere desire avoid mediocrity
Here sympathize funding executive seen many proposal
The last time I ECOOP seemed every paper bringing little twist programming
This kind research benefit one understandable research funders want people innovate
But telling submitter every project epochal surprisingly missing adjective description I sure soon corrected achieve result
It achieves something else good neither research research funding promise inflation
Being told Darwin nothing researcher learn game promise moon also get part risk emphasize uncertain whole thing high likelihood fail
Indeed since work let car run water seamlessly extracted ambient air excedent produce afternoon tea
By mostly entertainment one belief hyped promise
The real harm however honest scientist work normal way proposing bring important contribution solution important problem
They risk dismissed vision
Some funding agency kept head cool
How refreshing quote read general description funding Swiss National Science Foundation In word say say
Quality originality methodology track record
Will research
We find done
I convinced agency come sens stop nonsense
One reason hope excess currently fashionable style
The short text European Research Council includes count nineteen way saying proposal must daring
Now need expert structural text analysis know someone find necessary state idea nineteen time single paragraph feel fundamentally insecure
He truth trying convince
At point people charge realize hype breed breakthrough breed hype
In meantime
Most u need funding
Also nothing wrong little hype
After shy unassuming type convinced smarter everyone else become researcher pick profession modest OK maybe politician
Being demure hurt
I still remember project proposal many year ago came back glowing review topic important idea right team competent
The agency officer verdict reject
The proposer certain succeed research
There however line crossed
Highlighting extrapolating benefit proposed research OK making absurd representation
So one cheer incremental research
Wait phrase supposed cheer
All right let go incrementally
One cheer incremental research

Swiss National Science Foundation
Disclosure The SNSF kindly funded several research project past year
Forster Edward Arnold
Im sorry IMHO confuse computer science science
Natural science investigates rule govern natural world social science study human behaviour
Computer science however invention
We invent architecture programming language build system build system build better system But acquire knowledge explains world allows prediction world
No
Thus computer science raison per se
IMO computer science academia engineering belt brace
Engineering conventional stuff incrementally advancing state art something industry often well
Doing risky thing basic research project likely fail seldom done company
This gap filled publicly funded research
I however almost agree Long Live Incremental Research Natural Social Science
I writing comment reference comment posted June stating computer science confused science
The pursuit understanding computational theory cognition behavior well within realm computer science also intrinsically related pure mathematics biochemistry even particle physic certain level
This one example come mind trying think computer science science engineering I sure others
Anyone think computer science natural science never heard theoretical computer science mathematics heart computer science
To commentator June Even true area computer science like engineering point
Are saying none engineering science computer engineering mechanical engineering electrical engineering get funding
Besides industry never risky engineering research
Gabriel
Despite rhetoric vast majority research funded NSF good solid incremental science
However budget constraint success rate range might want give NSF benefit doubt research judged peer review breaking new ground get little higher priority funding compared work review panel consisting scientist regard making minor advance topic otherwise beaten death
If would like see high quality research funded better make case society elected representative control NSF budget research worth funding
NSF overseen National Science Board made distinguished scientist like
Computer science science algorithmic process underly information processing regardless whether information processing occurs computer built silicon chip living cell brain economy society culture
It science par physical biological social science
The science computing confused engineering artifact designed support computing artifact enabled computing
Funny
Some dramatic incremental advance field done BY INDUSTRY includes area relate hard science
Medical device abound example
Benoit Mandelbrot working IBM developed fractal geometry used massively geographical resource exploration computer graphic
Practical science funding advanced science engineering increment microchip communication technology
Computing biology become suffused genetics
There research relates computing breakthrough learned best processing mechanism Creation neurological network DNA digital symbolic language codign machinery
According The Innovator Dilemma Clayton Christensen paradigm shift technology disruptive innovation technology innovation ability replace marginalize existing technology paradigm
Some example light bulb candlelight automobile horse carriage digital v analog film technology internet previous information communication medium
All technological paradigm shift preceded scientific paradigm shift
A paradigm shift result person work year
It indeed work incremental BUT TOWARDS A NEW PARADIGM
hundred thousand even million people setting conceptual framework elaborating learning use
From Maxwell physicist working practical application people developing building power station entirely new infrastructure million user new technology
To work improving electric bulb make sense start evident discovery electricity potential provide radically better solution
No progress humanity possible without incremental research best happens within best available paradigm
Today new paradigm computing emerging see Peter Dennings Computing natural science http To ignore paradigm shift would prefer candlelight electric bulb
And pradigm shift way today variety research field almost closely related computing
I recently experience ERC grant application one mentioned article
Among thing I find statement summarized problem open interesting clearly innovative aim combining result approach two major mathematician early XXth century funded
Had said solve problem I could make nothing object
But saying funded new thing apriori relevant problem opened long time interested great character raise question criterion funding IMHO

An alternate succinct definition computer science study automating algorithmic process scale
A specializes theory computation design computational system
Its field divided variety theoretical
Some field explores fundamental property intractable problem highly abstract field emphasize visual application
Other field still focus challenge implementing computation
For example considers various approach description computation study investigates various aspect use
considers challenge making computer computation useful usable human
The earliest foundation would become computer science predate invention modern
Machines calculating fixed numerical task existed since antiquity aiding computation multiplication division
Further performing computation existed since antiquity even development sophisticated computing equipment

He started developing machine le two year sketched many salient feature modern computer
A crucial step adoption punched card system derived making infinitely programmable
In translation French article Analytical Engine wrote one many note included algorithm compute considered first computer program
Around invented used process statistical information eventually company became part
In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software
formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation made representative ACM IEEE CS four area considers crucial discipline computer science
In addition four area CSAB also identifies field software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation important area computer science
mathematical abstract spirit derives motivation practical everyday computation

Programming language theory branch computer science deal design implementation analysis characterization classification individual
It fall within discipline computer science depending affecting software engineering
It active research area numerous dedicated academic journal
Formal method particular kind based technique development software system
The use formal method software hardware design motivated expectation engineering discipline performing appropriate mathematical analysis contribute reliability robustness design
They form important theoretical underpinning software engineering especially safety security involved
Formal method useful adjunct software testing since help avoid error also give framework testing
For industrial use tool support required
However high cost using formal method mean usually used development safety utmost importance
Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Computer architecture digital computer organization conceptual design fundamental operational structure computer system

Software engineering study designing implementing modifying software order ensure high quality affordable maintainable fast build
It systematic approach software design involving application engineering practice software
Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

Back January President Obama would federal government largest targeted funding promoting subject school
The proposal seemed designed generate headline actual funding nearly year road largely seems happened
In Monday highlighting administration Computer Science All initiative accomplished year White House presented long list action taken state city business nonprofit
In fact achievement stemmed federal government direct involvement
Congress never set aside requested billion meaning highlight Obama computer science initiative windfall federal funding never came pas
The president proposal funding really request Congress know last year Congress really reacting well president request say Hadi Partovi founder nonprofit focused computer science education
Congress yet even pas budget year Obama proposal really gone nowhere
That say federal government offered funding whatsoever
Though far cry billion million funding computer science education initiative allocated government agency
The National Science Foundation announced plan direct million funding doled across five year computer science education research
An initial million given grant year another million worth grant opened week
This funding strictly place computer science education school used research best teach computer science school choose adopt
The agency behind AmeriCorps also give million three year support teacher training computer science education
And law passed tail end opened Department Education funding
These agency generally welcome money like Trump administration could move goalpost
If Congress significantly alters NSF funding give cause change priority agency may go back million promise
Kumar Garg assistant director White House Office Science Technology Policy also cited AP computer science course launched nationwide year thanks part NSF one administration achievement
We appreciated bipartisan support seen important issue hope Congress continue take step support computer science Garg wrote email
He said organization responded president call action
In case achievement White House highlight occurring since January largely stem NSF AmeriCorps funding
The White House cite thing like Google launching computer science career prep program happened governor calling federal funding CS education occurred via petition organized Computer Science Education Coalition group made primarily dozen tech company Apple Zynga
That mean actually happened past year state local progress
As Partovi put The White House done important service calling attention great work already done But enabling others whatever small extent could may well White House real goal certainly Obama knew billion never going happen
I think hope White House call action January would produce lot local movement showing done priority
It one thing district thinking country say Michael Preston executive director CSNYC nonprofit helping New York City implement plan computer science education available student
Preston say education mostly local enterprise federal government role
And Obama attention computer science education say end helping local organizer
It meaningful say
You president naming computer science education State Union address first five minute year
That Partovi echo sentiment well
The president announcement importance computer science symbolically amplifies increase level attention important field say
So using bully pulpit president say computer science longer optional skill basic skill message educator around country even around world heard make strong symbolic difference term school Cities state increasingly moving include computer science education curriculum past several year
In addition New York City Chicago San Francisco also implementing computer science school
Last year Arkansas requiring computer science education public charter high school statewide year public school
This week alone Computer Science Education Week expects million student complete Hour Code lesson tutorial meant fun simple way teaching programming basic student
created popularized format available company like Microsoft Google taught school classroom available workshop location like Apple Stores
Partovi still holding hope federal funding come Congress help cause
It definitely disappointment fund allocated year say encouraged fact Congress explicitly shoot idea either leaving open possibility federal funding could still come future
The idea funding computer science The Computer Science Education Coalition includes pushing much smaller goal million federal funding computer science education
That enough group say reach million student year
The coalition formed March intends continue pressing Congress funding next year
Many senior member office still Partovi say
And waiting see Trump administration Command Line delivers daily update

It seems misunderstanding NSF message
As someone served several NSF panel significant involvement assessing application funding country US I painfully aware many application funding agency tweaking already method produce yet another paper ten

I regularly read paper introduction promise solve world problem cimate change global financial crisis I second section I realise idea essentially trivial could worked anyone modicum intelligence half hour le
This section followed others tedious simulation called experiment described designed prove idea work Karl Popper need
Why paper occupy space top tier journal
And yet I sure know many journal paper like

The NSF many funding agency well aware situation trying something
Yes perhaps language little hyped least move right direction
Unfortunately whole academic research sector metricized impact factor ranking suit administration fighting losing battle
Just check many paper Andrew Wiles solver Fermat Perelman solver Poincare written career think real impact
I seeing comment sorry
I understand predicament funding agency describe
What want exclude however bad incremental research
This mean rejecting incremental research pretending good research
This especially true proposal level perfectly reasonable good scientist propose improving someone else result
If funding granted decision based reasonable criterion research might produce breakthrough rare event difficult predict

Computer Science All President bold new initiative empower American student kindergarten high school learn computer science equipped computational thinking skill need creator digital economy consumer active citizen world
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing computer science CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility
CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example
These statistic mirror current makeup America largest innovative tech firm woman compose le technical employee le percent
We better
Tech career exciting fun collaborative well critical economy
We want Americans opportunity part team
CS For All help make reality ensure every student access Computer Science classroom level
When come computer science student President Obama led way CS Student became first President write line code
His first line code moveForward CS All moving forward together
Who taught code
A student named Adrianna Newark New Jersey took computer science course school
If President start learning computer science
We know need basic tool make possible including teacher infrastructure
Thanks President well way making happen closing connectivity divide school half empowering million student broadband enlisting school district cause
And order make sure youth pathway workforce adult access skill President expanded city state rural area
Grace Clark sophomore International High School New Orleans Louisiana intern Operation Spark offer free technology training coding course young people New Orleans
Grace worked New Orleans Police Department policing data event taught New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison write first line code
She also teach coding child Arthur Ashe Elementary attended Essence Festival represent inner city youth coding technology
Christina Li senior Adlai Stevenson High School Macomb Michigan She Vice President Controls FIRST robotics team ThunderChickens
Christina also created Hello World computer science day camp middle school girl learn code robot apps website game hope reducing gender gap computer science
Angelica Willis computer science student North Carolina Agricultural Technical State University Greensboro North Carolina
She used computer science skill help NASA develop ecological forecasting model using satellite support reforestation Rwanda
She spearhead initiative develop entrepreneurship design Maker Space youth underrepresented community Greensboro
The field computer science education come long way year
With support new high school course like Exploring Computer Science AP Principles Computer Science designed inclusive accessible student course program designed early elementary school
NSF also funded middle school freshman focused course called Bootstrap curriculum emerged teach computer science computational thinking elementary middle high school
Because CS active applied field Science Technology Engineering Math STEM learning allows student engage interaction key math science engineering principle give student opportunity creator consumer digital economy active citizen world
CS also help foster computational thinking skill relevant many discipline career breaking large problem smaller one recognizing new problem relate problem already solved setting aside detail problem le important identifying refining step needed reach solution
CS also complement President initiative focus growing democratization hardware software tool needed design make anything
As teacher school leader superintendent help expand CS All many different way
For example Spanish computer science teacher creative director Young Women Leadership School Astoria New York integrated digital education coding class including Spanish
Andrea also lead group student known Tech Crew composed filmmaker graphic designer coder website designer project manager
Under Andrea guidance young woman collaborate solve problem around school like teaching student recycling coding educational video game
grade science teacher Cloonan Middle School Stamford Connecticut
Jim Stamford Public Schools Teacher Year
He planed city wide STEM festival providing STEM professional development curate popular STEM Education Twitter handle stemnetwork
He also sponsor Computer Coding Club printing club Cloonan Middle School
assistant professor computer science University Nevada Las Vegas
For last decade creating technology make easier people including disability write computer software
With grant NSF established first national educational infrastructure blind visually impaired student learn computer science
He inventor Quorum first programming language
States city leader movement expand CS education
In responding President call action give student opportunity learn CS
In past year Republican Democratic state leader championed ambitious CS effort New York City announced aggressive plan expand CS opportunity student
Today leader state local level announcing new expanded commitment expand CS including The Chattanooga community worked together create ecosystem youth learn computer science skill prepared future industry
Cordell Carter Chief Executive Officer TechTown Foundation learning center offer program child skill level age
TechTown approach aim give youth experience allowing kid discover learn explore limitless possibility imagination
researcher University California Los Angeles investigates woman student color learned computer science
She collaborator support National Science Foundation created Exploring Computer Science high school curriculum teacher professional development program committed reaching student especially underserved community school exists across nation including seven largest school district
retired computer science math teacher Houston Texas advocated Computer Science education since
She fought keep computer science certification teacher played integral part increasing programming computational thinking Texas math standard
She serf affiliate Code Buddy Spring Branch Independent School District
A growing list district leader committing support President vision expanded computer science curriculum student
Dozens private sector partner nonprofit organization well state local government stepped support CS All commitment
Today announcement build upon bipartisan progress state like Washington Arkansas
Both state announced ambitious computer science education effort passed legislation make computer science count towards high school graduation
Similarly city like New York Chicago San Francisco already announced major expansion computer science education
Local leader using computer science solve many intractable local challenge opportunity Check
Involving young people real problem help solve community best practice education exciting youth
typically significant computer science opportunity American youth pull partner solving challenge engaging future
Seattle leadership hosted involving community member across city
New Orleans engaging youth others open data initiative part work Police Data Initiative city

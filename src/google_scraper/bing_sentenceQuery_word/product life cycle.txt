The product life cycle marketing theory cycle succession strategy experienced every product begin product introduction sometimes referenced research development followed sale growth maturity finally market saturation decline
The product life cycle parallel analogous human being animal
birth growth maturity decline eventually death
For product involves many discipline skill tool process product go market force involving raw material part various business process cost distribution market sale
The four phase Product Life cycle follows Market Introduction Stage The new product idea processed research development R D
Costs high usually little competition unless competition simultaneously R D marketing personnel start creating customer product sale future
Growth The new product begin sell revenue increase new competition often enters market
Efforts made expand distribution innovative feature capability product take precedence price
Successful product see high profit level stage cost decrease economy scale product public awareness increase
As competition increase still price becomes critical start decrease small degree large price war present competing product fight market share
Maturity The new product becomes somewhat le new standardized well known established increasingly distributed larger market national even international dimension
Cost war intensify production facility streamlined sometimes even moved location cheap labor control cost
Sales volume maximized market saturation reached price competition force process still lower
Public consumption becomes dependent upon brand preference feature diversification company competition struggle maintain increase market share
Near end stage profit decrease
Decline The new product rapidly becoming obsolete low income consumer enter market product imported developing country
Efforts made cut production distribution cost become main concern sale profit margin decline even
Profits become little viable product eventually retired marking end product life cycle
The life cycle technology product different industry although one could argue speed product becomes obsolete much greater

Lifecycle management help plan computer acquisition disposal
Images Effective life cycle management help business extend usable life computer enable get best return IT investment
Even machine rapidly go date computer last forever
Understanding key stage computer life cycle help plan future IT acquisition identify point maintaining old technology longer cost effective
The first part organization computer life cycle planning phase
This organization identifies requirement selects computer specification looking buy
This followed purchasing phase
During purchasing phase organization attempt source required computer lowest possible price
Computer vendor may attempt sweeten deal offering bulk discount favorable delivery term especially organization looking place large order
Once organization received new hardware generally need deploy
The first step deployment phase position unbox connect new computer hardware
Once complete computer configured accept organization specific network setting required software data need migrated
If computer purchased use spare may time lapse purchasing deployment phase
The operation phase make bulk computer useful lifespan
This phase computer used purpose purchased
It extended sensible user practice regular backup virus scan software update
The operation phase usually run alongside support phase see computer maintained organization IT support team
The support phase often involves regular hardware service software update user training
Upgrading see machine hardware component replaced modern part
This extend computer lifespan enable perform new task
Hardware upgrade usually involve either replacing internal component RAM adding external peripheral external hard drive USB hub
However upgrade cost effective total cost part labor le completely new computer improvement extend computer life reasonable period
All computer require retiring eventually finding asset management company Redemtech showing average total life computer three year laptop four year desktop
The retirement phase involves decommissioning computer making appropriate arrangement disposal hardware
This usually involves reselling recycling keeping machine spare part
A computer must fully wiped sensitive business data retirement usually securely formatting physically destroying hard drive

This life cycle go several predictable stage
Understanding stage help producer consumer get longest possible life span product get best return investment
This especially true case world technology
The life product usually considered begin made available first shipped customer
The life product end producer stop production longer service support product
The length cycle varies product type product
For hardware life cycle may depend complexity power hardware innovation built product pace new technology
For software life expectancy longer many producer support multiple version product
product tend longer life expectancy speed innovation built
In phase sometimes called bleeding edge technology product first introduced
This phase generally last product fully tested bug compatibility issue fixed
The length introductory phase depends revolutionary product much change customer need make existing technology use product type support needed new product
Innovative expensive product using new technology often longer introductory phase product merely upgrade existing technology
Technology product reach phase bug ironed company individual begin purchase product
The manufacturer begin producing selling larger volume
The technology stable benefit product become apparent company individual feel safe buy product
This majority sale product produced sold high volume
This phase begin manufacturer release new product target customer existing product designed replace
This also happen different manufacturer release product designed compete existing product
The new product ideally contains advantage innovation old product
The length phase depends long introductory phase new product last manufacturer decides stop making old product
This phase begin manufacturer stop making selling product finish manufacturer stop offering support product
For expensive large hardware product phase last many year manufacturer may contract large customer continue offering support service
For software phase may much shorter easier cheaper upgrade software new version
Most technology producer make sure phase long enough allow customer move new product

During product introduced market
Typically characteristic stage include heavy influence advertising raise product awareness along le revenue made time
For example let say product called The Bot computerized robot assist thing household chore cleaning
The introduction stage product life cycle The Bot primarily consist organization trying educate public existence promotional activity along initially high cost
Since product still introduced market chance earn sufficient revenue offset cost produce time
The second stage product life cycle
This stage reflects largest increase profit product entire cycle
Using example The Bot growth stage organization begin see hard work pay increased sale product
This increase due part successful promotional awareness campaign introductory stage causing people know product
The increase sale also attributed reduction cost due economy scale
At point product life cycle product enters stage growth begin level remain rather constant
This
This stage characterized slower growth due increase rival competitor entering market

The last stage product life cycle product
This stage often characterized significant loss revenue accompanied difficulty trying earn consistent revenue
This result increased amount saturation market
The reason decline may range consumer already purchased product microwave oven home many people consumer purchasing product competitor
During decline stage product The Bot must seek cushion blow significant revenue loss
This done various method one example finding alternative us product
In case The Bot perhaps organization earn revenue stage using part us scrap metal part car

Most computer chip primarily composed crystalline silicon
The first step therefore silicon mining purification
Among many thing requires energy
Energy one input mining purifying process
The output purified silicon get shipped computer chip factory
The computer chip factory take purified silicon make crystal wafer form
The purified silicon input manufacturing process
Only pure silicon crystal used process becomes part chip
The silicon end chip either come recyclable output waste
Of silicon end part chip used make solar panel rest either disposed recycled back system
If waste used input different process solar panel manufacture case recycled material actually wasted
This one way industrial ecologist try reduce waste identify process actually use process waste input
Then factory etches circuit silicon wafer clean etched wafer place transistor circuit chip
The input process among thing chemical etch silicon water flush
For memory chip plastic package pound water used Williams et al
The water used process must purified used
It used wash silicon wafer passed system waste effluent
This effluent contains chemical washed wafer therefore disposed according federal state regulation
About pound chemical used pound chip produced time weight chip
Finally factory cut wafer actual chip packaged form ready assembling product
Through every step production process energy required input
The silicon crystal used must extremely pure since tiniest impurity cause chip fail
Creating absolute clean environment required produce pure substance
It calculated equivalent pound fossil fuel used production memory chip packaging electricity generated fossil fuel particularly coal
Energy one important input manufacturing process
To get full picture impact product manufacture necessary follow entire chain input output upstream downstream
To manufacture computer chip input output process required produce supply energy silicon including mining material
input output process produce crystalline silicon including crystallization purified liquid silicon
input output process manufacture chip including etching circuit silicon wafer
input output process produce final packaged chip including plastic ceramic case metal pin encases chip
This beginning life computer chip
Once put electronic device turned chip consumes electricity energy
When device chip outlived usefulness chip disposed either waste recycled material
This disposal phase chip last phase life cycle
Computer chip high environmental impact relative weight
For every gram microchip gram fossil fuel used whereas every gram automobile gram fossil fuel used
This due fact making pure organized hence low entropy structure high entropy material require large energy input
Automobiles made heavy material require level purity sophistication material microchip
The energy used producing nine ten computer enough produce automobile

In industry process managing entire lifecycle product inception engineering design manufacture service disposal manufactured product
PLM integrates people data process business system provides product information backbone company extended enterprise
The inspiration burgeoning business process known PLM came AMC
The automaker looking way speed product development process compete better larger competitor according Vice President Product Engineering Development
Lacking massive budget General Motors Ford foreign competitor AMC placed R D emphasis bolstering product life cycle prime product particularly Jeeps
After introducing compact vehicle launched modern SUV market AMC began development new model later came
The first part quest faster product development CAD software system made engineer productive
The second part effort new communication system allowed conflict resolved faster well reducing costly engineering change drawing document central database
The product data management effective AMC purchased Chrysler system expanded throughout enterprise connecting everyone involved designing building product
While PLM technology Chrysler able become auto industry producer recording development cost half industry average
During Rockwell International developed initial concept PDM PLM bomber program
The system called Engineering Data System EDS augmented interface Computervision CADAM system track part configuration lifecycle component assembly
Computervison later released implementing PDM aspect lifecycle model specific Rockwell aerospace need
PLM system help organization coping increasing complexity engineering challenge developing new product global competitive market
Product lifecycle management PLM distinguished PLCM
PLM describes engineering aspect product managing description property product development useful life whereas PLCM refers commercial management life product business market respect cost sale measure
Product lifecycle management considered one four cornerstone manufacturing corporation structure
All company need manage communication information customer supplier fulfillment resource within enterprise product planning development PLM
One form PLM called PLM
While traditional PLM tool deployed release release phase PLM target design phase
As ICT development PROMISE project allowed PLM extend beyond traditional PLM integrate sensor data real time event data PLM well allowing information made available different player total lifecycle individual product closing information loop
This resulted extension PLM CL M
Documented benefit product lifecycle management include Within PLM five primary area The core PLM product lifecycle management creation central management product data technology used access information knowledge
PLM discipline emerged tool viewed integration tool method people process stage product life
It software technology also business strategy
For simplicity stage described shown traditional sequential engineering workflow
The exact order event task vary according product industry question main process The major key point event The reality however complex people department perform task isolation one activity simply finish next activity start
Design iterative process often design need modified due manufacturing constraint conflicting requirement
Whether customer order fit time line depends industry type whether product example built order engineered order assembled order
Many software solution developed organize integrate different phase product lifecycle
PLM seen single software product collection software tool working method integrated together address either single stage lifecycle connect different task manage whole process
Some software provider cover whole PLM range others single niche application
Some application span many field PLM different module within data model
An overview field within PLM covered
It noted however simple classification always fit exactly many area overlap many software product cover one area fit easily one category
It also forgotten one main goal PLM collect knowledge reused project coordinate simultaneous concurrent development many product
It business process people method much software application solution
Although PLM mainly associated engineering task also involves activity PPM particularly regard NPD
There several model industry consider rather similar
What follows one possible model emphasizes product similar phase would describe form product service including product The first stage definition product requirement based customer company market regulatory body viewpoint
From specification product major technical parameter defined
In parallel initial concept design work performed defining aesthetic product together main functional aspect
Many different medium used process pencil paper clay model CAID software
In concept investment resource research may included conception phase
bringing technology level maturity sufficient move next phase
However engineering iterative
It always possible something work well phase enough back prior phase perhaps way back conception research
There many example draw
This detailed design development product form start progressing prototype testing pilot release full product launch
It also involve redesign ramp improvement existing product well
The main tool used design development CAD
This simple drawing drafting parametric feature based modeling
Such software includes technology Hybrid Modeling KBE NDT Assembly construction
This step cover many engineering discipline including mechanical electrical electronic software architectural aerospace automotive
Along actual creation geometry analysis component product assembly
Simulation validation optimization task carried using CAE software either integrated CAD package
These used perform task Stress analysis FEA CFD mechanical event simulation MES
CAQ used task Dimensional analysis
Another task performed stage sourcing bought component possibly aid system
Once design product component complete method manufacturing defined
This includes CAD task tool design including creation CNC Machining instruction product part well creation specific tool manufacture part using integrated separate CAM software
This also involve analysis tool process simulation operation casting molding forming
Once manufacturing method identified CPM come play
This involves CAPE Computer Aided Production Engineering Computer Aided tool carrying factory plant facility layout production simulation
simulation industrial ergonomics well tool selection management
Once component manufactured geometrical form size checked original CAD data use inspection equipment software
Parallel engineering task sale product configuration marketing documentation work take place
This could include transferring engineering data geometry part list data web based sale configurator system
The final phase lifecycle involves managing information
This include providing customer service engineer support information required well
This involve use tool Maintenance Repair Operations Management software
There every product
Whether disposal destruction material object information need carefully considered since may legislated hence free ramification
None phase considered isolated
In reality project run sequentially separated product development project information flowing different people system
A major part PLM management product definition data
This includes managing engineering change release status component configuration product variation document management planning project resource well timescale risk assessment
For task data graphical textual meta nature product BOMs need managed
At engineering department level domain PDM software corporate level Enterprise Data Management EDM software rigid level distinction may consistently used however typical see two data management system within organization
These system may also linked corporate system
Associated system system planning
This central role covered numerous tool run throughout whole lifecycle across organization
This requires many technology tool area conferencing data sharing data translation
This specialised field referred includes technology DMU immersive virtual digital prototyping imaging
The broad array solution make tool used within PLM CAD CAM CAx initially used dedicated practitioner invested time effort gain required skill
Designers engineer worked wonder CAD system manufacturing engineer became highly skilled CAM user analyst administrator manager fully mastered support technology
However achieving full advantage PLM requires participation many people various skill throughout extended enterprise requiring ability access operate input output participant
Despite increased ease use PLM tool personnel entire PLM proven practical
Now however advance made address ease use participant within PLM arena
One advance availability role specific user interface
Through tailorable user interface UIs command presented user appropriate function expertise
These technique include British English workflow instead working sequentially stage carry number task parallel
For example starting tool design soon detailed design started detailed design product finished starting detail design solid model concept design surface model complete
Although necessarily reduce amount manpower required project change required due incomplete changing information drastically reduce lead time thus time market
CAD system many year allowed simultaneous work solid model drawing mean two separate file drawing looking data model model change drawing associatively update
Some CAD package also allow associative copying geometry file
This allows example copying part design file used tooling designer
The manufacturing engineer start work tool final design freeze design change size shape tool geometry update
Concurrent engineering also added benefit providing better immediate communication department reducing chance costly late design change
It adopts problem prevention method compared problem solving method traditional sequential engineering
design occurs definition model product start construction individual component
These virtually brought together one level full product digitally defined
This sometimes known review structure show product look like
The BOM contains physical solid component product CAD system may also always contain item required final product spite definite physical mass volume usually associated CAD geometry paint glue oil adhesive tape material
design tends focus capability available physical technology implementing solution technology suited
When solution value design much efficient design
The risk design efficiently provides solution problem
The focus design efficiently technology
rather focus What valuable thing
design focused functional requirement relatively le focus existing implementation technology
A top level spec repeatedly decomposed lower level structure specification physical implementation layer reached
The risk design may take advantage efficient application current physical technology due excessive layer abstraction due following abstraction path efficiently fit available component
separately specifying sensing processing wireless communication element even though suitable component combine may available
The positive value design preserve focus optimum solution requirement
A design may eliminate risk design
This start layout model often simple sketch defining basic size major defining parameter may include element
Geometry associatively copied next level represents different subsystem product
The geometry used define detail level
Depending complexity product number level assembly created basic definition component identified position principal dimension
This information associatively copied component file
In file component detailed classic assembly start
The assembly sometime known control structure
If single file used define layout parameter review structure often known skeleton file
Defense engineering traditionally develops product structure top
The system engineering process prescribes functional decomposition requirement physical allocation product structure function
This top approach would normally lower level product structure developed CAD data structure design
BEATM design design process endeavor combine best feature design design one process
A BEATM design process flow may begin emergent technology suggests solution may value may begin view important problem need solution
In either case key attribute BEATM design methodology immediately focus end design process flow view solution requirement view available technology may offer promise efficient solution
The BEATM design process proceeds end search optimum merging somewhere requirement efficient implementation
In fashion BEATM shown genuinely offer best methodology
Indeed best success story either successful intuitive yet unconscious use BEATM methodology
When employed consciously BEATM offer even powerful advantage
Front loading taking design next stage
The complete control structure review structure well downstream data drawing tooling development CAM model constructed product defined project authorized
These assembly file constitute template family product constructed
When decision made go new product parameter product entered template model associated data updated
Obviously predefined associative model able predict possibility require additional work
The main principle lot work already completed
A lot knowledge built template reused new product
This require additional resource front drastically reduce time project launch
Such method however require organizational change considerable engineering effort moved offline development department
It seen analogy creating test new technology future product case work directly used next product generation
Individual component constructed isolation
model component created within context component within product developed
This achieved using technique
Geometry component seen referenced within CAD tool used
The referenced component may may created using CAD tool geometry translated collaborative product development CPD format
Some assembly checking also carried using software
Product process lifecycle management alternate genre PLM process product made important product
Typically life science advanced market
The process behind manufacture given compound key element regulatory filing new drug application
As PPLM seek manage information around development process similar fashion baseline PLM talk managing information around development product
One variant PPLM implementation PDES
They typically implement whole development cycle manufacturing technology development initial conception development manufacture
PDES integrate people different background potentially different legal entity data information knowledge business process
Total spending PLM software service estimated billion year
After PLM investment onwards showed higher growth rate general IT spending
According Malakooti five objective considered production system The relation five object presented pyramid tip associated lowest Cost highest Productivity highest Quality Flexibility greatest Sustainability

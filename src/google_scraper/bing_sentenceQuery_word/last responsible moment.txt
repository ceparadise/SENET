science craft art skill cunning hand collection used production accomplishment objective
Technology technique process like embedded allow operation without detailed knowledge working
The simplest form technology development use basic
The discovery later increased available source food invention helped human travel control environment
Developments historic time including lessened physical barrier allowed human interact freely global scale
The steady progress brought destructive power
Technology many effect
It helped develop advanced including today allowed rise
Many technological process produce unwanted known deplete natural resource detriment Earth
Innovations always influenced society raised new question
Examples include rise notion term human challenge
Philosophical debate arisen use technology disagreement whether technology improves worsens
similar movement criticize pervasiveness technology arguing harm environment alienates people proponent ideology view continued technological progress beneficial society
The use term technology changed significantly last year
Before century term uncommon English used either refer description study allude technical education chartered
The term technology rose prominence century connection
The term meaning changed early century American social scientist beginning translated idea German concept technology
In German European language distinction exists absent English usually translates term technology
By technology referred study industrial art
In American sociologist Read Bain wrote technology includes tool machine utensil weapon instrument housing clothing communicating transporting device skill produce use
Bain definition remains common among scholar today especially social scientist
Scientists engineer usually prefer define technology rather thing people make use
More recently scholar borrowed European philosopher technique extend meaning technology various form instrumental reason work
Dictionaries scholar offered variety definition
The offer definition term use science industry engineering invent useful thing solve problem machine piece equipment method created technology
Real World Technology lecture gave another definition concept practice way thing around
The term often used imply specific field technology refer rather technology whole
defines technology two way pursuit life mean life organized inorganic matter
Technology broadly defined entity material immaterial created application mental physical effort order achieve value
In usage technology refers tool machine may used solve problem
It term may include simple tool wooden complex machine
Tools machine need material virtual technology fall definition technology
defines technology similarly broad way mean fulfill human purpose
The word technology also used refer collection technique
In context current state humanity knowledge combine resource produce desired product solve problem fulfill need satisfy want includes technical method skill process technique tool raw material
When combined another term medical technology space technology refers state respective field knowledge
technology refers available humanity field
Technology viewed activity form change culture
Additionally technology application math science art benefit life known
A modern example rise technology lessened barrier human interaction result helped spawn new subculture rise basis development
Not technology enhances culture creative way technology also help facilitate war via tool gun
As cultural activity technology predates formalize aspect technological endeavor
The distinction science engineering technology always clear
systematic knowledge physical material world gained observation experimentation
Technologies usually exclusively product science satisfy requirement
Engineering process designing making tool system exploit natural phenomenon practical human mean often always using result technique science
The development technology may draw upon many field knowledge including scientific engineering knowledge achieve practical result
Technology often consequence science engineering although technology human activity precedes two field
For example science might study flow using tool knowledge
This knowledge may used engineer create new tool machine form advanced technology
In sense scientist engineer may considered technologist three field often considered one purpose research reference
The exact relation science technology particular debated scientist historian policymakers late century part debate inform funding basic applied science
In immediate wake example widely considered United States technology simply applied science fund basic science reap technological result due time
An articulation philosophy could found explicitly treatise postwar science policy New product new industry job require continuous addition knowledge law nature
This essential new knowledge obtained basic scientific research
In however view came direct attack leading towards initiative fund science specific task initiative resisted scientific community
The issue remains contentious though analyst resist model technology simply result scientific research
The use tool partly process discovery evolution
Early human evolved already brain mass approximately one third modern human
Tool use remained relatively unchanged early human history
Approximately year ago use tool emerged believed many archaeologist connected emergence fully modern
Hominids started using primitive stone tool million year ago
The earliest stone tool little fractured rock approximately year ago provided way make much finer work
The discovery utilization simple source many profound us turning point technological evolution humankind
The exact date discovery known evidence burnt animal bone suggests domestication fire occurred Ma scholarly consensus indicates controlled fire ka
Fire fueled allowed early human cook food increase digestibility improving nutrient value broadening number food could eaten
Other technological advance made Paleolithic era shelter adoption technology dated exactly key humanity progress
As Paleolithic era progressed dwelling became sophisticated elaborate early ka human constructing temporary wood hut
Clothing adapted fur hide hunted animal helped humanity expand colder region human began Africa ka continent
Human technological ascent began earnest known Period New Stone Age
The invention polished major advance allowed large scale create farm
This use polished stone ax increased greatly Neolithic originally used preceding area
fed larger population transition allowed simultaneously raising child infant longer needed carried one must
Additionally child could contribute labor raising crop readily could economy
With increase population availability labor came increase
What triggered progression early Neolithic village first city first civilization specifically known however emergence increasingly social structure specialized labor trade war amongst adjacent culture need collective action overcome environmental challenge thought played role
Continuing improvement led provided first time ability native metal found relatively pure form nature
The advantage copper tool stone bone wooden tool quickly apparent early human native copper probably used near beginning time ka
Native copper naturally occur large amount copper ore quite common produce metal easily burned wood charcoal fire
Eventually working metal led discovery BCE
The first us iron alloy date around BCE
Meanwhile human learning harness form energy
The earliest known use wind power earliest record ship sail Nile boat dating millennium BCE
From prehistoric time Egyptians probably used power annual irrigate land gradually learning regulate much purposely built irrigation channel catch basin
The ancient used complex system canal levee divert water river irrigation
According archaeologist invented around BCE probably independently nearly simultaneously Mesopotamia Northern Caucasus Central Europe
Estimates may occurred range BCE expert putting closer BCE
The oldest artifact drawing depicting wheeled cart date BCE however wheel may use millennium drawing made
More recently wooden wheel world found Ljubljana marsh Slovenia
The invention wheel revolutionized trade war
It take long discover wheeled wagon could used carry heavy load
The ancient Sumerians used may invented
A stone pottery wheel found date around BCE even older fragment pottery found area
Fast rotary potter wheel enabled early pottery use wheel transformer energy windmill even treadmill revolutionized application nonhuman power source
The first cart derived first used Mesopotamia around BCE
The oldest known constructed roadway street Ur dating circa BCE timber road leading swamp dating around time period
The first road came use around BCE spanned mile paved partially maintained
In around BCE Greek island built road leading palace south side island mountain palace north side island
Unlike earlier road Minoan road completely paved
Ancient Minoan private home
A bathtub virtually identical modern one unearthed Palace Knossos
Several Minoan private home also could flushed pouring water drain
The ancient Romans many public flush toilet emptied extensive
The primary sewer Rome construction began sixth century BCE still use today
The ancient Romans also complex system used transport water across long distance
The first built BCE
The eleventh final ancient Roman aqueduct built CE
Put together Roman aqueduct extended kilometer le seventy kilometer ground supported arch
Innovations continued innovation first hundred year fall
saw use combined form complicated tool
The brought forth many innovation including facilitated greater communication knowledge technology became increasingly associated beginning cycle mutual advancement
The advancement technology era allowed steady supply food followed wider availability consumer good
Starting United Kingdom century period great technological discovery particularly area driven discovery
Technology took another step harnessing create innovation countless others
Scientific advancement discovery new concept later allowed advancement
The rise technology led broad whose inhabitant rely transport food supply
Communication also greatly improved invention
The late early century saw revolution transportation invention
The century brought host innovation
In discovery led
also invented later utilizing
subsequently led creation ushered current
Humans also able later used manned mission going way moon
In medicine era brought innovation later along new treatment
Complex technique organization needed make maintain new technology entire arisen support develop succeeding generation increasingly complex tool
Modern technology increasingly relies training education designer builder maintainer user often require sophisticated general specific training
Moreover technology become complex entire field created support including field made complex
Generally technicism belief utility technology improving human society
Taken extreme technicism reflects fundamental attitude seek control reality resolve problem use method tool
In word human being someday able master problem possibly even control future using technology
Some connect idea abdication religion higher
Optimistic assumption made proponent ideology view generally beneficial effect society human condition
In ideology technological development morally good
Transhumanists generally believe point technology overcome barrier commonly refer another barrier surpassed
Singularitarians believe sort rate technological progress accelerates obtain technology culminate invented progress nearly infinite hence term
Estimates date Singularity vary prominent futurist estimate Singularity occur
Kurzweil also known history universe six epoch epoch life epoch epoch technology epoch artificial intelligence epoch universal colonization epoch
Going one epoch next Singularity right period speeding precedes
Each epoch take shorter time mean whole history universe one giant Singularity event
Some critic see ideology example fear notion support
Some described
On somewhat skeptical side certain philosopher like believe technological society inherently flawed
They suggest inevitable result society become evermore technological cost freedom psychological health
Many prominent philosopher hold serious although entirely deterministic reservation technology see
According Heidegger scholar Charles Spinosa Heidegger oppose technology
He hope reveal essence technology way way confines u stultified compulsion push blindly technology come thing rebel helplessly
Indeed promise open expressly essence technology find unexpectedly taken freeing claim
What entail complex relationship technology either tend allow
Some poignant criticism technology found considered dystopian literary classic
In Faust selling soul devil return power physical world also often interpreted metaphor adoption industrial technology
More recently modern work science fiction film project highly ambivalent cautionary attitude toward technology impact human society identity
The late cultural critic distinguished society technological society called technopolies society dominated ideology technological scientific progress exclusion harm cultural practice value
written technology impact practice democratic culture suggesting technology construed object political debate mean medium discussion setting democratic deliberation citizenship
As setting democratic culture Barney suggests technology tends make question including question good life consists nearly impossible already give answer question good life one includes use technology
also danger new technology
He warns technology introduce unprecedented new challenge human being including possibility permanent alteration biological nature
These concern shared philosopher scientist public intellectual written similar issue

Another prominent critic technology published book
A infamous treatise written Unabomber printed several major newspaper later book part effort end bombing campaign infrastructure
The notion developed century thinker describe situation desirable use new technology required access centralized part skill imported elsewhere
The movement emerged part due concern
The inadequate quantity quality American job one fundamental economic challenge face
What linkage technology fundamental problem
In article Senior Fellow question widespread idea broadly technological advance mainly contributed growing problem
His thesis appears third way optimism skepticism
Essentially stand neutral approach linkage technology American issue concerning declining wage
He us two main argument defend point
First recent technological advance increasing number worker losing job
Yet scientific evidence fails clearly demonstrate technology displaced many worker created problem solved
Indeed threatens repetitive job job still necessary complement technology manual job requires flexibility judgment common sense remain hard replace
Second study shown clear link recent technology advance wage trend last decade
Therefore according Bernstein instead focusing technology hypothetical influence current American increasing unemployment declining wage one need worry bad policy fails offset imbalance demand trade income opportunity
For people use Internet mobile device excessive quantity likely experience exhaustion result disruption sleeping pattern
Continuous study shown increased weight gain associated people spend long hour online exercising frequently
Heavy Internet use also displayed school lower grade use excessive amount
It also noted use mobile phone whilst driving increased occurrence road accident particularly amongst teen driver
Statistically teen reportedly fourfold amount road traffic incident year older high percentage adolescent write read text driving
In context mass medium technology negative impact people mental physical health
stated technology considered key way solve problem need aware complex varied character use efficiently
What difference cooking machine
Can consider part none technology
Technology often considered narrowly according Hughes Technology creative process involving human ingenuity
This definition emphasis creativity avoids unbounded definition may mistakenly include cooking technology also highlight prominent role human therefore responsibility use complex technological system
Yet technology everywhere dramatically changed landscape society Hughes argues often believed use technology shape world want
They often supposed technology easily controllable assumption thoroughly questioned
For instance particularly challenge two concept solutionism
refers idea society convinced Internet one stable coherent force
Solutionism ideology every social issue solved thanks technology especially thanks internet
In fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainty limitation
According review Morozov theory ignore lead unexpected consequence could eventually cause damage problem seek address
Benjamin Cohen Gwen Ottinger also discussed multivalent effect technology
Therefore recognition limitation technology broadly scientific knowledge needed especially case dealing health issue
Ottinger continues reasoning argues ongoing recognition limitation scientific knowledge go hand hand scientist engineer new comprehension role
Such approach technology science require technical professional conceive role process differently
They consider collaborator research problem solving rather simply provider information technical solution
Technology properly defined application science accomplish function
The science leading edge well established function high visibility significantly mundane technology exploitation foundation competitive advantage
planning used build US industrial giant WWII used transform US
It planning
The use basic technology also feature animal specie apart human
These include primate community
Considering generic perspective technology ethology active environmental conditioning control also refer animal example beaver dam bee honeycomb
The ability make use tool considered defining characteristic genus
However discovery tool construction among chimpanzee related primate discarded notion use technology unique human
For example researcher observed wild chimpanzee utilising tool foraging tool used include leaf sponge termite fishing probe
also use stone hammer anvil cracking nut Brazil
often attempt predict future technology based science time
As prediction future however technology uncertain
In futurist predicted future technology would mainly consist overlapping GNR Revolution robotics important three

Given calm reasoned academic demeanor easy miss provocative Erik Brynjolfsson contention really
professor MIT Sloan School Management collaborator coauthor Andrew McAfee arguing last year half impressive advance computer improved industrial robotics automated translation largely behind sluggish employment growth last year
Even ominous worker MIT academic foresee dismal prospect many type job powerful new technology increasingly adopted manufacturing clerical retail work profession law financial service education medicine
That robot automation software replace people might seem obvious anyone worked automotive manufacturing travel agent
But Brynjolfsson McAfee claim troubling controversial
They believe rapid technological change destroying job faster creating contributing stagnation median income growth inequality United States
And suspect something similar happening technologically advanced country
Perhaps damning piece evidence according Brynjolfsson chart economist could love
In economics amount economic value created given unit input hour crucial indicator growth wealth creation
It measure progress
On chart Brynjolfsson like show separate line represent productivity total employment United States
For year World War II two line closely tracked increase job corresponding increase productivity
The pattern clear business generated value worker country whole became richer fueled economic activity created even job
Then beginning line diverge productivity continues rise robustly employment suddenly wilt
By significant gap appears two line showing economic growth parallel increase job creation
Brynjolfsson McAfee call great And Brynjolfsson say confident technology behind healthy growth productivity weak growth job
It startling assertion threatens faith many economist place technological progress
Brynjolfsson McAfee still believe technology boost productivity make society wealthier think also dark side technological progress eliminating need many type job leaving typical worker worse
point second chart indicating median income failing rise even gross domestic product soar
It great paradox era say
Productivity record level innovation never faster yet time falling median income fewer job
People falling behind technology advancing fast skill organization keeping Brynjolfsson McAfee Luddites
Indeed sometimes accused optimistic extent speed recent digital advance
Brynjolfsson say began writing book laid much argument wanted explain economic benefit new technology Brynjolfsson spent much sniffing evidence information technology boosting rate productivity
But became clear technology making many job safer easier productive also reducing demand many type human worker
Anecdotal evidence digital technology threaten job course everywhere
Robots advanced automation common many type manufacturing decade
In United States China world manufacturing powerhouse fewer people work manufacturing today thanks least part automation
Modern automotive plant many transformed industrial robotics routinely use machine autonomously weld paint body handled human
Most recently industrial robot like Rethink Robotics Baxter see flexible far cheaper predecessor introduced perform simple job small manufacturer variety sector
The website Silicon Valley startup called Industrial Perception feature video robot designed use warehouse picking throwing box like bored elephant
And sensation Google driverless car suggest automation might able accomplish someday soon
A le dramatic change one potentially far larger impact employment taking place clerical work professional service
Technologies like Web artificial intelligence big data improved made possible ever increasing availability cheap computing power storage automating many routine task
Countless traditional job many post office customer service disappeared
Brian Arthur visiting researcher Xerox Palo Alto Research Center intelligence system lab former economics professor Stanford University call autonomous It far subtle idea robot automation human job say involves digital process talking digital process creating new process enabling u many thing fewer people making yet human job obsolete
It onslaught digital process say Arthur primarily explains productivity grown without significant increase human labor
And say digital version human intelligence increasingly replacing even job thought require people
It change every profession way barely seen yet warns
McAfee associate director MIT Center Digital Business Sloan School Management speaks rapidly certain awe describes advance Google driverless car
Still despite obvious enthusiasm technology see recently vanished job coming back
The pressure employment resulting inequality get worse suggests digital enough computing power data geek exponential advance next several decade
I would like wrong say technology deployed need people But new technology really responsible decade lackluster job growth
Many labor economist say data best far conclusive
Several plausible explanation including event related global trade financial crisis early late could account relative slowness job creation since turn century
No one really know say Richard Freeman labor economist Harvard University
That difficult extricate effect technology macroeconomic effect say
But skeptical technology would change wide range business sector fast enough explain recent job number
Employment trend polarized workforce hollowed middle class
David Autor economist MIT extensively studied connection job technology also doubt technology could account abrupt change total employment
There great sag employment beginning
Something change say
But one know Moreover doubt productivity fact risen robustly United States past decade economist disagree statistic different way measuring weighing economic input output
If right raise possibility poor job growth could simply result sluggish economy
The sudden slowdown job creation big puzzle say lot evidence linked To sure Autor say computer technology changing type job available change always At least since say computer increasingly taken task bookkeeping clerical work repetitive production job typically provided pay
At time job requiring creativity skill often aided computer proliferated
So job demand increased restaurant worker janitor home health aide others service work nearly impossible automate
The result say Autor polarization workforce hollowing middle happening numerous industrialized country last several decade
But different saying technology affecting total number job add
Jobs change lot without huge change employment What even today digital technology holding job creation history suggests likely temporary albeit painful shock worker adjust skill entrepreneur create opportunity based new technology number job rebound
That least always pattern
The question whether today computing technology different creating involuntary unemployment
At least since Industrial Revolution began improvement technology changed nature work destroyed type job process
In percent Americans worked agriculture percent
Likewise proportion Americans employed manufacturing dropped percent War II year around percent increasing automation especially
While change painful worker whose skill longer match need employer Lawrence Katz Harvard economist say historical pattern show shift leading net decrease job extended period
Katz done extensive research technological advance affected job last example highly skilled artisan century displaced worker factory
While take decade worker acquire expertise needed new type employment say never run job
There trend eliminating work people
Over long term employment rate fairly stable
People always able create new job
People come new thing Still Katz dismiss notion something different today digital could affect even broader range work
The question say whether economic history serve useful guide
Will job disruption caused technology temporary workforce adapts see scenario automated process robot superhuman skill take broad swath human task
Though Katz expects historical pattern hold genuinely question say
If technology disrupts enough know happen To get insight Katz question worth looking today advanced technology deployed industry
Though technology undoubtedly taken human job finding evidence worker displaced machine large scale easy
One reason difficult pinpoint net impact job automation often used make human worker efficient necessarily replace
Rising productivity mean business work fewer employee also enable business expand production existing worker even enter new market
Take Kiva robot boon fledgling company
Created sold Kiva Systems startup founded bought Amazon million robot designed scurry across large warehouse fetching rack ordered good delivering product human package order
In Kiva large demonstration warehouse assembly facility headquarters outside Boston fleet robot move seemingly endless energy newly assembled machine perform test prove ready shipped customer around world others wait demonstrate visitor almost instantly respond electronic order bring desired product worker station
A warehouse equipped Kiva robot handle four time many order similar unautomated warehouse worker might spend much percent time walking retrieve good
Coincidentally Amazon bought Kiva soon press report revealed worker one retailer giant warehouse often walked mile day
Despite potential robot Mick Mountz Kiva founder CEO say doubt machine put many people work future
For one thing say Kiva customer retailer growing rapidly hire people fast enough
By making distribution operation cheaper efficient robotic technology helped many retailer survive even expand
Before founding Kiva Mountz worked Webvan online grocery delivery company one era infamous flameouts
He like show number demonstrating Webvan doomed start order cost company ship
Mountz point clear something mundane cost material handling consign new business early death
Automation solve problem
Meanwhile Kiva hiring
Orange color multiple cubicle sprawling office signaling occupant arrived within last month
Most new employee software engineer robot company poster boy innovation lie complex algorithm guide robot movement determine warehouse product stored
These algorithm help make system adaptable
It learn example certain product seldom ordered stored remote area
Though advance like suggest aspect work could subject automation also illustrate human still excel certain example packaging various item together
Many traditional problem teach machine recognize object say largely intractable especially difficult solve robot free move relatively unstructured environment like factory office
Techniques using vast amount computational power gone long way toward helping robot understand surroundings John Leonard professor engineering MIT member Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL say many familiar difficulty remain
Part see accelerating progress part see old problem say
I see hard anything robot
The big challenge In word people still far better dealing change environment reacting unexpected event
For reason Leonard say easier see robot could work human many application
People robot working together happen much quickly robot simply replacing human say
That going happen lifetime massive scale
The semiautonomous taxi still One friendlier flexible robot meant work human Rethink Baxter
The creation Rodney Brooks company founder Baxter need minimal training perform simple task like picking object moving box
It meant use relatively small manufacturing facility conventional industrial robot would cost much pose much danger worker
The idea say Brooks robot take care dull repetitive job one want
It hard instantly like Baxter part seems eager please
The eyebrow display rise quizzically puzzled arm submissively gently retreat bumped
Asked claim advanced industrial robot could eliminate job Brooks answer simply see way
Robots say factory worker electric drill construction worker It make productive efficient take The machine created Kiva Rethink cleverly designed built work people taking task human often want especially good
They specifically designed enhance worker productivity
And hard see even increasingly sophisticated robot replace human manufacturing industrial job anytime soon
But clerical professional job could vulnerable
That marriage artificial intelligence big data beginning give machine humanlike ability reason solve many new type problem
Even economy going transition extremely painful one many
In tony northern suburb New York City IBM Research pushing computing realm profession medicine finance customer service
IBM effort resulted Watson computer system best known beating human champion game show
That version Watson sits corner large data center research facility Yorktown Heights marked glowing plaque commemorating glory day
Meanwhile researcher already testing new generation Watson medicine technology could help physician diagnose disease like cancer evaluate patient prescribe treatment
IBM like call cognitive computing
Essentially Watson us technique advanced processing analytics massive amount data drawn source specific given application case health care mean medical journal textbook information collected physician hospital using system
Thanks innovative technique huge amount computing power quickly come advice example recent relevant information guide doctor diagnosis treatment decision
Despite system remarkable ability make sense data still early day Watson
While rudimentary ability learn specific pattern evaluate different possibility far type judgment intuition physician often need
But IBM also announced begin selling Watson service call center rarely require human judgment quite sophisticated
IBM say company rent updated version Watson use customer service agent responds question consumer already signed several bank
Automation nothing new call center course Watson improved capacity processing ability tap large amount data suggest system could speak plainly caller offering specific advice even technical complex question
It easy see replacing many human holdout new field
The contention automation digital technology partly responsible today lack job obviously touched raw nerve many worried employment
But one consequence McAfee see broader trend
The rapid acceleration technological progress say greatly widened gap economic winner income inequality many economist worried decade
Digital technology tend favor superstar point
For example someone creates computer program automate tax preparation might earn million billion dollar eliminating need countless accountant
New technology encroaching human skill way completely unprecedented McAfee say many job right bull even relatively work education medicine law affected
The middle seems going away add
The top bottom clearly getting farther While technology might one factor say McAfee underappreciated one likely become increasingly significant
Not everyone agrees Brynjolfsson McAfee contention impact recent technological change could different anything seen
But hard ignore warning technology widening income gap everyone else
And even economy going transition similar endured extremely painful one many worker addressed somehow
Harvard Katz shown United States prospered early part secondary education became accessible many people time employment agriculture drying
The result least increase educated worker found job industrial sector boosting income reducing inequality
Katz lesson painful consequence labor force follow inevitably technological change
Brynjolfsson say ready conclude economic progress employment diverged good
I know whether recover I hope say
But suggests depend recognizing problem taking step investing training education worker
We lucky steadily rising productivity raised boat much century say
Many people especially economist jumped conclusion way world worked
I used say took care productivity everything else would take care single important economic statistic
But longer He add It one dirty secret economics technology progress grow economy create wealth economic law say everyone In word race machine likely win many others lose

Thus providing mathematical description simple device capable arbitrary computation able prove property computation particular decision problem
Thus Turing machine prove fundamental limitation power mechanical computation
While express arbitrary computation minimalistic design make unsuitable computation practice based different design unlike Turing machine use
ability system instruction simulate Turing machine
A programming language Turing complete theoretically capable expressing task accomplishable computer nearly programming language Turing complete limitation finite memory ignored
A Turing machine general example control data manipulation done computer canonical machine using sequential memory store data
More specifically machine capable arbitrary subset valid string string part
Turing machine tape infinite length enables read write operation performed
Assuming Turing machine know whether eventually enumerate one specific string subset given program
This due fact unsolvable major implication theoretical limit computing
The Turing machine capable processing implies capable robustly evaluating logic infinite number way
This famously demonstrated
A Turing machine able simulate Turing machine called simply
A mathematically oriented definition similar universal nature introduced whose work intertwined Turing formal theory known
The thesis state Turing machine indeed capture informal notion provide precise definition mechanical procedure
Studying yield many insight
In essay Intelligent Machinery Turing wrote machine consisted The Turing machine mathematically model machine mechanically operates tape
On tape symbol machine read write one time using tape head
Operation fully determined finite set elementary instruction state symbol seen write symbol seen change state state symbol seen write change state etc
In original article On computable number application see also Turing imago mechanism person call computer executes deterministic mechanical rule slavishly Turing put desultory manner
More precisely Turing machine consists In model erasing writing symbol moving head left right specified separate instruction
Specifically table tell machine ia erase write symbol ib move head left right ii assume new state prescribed action ia ib instruction
In model entry table current combination symbol state machine halt model require entry filled
Note every part machine
state used tape given time action printing erasing tape motion unlimited amount tape runtime give unbounded amount
Following Hopcroft Ullman Turing machine formally defined Anything operates according specification Turing machine
The look like see busy beaver Initially tape cell marked
In word van Emde Boas The object formal description similar provides partial information machine behave computation look like
For instance Definitions literature sometimes differ slightly make argument proof easier clearer always done way resulting machine computational power
For example changing set None would allow machine stay tape cell instead moving left right increase machine computational power
The common convention represents Turing instruction Turing table one nine per convention Turing Davis Other author Minsky Hopcroft Ullman Stone adopt different convention new state listed immediately scanned symbol S For remainder article definition convention used
In following table Turing original model allowed first three line called cf
Turing
He allowed erasure scanned square naming symbol S erase blank etc
However allow every includes print symbol S erase cf
footnote Post
The abbreviation Turing
Subsequent Turing original paper allowed nine possible type Any Turing table list instruction constructed nine
For technical reason three N instruction usually dispensed
For example see
Less frequently use encountered represent atomization Turing instruction cf
Post Boolos Jeffrey also see
The word state used context Turing machine source confusion mean two thing
Most commentator Turing used state mean current instruction
content state register
But Turing made strong distinction record called machine machine person state progress computation current state total system
What Turing called state formula includes current instruction symbol tape Thus state progress computation stage completely determined note instruction symbol tape
That may described single expression sequence symbol consisting symbol tape followed Δ suppose appear elsewhere note instruction
This expression called formula
Earlier paper Turing carried even give example placed symbol current instruction scanned square together symbol tape call
To print complete configuration one line place scanned symbol
A variant seen Kleene show write machine situation place symbol q scanned square roughly center square tape see figure article put scanned square
But Kleene refers q machine state Kleene
Hopcroft Ullman call composite instantaneous description follow Turing convention putting current state scanned symbol
taken example run figure This mean three move tape head scanning state
Blanks case represented part total state shown tape single head scanning blank left state
State context Turing machine clarified described current instruction list symbol tape together current instruction list symbol tape together current instruction placed left scanned symbol right scanned symbol
Turing biographer Andrew Hodges noted discussed confusion
To right table expressed state transition diagram
Usually large table better left table Booth
They readily simulated computer tabular form Booth
However certain
machine reset state machine repeating pattern cf
Hill Peterson readily seen viewed drawing
Whether drawing represents improvement table must decided reader particular context

The reader cautioned diagram represent snapshot table frozen time course trajectory computation time space
While every time busy beaver machine run always follow true copy machine provided variable input parameter
The diagram Progress computation show busy beaver state instruction progress computation start finish
On far right Turing complete configuration Kleene situation instantaneous description step
If machine stopped cleared blank state register entire tape configuration could used rekindle computation anywhere progress cf

An interesting question whether computation model represented concrete Turing equivalent
While computation real computer based finite state thus capable simulate Turing machine programming language necessarily limitation
Kirner et shown among programming language Turing complete others
For example instantiation ANSI C different instantiation possible standard deliberately leaf certain behaviour undefined legacy reason imply memory
This size memory reference data type accessible inside language
However programming language like feature allows Turing complete principle
It Turing complete principle programming language allowed fail mean programming language Turing complete ignoring failed memory allocation compiled program executable real computer
Early paper Turing make distinction automatic machine motion completely determined configuration choice machine whose motion partially determined configuration
When machine reach one ambiguous configuration go arbitrary choice made external operator
This would case using machine deal axiomatic system
Turing elaborate except footnote describes use find provable formula Hilbert calculus rather use choice machine
He suppose choice always two possibility
Each proof determined sequence choice hence number completely determines proof
The automatic machine carry successively proof proof proof Footnote This indeed technique deterministic
Turing machine used mimic action Turing solved matter footnote appears dismiss consideration
An Turing pause computation state complete calculation awaits decision oracle unspecified entity apart saying machine Turing
The concept actively used mathematician
As Turing wrote italic added It possible invent used compute computable sequence
If machine supplied tape beginning written string quintuple separated semicolon computing machine compute sequence
This finding taken granted time considered astonishing
The model computation Turing called universal machine considered cf
Davis fundamental theoretical breakthrough led notion
Turing paper contains essence invention modern computer programming technique accompanied
In term universal Turing machine need slower factor compared machine simulates
This result obtained Hennie
Arora Barak theorem It often said Turing machine unlike simpler automaton powerful real machine able execute operation real program
What neglected statement real machine finite number real machine really nothing
On hand Turing machine equivalent machine unlimited amount storage space computation
However Turing machine intended model computer rather intended model computation
Historically computer compute fixed internal storage developed later
There number way explain Turing machine useful model real computer One way Turing machine poor model program many real program written receive unbounded input time therefore halt
Turing machine model ongoing computation well still model portion individual procedure
A limitation Turing machine model strength particular arrangement well
For instance modern computer actually instance specific form known RASP machine model
Like RASP store program memory external machine instruction
Unlike universal Turing machine RASP infinite number distinguishable numbered unbounded register cell contain integer cf
Elgot Robinson Hartmanis particular reference
The RASP machine equipped capability indirect addressing
content one register used address specify another register thus RASP program address register
The upshot distinction computational optimization performed based memory index possible general Turing machine thus Turing machine used basis bounding running time lower bound proven certain algorithm running time due false simplifying assumption Turing machine
An example algorithm shown perform quickly using RASP model computation rather Turing machine model
Another limitation Turing machine model concurrency well
For example bound size integer computed nondeterministic Turing machine starting blank tape
See article
By contrast concurrent system input compute integer unbounded size
A process created local storage initialized count concurrently sends stop go message
When receives go message increment count sends go message
When receives stop message stop unbounded number local storage
computing simulated Turing machine
In early day computing common use computer task series job processed given input data
However external input output communication real computer enable modeled Turing machine
This Turing machine requires input available initially tape input change input course computation possible
In practical term Turing machine capable model computation happens inside real computer capable model behaviour whole computer Turing machine model real computer communication capability used interaction
For example would possible model computer representing web server Turing machine another computer representing web client Turing machine connecting simulate web transaction web server client
Given example one might argue still possible model web server web client together single Turing machine
That true however miss point Turing machine model behaviour individual computer alone

In country world information revolution altered many aspect life significantly commerce employment medicine security transportation entertainment
Consequently information communication technology ICT affected good way bad way community life family life human relationship education career freedom democracy name example
Computer information ethic present essay understood branch applied ethic study analyzes social ethical impact ICT
The specific term computer ethic used past several different way
For example used refer application traditional Western ethic theory like utilitarianism Kantianism virtue ethic ethical case significantly involve computer computer network
Computer ethic also used refer kind professional ethic computer professional apply code ethic standard good practice within profession
In addition name cyberethics Internet ethic used refer computer ethic issue associated Internet
During past several decade robust rapidly growing field computer information ethic generated university course research professorship research center conference workshop professional organization curriculum material book journal
In mid innovative development science philosophy led creation new branch ethic would later called computer ethic information ethic
The founder new philosophical field American scholar Norbert Wiener professor mathematics engineering MIT
During Second World War together colleague America Great Britain Wiener helped develop electronic computer new powerful information technology
While engaged war effort Wiener colleague created new branch applied science Wiener named cybernetics Greek word pilot ship
Even War raging Wiener foresaw enormous social ethical implication cybernetics combined electronic computer
He predicted War world would undergo second industrial revolution automatic age enormous potential good evil would generate staggering number new ethical challenge opportunity
When War ended Wiener wrote book described new branch applied science identified social ethical implication electronic computer
Two year later published book explored number ethical issue computer information technology would likely generate
The issue identified two book plus later book included topic still important today computer security computer unemployment responsibility computer professional computer person disability information network globalization virtual community teleworking merging human body machine robot ethic artificial intelligence computer religion number subject
See Bynum
Although coined name cybernetics new science Wiener apparently see also creating new branch ethic
As result coin name like computer ethic information ethic
These term came use decade later
See discussion
In spite Wiener three relevant book lay powerful foundation use effective methodology today field computer information ethic
His thinking however far ahead scholar time many people considered eccentric scientist engaging flight fantasy ethic
Apparently one even Wiener recognized profound importance ethic achievement nearly two decade would pas social ethical impact information technology Wiener predicted late would become obvious scholar general public
In Wiener explored likely effect information technology upon key human value like
The metaphysical idea analytical method employed powerful could used effectively identifying analyzing resolving social ethical problem associated kind information technology including example computer computer network radio television telephone news medium journalism even book library
Because breadth Wiener concern applicability idea method every kind information technology term information ethic apt name new field ethic founded
As result term computer ethic typically used today name subfield Wiener much broader concern
In laying foundation information ethic Wiener developed cybernetic view human nature society led ethically suggestive account purpose human life
Based upon adopted great principle justice believed society ought follow
These powerful ethical concept enabled Wiener analyze information ethic issue kind
Wiener cybernetic understanding human nature stressed physical structure human body remarkable potential learning creativity human physiology make possible
While explaining human intellectual potential regularly compared human body physiology le intelligent creature like insect Given physiology human being possible take wide diversity information external world access information condition event within body process information way constitute reasoning calculating wondering deliberating deciding many intellectual activity
Wiener concluded purpose human life flourish kind organism human naturally Wiener account human nature presupposed metaphysical view universe considers world entity within including human combination information
Everything world mixture according Wiener actually
Consequently brain According Wiener metaphysical view everything universe come existence persists disappears continuous mixing mingling information
Living organism including human being actually pattern information persist ongoing exchange
Thus say human being We whirlpool river water
We stuff abides pattern perpetuate
Wiener The individuality body form rather bit substance
Wiener Using language today information age see example Lloyd Vedral would say according Wiener human being information object intellectual capacity well personal identity dependent upon persisting pattern information information processing within body rather specific bit
According Wiener human being flourish must free engage creative flexible action thereby maximize full potential intelligent being charge life
This purpose human life
Because people various level kind talent possibility however one person achievement different others
It possible nevertheless lead good human life flourish indefinitely large number way example diplomat scientist teacher nurse doctor soldier housewife midwife musician tradesman artisan
This understanding purpose human life led Wiener adopt called great principle justice upon society built
He believed adherence principle society would maximize person ability flourish variety flexibility human action
Although Wiener stated great principle assign name
For purpose easy reference let u call The Principle Freedom The Principle Equality The Principle Benevolence
Using Wiener word yield following list great principle pp
Justice requires liberty human develop freedom full measure human possibility embodied Justice requires equality A B remains position A B Justice requires good man man know limit short humanity Given Wiener cybernetic account human nature society follows people fundamentally social being reach full potential part community similar being
Society therefore essential good human life
however actually indeed violate three great principle justice
For reason Wiener explicitly adopted fourth principle justice assure first three would violated
Let u call additional principle The Principle Minimum Infringement Freedom What compulsion existence community state may demand must exercised way produce unnecessary infringement freedom
If one grant Wiener account good society human nature follows Sometimes ethical relativists use existence different culture proof could underlying ethical foundation society around globe
In response relativism Wiener could argue given understanding human nature purpose human life embrace welcome rich variety culture practice still advocating adherence great principle justice
Those principle offer even though leave room immense cultural diversity
The one restriction Wiener would require society must provide context human realize full potential sophisticated agent making decision choice thereby taking responsibility life
Wiener believed possible significant freedom equality human compassion prevail
Because Wiener think creating new branch ethic provide metaphilosophical comment analyzing information ethic issue case
Instead plunged directly analysis
Consequently want know Wiener method analysis need observe rather look metaphilosophical commentary upon procedure
When observing Wiener way analyzing information ethic issue trying resolve find example try
In given society network existing practice law rule principle govern human behavior within society
These policy borrow helpful word Moor constitute received policy cluster see Bynum Schubert reasonably society serve
Wiener methodology combine received policy cluster one society Wiener account human nature plus great principle justice plus critical skill clarifying vague ambiguous language
In way achieved effective method analyzing information ethic issue
Borrowing Moor later apt description computer ethic methodology Moor describe Wiener methodology follows In essentially society society received policy cluster reasonably method analyzing resolving information ethic issue likely result ethically good solution assimilated society
Note way information ethic require expertise trained philosopher although expertise might prove helpful many situation
Any adult function successfully reasonably society likely familiar existing custom practice rule law govern person behavior society enable one tell whether proposed action policy would accepted ethical
So must cope introduction new information technology whether computer professional business people worker teacher parent maker others engage information ethic helping integrate new information technology society ethically acceptable way
Information ethic understood important left information professional philosopher
Wiener information ethic interest idea method broad covering topic specific field computer ethic would call today also issue related area today called agent ethic see example Floridi Internet ethic Cavalier nanotechnology ethic Weckert
The purview Wiener idea method even broad enough encompass subfields like journalism ethic library ethic ethic bioengineering
Even late Wiener made clear view integration society newly invented computing information technology would lead remaking society second industrial revolution automatic age
It would affect every walk life would process requiring decade effort
In Wiener word new information technology placed human being presence another social potentiality importance good However think creating new branch ethic Wiener coin name computer ethic information ethic describe
These term beginning computer ethic came common use year later starting mid work Walter Maner
see Maner Today information age Wiener predicted half century ago come existence metaphysical scientific foundation information ethic laid continues provide insight effective guidance understanding resolving ethical challenge engendered information technology kind
In nearly three decade publication Wiener book Walter Maner noticed ethical question problem considered Medical Ethics course Old Dominion University often became complicated significantly altered computer got involved
Sometimes addition computer seemed Maner actually generated
He concluded new branch applied ethic similar already existing field like medical ethic business ethic
After considering name information ethic decided instead call proposed new field computer ethic
At time Maner know computer ethic work Norbert Wiener
He defined proposed new field one study ethical problem aggravated transformed created computer technology
He developed experimental computer ethic course designed primarily student computer science program
His course success student university wanted teach regularly
He complied wish also created starter kit teaching computer ethic prepared dissemination attendee workshop ran speech gave philosophy conference computing science conference America
In Helvetia Press National Information Resource Center Teaching Philosophy published Maner computer ethic starter kit monograph Maner
It contained curriculum material pedagogical advice university teacher
It also included rationale offering course university suggested course description university catalog list course objective teaching tip discussion topic like privacy confidentiality computer crime computer decision technological dependence professional code ethic
During early Maner widely disseminated Helvetia Press college university America elsewhere
Meanwhile Maner continued conduct workshop teach course computer ethic
As result number scholar especially philosopher computer scientist introduced computer ethic Maner trailblazing effort
While Maner developing new computer ethic course colleague Philosophy Department Old Dominion University Deborah Johnson became interested proposed new field
She especially interested Maner view computer generate ethical problem believe true
As result Maner Johnson began discussing ethic case allegedly involved problem brought computer
In discussion Johnson granted computer indeed transform old ethic problem interesting important way give new twist agree computer generated problem never seen
The resulting discussion initiated fruitful series comment publication nature uniqueness computer ethic series scholarly exchange started Maner Johnson later spread scholar
The following passage Maner keynote address drew number people discussion Over decade followed publication provocative passage extended uniqueness debate led number useful contribution computer information ethic
For example publication see Johnson Maner Tavani Himma Floridi Sanders Mather Bynum
By early Johnson joined staff Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute secured grant prepare set teaching material pedagogical module concerning computer ethic turned successful
She incorporated textbook published Johnson
On page noted computer pose new version standard moral problem moral dilemma exacerbating old problem forcing u apply ordinary moral norm uncharted She grant Maner claim however computer create ethical problem
Instead described computer ethic issue old ethical problem given new twist computer technology
Johnson book first major textbook field quickly became primary text used computer ethic course offered university country
For decade textbook set computer ethic research agenda topic ownership software intellectual property computing privacy responsibility computer professional fair distribution technology human power
In later edition Johnson added new ethical topic like hacking people computer without permission computer technology person disability ethic Internet
Also later edition Johnson continued discussion noting example new information technology provide new way instrument human action
Because agreed Maner new ethic question generated computer technology example Should ownership software protected law Do huge database personal information threaten privacy argued question merely new specie old moral issue protection human privacy ownership intellectual property
They insisted ethic problem requiring addition traditional ethical theory Maner claimed Maner
The year watershed year history computer ethic appearance Johnson textbook also James Moor classic paper What Is Computer Ethics published special issue journal
There Moor provided account nature computer ethic broader ambitious definition Maner Johnson
He went beyond description example computer ethic problem offering explanation computing technology raise many ethical question compared kind technology
Moor explanation revolutionary power computer technology computer logically malleable The logical malleability computer technology said Moor make possible people vast number thing able
Since one could question may never arisen whether one
In addition could done perhaps law standard good practice specific ethical rule ever established govern
Moor called situation policy vacuum vacuum might generate conceptual muddle In late Moor policy vacuum explanation need computer ethic account revolutionary logical malleability computer technology quickly became influential among growing number computer ethic scholar
He added additional idea including important notion According Moor human value important continued survival community essentially community value
Indeed community value core value soon would cease exist
Moor used core value examine computer ethic topic like privacy security Moor add account justice called consequentialism Moor theory combine core value consequentialism Bernard Gert deontological notion moral impartiality using blindfold justice
Moor approach computer ethic practical theory provides broad perspective nature information revolution
By using notion logical malleability policy vacuum conceptual muddle core value consequentialism provides following method The third step accomplished combining deontology consequentialism traditionally considered incompatible rival ethic theory achieve following practical result Beginning computer ethic work Norbert Wiener common thread run much history computer ethic namely concern Thus specific issue Wiener dealt case defending advancing value
For example working prevent massive unemployment caused robotic factory Wiener tried preserve security resource opportunity factory worker
Similarly arguing use machine Wiener tried diminish threat security peace
This approach computer ethic fruitful
It served example organizing theme major conference National Conference Computing Values Southern Connecticut State University see section exponential growth devoted impact computing upon
In late similar approach computer ethic called computer design emerged based upon insight potential problem avoided new technology development See example Brey Friedman Friedman Nissenbaum Introna Introna Nissenbaum Flanagan et
In early different emphasis within computer ethic advocated Donald Gotterbarn
He believed computer ethic seen ethic devoted development advancement standard good practice code conduct computing professional
Thus article Computer Ethics Responsibility Regained Gotterbarn said Throughout aspect computer ethic mind Gotterbarn worked advocate example Keith Miller Dianne Martin Chuck Huff Simon Rogerson variety project advance professional responsibility among computer practitioner
Even Gotterbarn part committee ACM Association Computing Machinery create third version organization Code Ethics Professional Conduct adopted ACM see Anderson et
Later Gotterbarn colleague ACM Computer Society IEEE Institute Electrical Electronic Engineers developed licensing standard software engineer
In addition Gotterbarn headed joint taskforce IEEE ACM create Software Engineering Code Ethics Professional Practice adopted organization see Gotterbarn Miller Rogerson
In late Gotterbarn created Software Engineering Ethics Research Institute SEERI East Tennessee State University see http early together Simon Rogerson developed computer program called SoDIS Software Development Impact Statements assist individual company organization preparation ethical stakeholder analysis determining likely ethical impact software development project Gotterbarn Rogerson
These many project focused attention upon advanced professionalization ethical maturation computing practitioner

In presentation The Computer Revolution Problem Global Ethics Krystyna made startling prediction see Górniak
She argued computer ethic eventually evolve global ethic applicable every culture earth
According Górniak hypothesis regional ethical theory like Europe Benthamite Kantian system well diverse ethical system embedded culture world derive local history custom unlikely applicable
Computer information ethic hand Górniak argued potential provide global ethic suitable Information Age The provocative Górniak hypothesis significant contribution ongoing uniqueness debate reinforced Maner claim made conference keynote address information technology force u discover new moral value formulate new moral principle develop new policy find new way think issue presented Maner Górniak speculate globally relevant concept principle would evolve information ethic
She merely predicted theory would emerge time global nature Internet resulting ethic conversation among culture world
Górniak may well right
Computer ethic today appears evolving broader even important field might reasonably called global information ethic
Global network especially Internet connecting people earth
For first time history effort develop mutually agreed standard conduct effort advance defend human value made truly global context
So first time history earth ethic value debated transformed context limited particular geographic region constrained specific religion culture
This could one important social development history Bynum Floridi
Consider global issue If computer user United States example wish protect freedom speech Internet whose law apply
Two hundred country interconnected Internet United States Constitution First Amendment protection freedom speech local law Internet apply rest world
How issue like freedom speech control pornography protection intellectual property invasion privacy many others governed law many country involved
Lessig If citizen European country example Internet dealing someone land government country considers dealing illegal European tried court country
In recent year rapid expansion global cyberbusiness
Nations appropriate technological infrastructure already place enjoyed resulting economic benefit rest world lagged behind
What political economic fallout inequality
In addition accepted business practice one part world perceived cheating fraud part world
Will wealthy nation widen already big gap rich poor
Will political even military confrontation emerge
If inexpensive access global information net provided rich poor alike people ghetto poor nation underdeveloped world etc
first time history nearly everyone earth access daily news free press text document art work great library museum world political religious social practice people everywhere
What impact sudden profound global education upon political dictatorship isolated community coherent culture religious practice etc
As great university world begin offer degree knowledge module via Internet lesser university damaged even forced business
The gap rich poor nation even rich poor citizen industrialized country already disturbingly wide
As educational opportunity business employment opportunity medical service many necessity life move cyberspace gap rich poor become even worse
Important recent development began appear confirming Górniak hypothesis particular metaphysical theory Luciano Floridi see example Floridi Flourishing Ethics theory present author combine idea Aristotle Wiener Moor Floridi see Bynum
Floridi developing information ethic theory henceforth argued purview computer ethic indeed ethic general widened include much simply human being action intention character
He developed FIE another macroethics term utilitarianism deontologism contractualism virtue ethic intended applicable ethical situation
On hand FIE traditional Western theory rather go beyond traditional theory overridden sometimes traditional ethical consideration
Floridi The name information ethic appropriate Floridi theory treat everything exists informational object process All entity described cluster data informational object
More precisely existing entity discrete encapsulated package containing At level abstraction informational system rather living system general raised role agent patient action environmental process change interaction equally described informationally
Floridi Since everything exists according FIE informational object process call totality exists universe considered whole infosphere
Objects process infosphere significantly damaged destroyed altering characteristic data structure
Such damage destruction Floridi call entropy result partial empoverishment infosphere
Floridi offer four fundamental principle FIE based upon idea everything infosphere least minimum worth ethically respected even worth overridden consideration By construing every existing entity universe informational least minimal moral worth FIE supplement traditional ethical theory go beyond shifting focus one ethical attention away action character value human agent toward evil harm dissolution destruction entropy suffered object process infosphere
With approach every existing entity human animal plant organization even artifact electronic object cyberspace piece intellectual property interpreted potential agent affect entity potential patient affected entity
In way Floridi treat FIE ethical theory used addition traditional anthropocentric ethical theory like utilitarianism deontologism virtue theory
FIE emphasis preserving enhancing infosphere enables Floridi provide among thing insightful practical ethical theory robot behavior behavior artificial agent like softbots cyborg
See example Floridi Sanders
FIE important component ambitious project covering entire new field Philosophy Information term
See Floridi The paragraph describe key contribution history idea information computer ethic history discipline includes much
The birth development new academic field require cooperation among critical mass scholar plus creation university course research center conference academic journal
In regard year pivotal information computer ethic
The publication Johnson textbook plus special issue journal October including especially Moor article What Is Computer Ethics provided excellent curriculum material conceptual foundation field
In addition Maner earlier trailblazing effort people inspired Maner generated audience enthusiastic computer science philosophy scholar
The stage set exponential growth
The formidable foundation computer information ethic Wiener laid late early far ahead time social ethical thinker follow lead help create vibrant growing field computer information ethic even earlier
In United States rapid growth occurred information computer ethic beginning
In Research Center Computing Society founded Southern Connecticut State University
Shortly thereafter Director present author joined Walter Maner organize National Conference Computing Values NCCV funded America National Science Foundation bring together computer scientist philosopher public policy maker lawyer journalist sociologist psychologist business people others
The goal examine push forward major information computer ethic namely computer security computer privacy ownership intellectual property computing person disability teaching computer ethic
More dozen scholar several different discipline joined Bynum Maner plan NCCV occurred August Southern Connecticut State University
Four hundred people American state seven country attended conference generated wealth new computer ethic material monograph video program extensive bibliography disseminated hundred college university following two year
In decade professional ethic advocate Donald Gotterbarn Keith Miller Dianne Martin professional organization Computer Professionals Social Responsibility Electronic Frontier Foundation Special Interest Group Computing Society SIGCAS ACM spearheaded project focused upon professional responsibility computer practitioner
Information computer ethic became required component undergraduate computer science program nationally accredited Computer Sciences Accreditation Board
In addition annual Computers Freedom Privacy conference began see ACM adopted new version Code Ethics Professional Conduct
In rapid growth information computer ethic spread Europe present author joined Simon Rogerson De Montfort University England create Centre Computing Social Responsibility organize first computer ethic conference Europe
That conference included attendee fourteen different country mostly Europe became key factor generating critical mass computer ethic scholar Europe
After every month another ETHICOMP conference occurred moving country country Europe beyond Spain Netherlands Italy Poland Portugal Greece Sweden Japan China Argentina Denmark France
In addition assistance Bynum Rogerson Australian scholar John Weckert Christopher Simpson created Australian Institute Computer Ethics organized Melbourne Australia first international computer ethic conference south equator
A number AICE conference occurred since see http
A central figure rapid growth information computer ethic Europe Simon Rogerson
In addition creating Centre Computing Social Responsibility De Montfort University influential ETHICOMP conference also added computer ethic De Montfort University curriculum created graduate program advanced computer ethic degree including PhDs Ben Fairweather two computer ethic journal see section Other Internet Resources electronic journal see Other Internet Resources
Rogerson also served Information Technology Committee British Parliament participated several computer ethic project agency European Union
Other important computer ethic development Europe late early included example Luciano Floridi creation Information Ethics Research Group Oxford University mid Jeroen van den Hoven founding CEPE Computer Ethics Philosophical Enquiry series conference occurred alternately Europe America van den Hoven creation journal Rafael Capurro creation International Center Information Ethics Capurro creation journal Bernd Carsten Stahl creation
In summary since computer ethic development proliferated exponentially new conference conference series new organization new research center new journal textbook web site university course university degree program distinguished professorship
Additional topic information computer ethic continually emerge information technology grows proliferates
Recent new topic include ethic agent ethic robot softbots cyborg ethic part human part machine open source movement electronic government global information ethic information technology genetics computing developing country computing terrorism ethic nanotechnology name example
For specific publication example see list selected resource
Compared many scholarly discipline field computer ethic young
It existed since late Norbert Wiener created
During next decade grew little Wiener insight far ahead everyone else
Beginning however information computer ethic grown exponentially first America Europe globally

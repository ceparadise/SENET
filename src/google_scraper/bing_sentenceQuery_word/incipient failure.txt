Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

However science infallible sometimes thing go wrong
In case scientific failure mean trip back drawing board
In others loss human life tragic result
Below particular order listed major failure century science technology
Chances computer run operating system OS Vista
If computer run Vista odds good wish
Vista release January preceded bad press known compatibility issue older PCs
Some reviewer claimed Vista actually ran slower PCs XP established stable robust OP
The result consumer enterprise user alike gave Vista back hand
Microsoft forced back plan sunset popular XP simultaneously replacement Windows much better received
While conventional nuclear energy based nuclear fission splitting atom Low Energy Nuclear Reaction commonly called cold fusion relies fusing atomic nucleus produce energy
The process properly harnessed could potentially produce limitless energy source common tap water
On March Stanley Pons Martin Fleischmann claimed perfected process
However initial flurry excitement cold fusion largely dismissed hoax ruining career Fleischmann Pons
Nonetheless experiment persisted decade
Some actually produced small amount tritium known cold fusion none demonstrated capacity energy production

In Dutch company began planning venture deposit four astronaut Mars April shipping new colonist Red Planet every two year none voyager returning Earth
Nonetheless permanent space colony remain beyond capability technology least logistical challenge involved
Establishing permanent space colony would require minimum oxygen food water medical resource mention hardy pioneer
In conclusion several failure modern science doomed remain failure
However failure need technology catch transformed success
Other innovation need financing perceived need become consumer ready

Karma Questions I want become computer scientist I want know normal day computer scientist like
Also I want know feel work big company Microsoft Apple Facebook etc
Student New York New York Karma Questions Enter phone number email send message update question


myEmail phone number email address required
United States America Software Engineer Google There always variation course multiple answer able build picture
I majored Computer Science college working Software Engineer Google
This common path technically different going Computer Science job
That would likely involve lot theoretical work I
On typical day Google I start checking email large part company California three hour later use email lot tends large amount built night I went home figure project start working
Sometimes I program needed run hour execute overnight I base start result reported
The division Google I large complicated program work revolves around
I usually handful different project involving
Right I adding feature customer investigating whether change one source data another one improving testing tool main program make better use Google infrastructure I involved finding place clean code base addition various small task
On given day I pick project based people waiting I get result old test simply I feel like I make progress start working
I actually spend much time writing new code main program I spend lot time examining see work add new piece writing test small change I make
I also write lot smaller program help thing like data analysis making tool others use
I usually work couple project different time day I get stuck one meeting usually happens least day I use boundary spur shift project
I work around hour day though vary slightly depending I making particularly large amount progress something want leave
I let make habit staying longer hour though since engineer degrades quality life
While working I try stay fairly focused though variety way take small mental break quick chat friend online work person work online people work website like Google News
I find I productive I give brief chance rest
So
Get work check email cycle among project mean writing code looking data I go home
I greatly enjoy though everyone
Thank much Eric
Senior Network Engineer Zynga Greetings Eddie
I pleased see variety answer question
Having weathered late worked several tech startup large r company since I happy ofder personal response question
In addition linear often repetitive task outlined thread professional I add variable On Call generally applies computer science type bona fide engineer work within Global Foundation Services GFS also sometimes referred DevEng DevOps SiteOps TechOps ITOps
The vast majority Tech organization operational infrastructure consists team On Call engineer share rotational Duty Roster defines escalation path Whom Shall I Contact Customer Affecting Outage
On Call engineer Network Engineering Site Reliability Engineering SRE typically support one company revenue stream Corporate Production
Production resource router switch firewall virtualized application server cluster database cluster typically reside physically secured datacenter environment
When something break On Call team called immediate service
The longer issue unscheduled website related maintenance example go unresolved revenue lost thoroughly company reputation damaged
As On Call Network Engineer I wear multiple hat often simultaneously I worked long hour straight scenario past however average day hour
proactive versus reactive work
Within dynamic context Internet environment remain long
The constant pace Big Business demand equipment data circuit upgraded seemingly endlessly
If think might enjoy almost academic work mind frequent stress occasional GRUELING hour career Network Engineering Site Operations may prove aspiration
Fiscal compensation reasonably good certainly quite acceptable however type work I perform daily considered utterly unacceptable many value insist upon static unchanging predictable seems popular term de rigueur
I know fewer peer held similar post endured divorce spouse specifically due interruptive unpredictable nature work
Your mileage may vary
I hope help
Good luck
Client Education Manager It truly depends type environment working
With related job around computer science find working ether waterfall agile based senario
Under waterfall I like call waterfail mentality find coding several project much communication client besides beginning end project
If working environment like important developed promised
There room change
The method called Agile
This iterative based mentality work one project time communicate client thoughout project
You still find coding lot interaction client throughout project
Note reflect type work implementing way work delivered
Software Engineer Test Sqrrl I test engineer experience bit different average developer lot procedure I get office around meeting talk yesterday planning today anything blocking u something stopping u moving forward completing task
It short meeting make sure team page
After I check email engineer startup mean inbox usually blissfully empty
I worked Amazon though I sift good amount email every morning
Then I pick whichever project I working day
We try avoid meeting afternoon startup even ca time
At bigger company meeting generally occur throughout day
My project usually consist writing automated test exercise new feature diagnosing test failure reviewing developer code occasionally manual testing release feature set automated testing wo work well
It definitely varies day day boring
I like say I get paid break people stuff actually fairly accurate
I generally office hour day typical startup ideal promote healthy balance work rest life
I sometimes office crunch time say working make deadline time rare perk make
Software developer general spoiled rotten
So summarise get sync team check email work project write code read code test code look data go home around pm
Much like Eric Google I enjoy much everybody

Every year organization hand Ig Nobel prize research project first make people laugh make think
For example year announced last week include prize nutrition researcher electronically modified sound potato chip make appear crisper fresher really biology prize researcher determined flea live dog jump higher flea live cat
Last year team studying sheet become wrinkled
That got u thinking Though Ig Nobels given many award information technology see reason history information technology littered project made people laugh type find humor people expensive failure
But made u think
Maybe much
IT project terrible track record
I get people learn say Mark author ship way
When look reason project failure like top list repeat say Holland also senior business architect consultant
Feature creep
Insufficient training
Overlooking essential stakeholder
They list time time
A popular management concept day failing forward idea OK fail long learn failure
In spirit motto Ig Nobel award present IT project may failed case failed spectacularly people involved able draw useful lesson
You notice many government project
That necessarily government fails often private sector regulation oversight make harder government cover mistake
Private enterprise hand bit better making sure fewer people know failure
So chronological order favorite IT boondoggle Ig Nobels
Feel free laugh try learn something
In group computer scientist IBM set build world fastest supercomputer
Five year later produced IBM
Stretch company first transistorized supercomputer delivered first unit Los Alamos National Laboratory
Capable handling instruction per second Stretch fastest computer world would remain
Nevertheless considered failure
IBM original bid Los Alamos develop computer time faster system meant replace Stretch came time faster
Because failed meet goal IBM drop Stretch price million planned million meant system priced cost
The company stopped offering sale nine ever built
That end story however
A lot went effort later helpful rest industry said Stretch team member Fran Allen recent event marking project anniversary
Stretch introduced pipelining memory protection memory interleaving technology shaped development computer know
Do throw baby bathwater
Even meet project main goal may able salvage something lasting value wreckage
The medium giant right think future home information delivery would via computer
Unfortunately insight came early computer mind expensive dedicated terminal
launched version service Florida extended city
The service offered banking shopping news ad delivered custom terminal color graphic capability beyond typical PC time
But Viewtron never took It meant McDonald videotex time cater upmarket consumer according representative time apparently notice contradiction goal
A Viewtron terminal cost initially price later dropped attempt stimulate demand time company made service available anyone standard PC videotex moment passed

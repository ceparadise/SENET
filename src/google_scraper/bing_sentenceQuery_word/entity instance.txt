In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In general entity pronounced existing real thing
The word root Latin make distinction thing existence quality
An entity exists need entity
The fact something exists also seems connote separateness existence entity
In programming engineering probably many context word used identify unit whether concrete thing abstract idea ready name label
In blackboard discussion one draw something yet unnamed refer drawing representation entity
If entity discussed later get ascribed quality name reference entity may longer useful
In usage entity close meaning used
Here usage know In Standard Generalized Markup Language entity specific character string effect causing formatting program print formatter Web browser format display screen select present particular character notation
In usage entity certain string character together specify unique font selected displayed printed
A word needed character string entity came handy
In HTML usage SGML special entity character string given name entity therefore called named entity
In relation entity single person place thing data stored
In first step creation database entity unit data classified stated relationship entity
In Open Systems Interconnection model network communication entity active element within subsystem communicates entity using defined protocol
In IBM security product entity user group resource defined RACF
In almost every program element referred entity procedure operator interface block unit symbolic constant statement label

I understand Entity Object Definition XML data represents metadata corresponds DB table
Example I understand Entity Attributes corresponds DB table column
BUT I understand Entity Object Instance
I know corresponds one single row DB table every row different EOI I find
Any example simple explanation would helpful
Entity Object Instance something like row data business logic object oriented representation
Imagine need load data DB table memory need collection row example row object contains property according table column data type value Entity Object Instance something like object item list

Can difference identified reading code
A class template creating object
Not OO language use class see Self Javascript
Typically class implemented object
An object bundle data packaged function act data called method
Calling class constructor allocates memory object initializes member variable
An entity object represents something identity system interested tracking
Typical example Customers Accounts
A value object value identity two instance value considered identical
Typical example monetary amount location payment type
A data transfer object used passing bunch data around
Typically used distributed system send data bundle order avoid repeated network call
Data transfer object identity expectation container data
Generally tell difference entity value object entity recognizable identity system concerned creating storing changing
In case object map database entity primary key either kind composite natural key artificial key value object compared value
In general class construct defines set property Object actual instance class created runtime

An also called graphical representation entity relationship typically used computing regard organization within information system
An entity piece concept data stored
A relationship data shared entity
There three type relationship entity One instance entity A associated one instance another entity B
For example database employee employee name A associated one social security number B
One instance entity A associated zero one many instance another entity B one instance entity B one instance entity A
For example company employee working one building building name A associated many different employee B employee share singular association entity A
One instance entity A associated one zero many instance another entity B one instance entity B associated one zero many instance entity A
For example company employee work multiple project instance employee A associated many instance project B time instance project B multiple employee A associated

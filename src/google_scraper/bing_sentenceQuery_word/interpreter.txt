In directly
instruction written without requiring previously program
An interpreter generally us one following strategy program execution Early version would example first type
example second example third type
Source program compiled ahead time stored machine independent code executed interpreter compiler system
Some system contemporary version may also combine two three
Interpreters various type also constructed many language traditionally associated compilation Algol Fortran Cobol
While interpretation compilation two main mean programming language implemented mutually exclusive interpreting system also perform translation work like compiler
The term signify canonical implementation language interpreter compiler respectively
A ideally independent particular implementation
The first interpreted language
Lisp first implemented computer
Russell read paper realized McCarthy surprise Lisp function could implemented machine code
The result working Lisp interpreter could used run Lisp program properly evaluate Lisp expression
Programs written either directly executed kind interpreter converted compiler execute
While compiler assembler generally produce machine code directly executable computer hardware often optionally produce intermediate form called
This basically machine specific code augmented symbol table name tag make executable block module identifiable relocatable
Compiled program typically use building block function kept library object code module
A used combine library file object file application form single executable file
The object file used generate executable file thus often produced different time sometimes even different language capable generating object format
A simple interpreter written low level language
may similar machine code block implementing function high level language stored executed function entry look table point code
However interpreter written high level language typically us another approach generating walking generating executing intermediate instruction
Thus compiler interpreter generally turn source code text file token may may generate parse tree may generate immediate instruction mean
The basic difference compiler system including built separate linker generates program interpreter system instead action described high level program
A compiler thus make almost conversion source code semantics machine level
program changed interpreter conversion work every time statement function executed
However efficient interpreter much translation work including analysis type similar factored done first time program module function even statement run thus quite akin compiler work
However compiled program still run much faster circumstance part compiler designed optimize code may given ample time
This especially true simpler high level language without many dynamic data structure check
In traditional compilation executable output linkers file file library see picture typically relocatable run general operating system much like object code module difference relocation done dynamically run time
program loaded execution
On hand compiled linked program small typically statically allocated often hard coded memory often secondary storage operating system sense
Historically editor built
This becoming common also compiler often called although programmer prefer use editor choice run compiler linker tool manually
Historically compiler predate interpreter hardware time could support interpreter interpreted code typical batch environment time limited advantage interpretation
During programmer make frequent change source code
When using compiler time change made source code must wait compiler translate altered source file binary code file together program executed
The larger program longer wait
By contrast programmer using interpreter lot le waiting interpreter usually need translate code worked intermediate representation translate thus requiring much le time change tested
Effects evident upon saving source code reloading program
Compiled code generally le readily debugged editing compiling linking sequential process conducted proper sequence proper set command
For reason many compiler also executive aid known file program
The Make file list compiler linker command line program source code file might take simple command line menu input
Make selects third group set instruction issue command compiler linker feeding specified source code file
A convert source code binary instruction specific processor architecture thus making le portable
This conversion made developer environment binary distributed user machine executed without translation
A generate binary code user machine even different processor machine code compiled
An interpreted program distributed source code
It need translated final machine take time make program distribution independent machine architecture
However portability interpreted source code dependent target machine actually suitable interpreter
If interpreter need supplied along source overall installation process complex delivery monolithic executable since interpreter part need installed
The fact interpreted code easily read copied human concern point view
However various system exist
Delivery intermediate code bytecode similar effect obfuscation bytecode could decoded
The main disadvantage interpreter interpreted program typically run slower
The difference speed could tiny great often order magnitude sometimes
It generally take longer run program interpreter run compiled code take le time interpret total time required compile run
This especially important prototyping testing code cycle often much shorter cycle
Interpreting code slower running compiled code interpreter must analyze program time executed perform desired action whereas compiled code performs action within fixed context determined compilation
This analysis known interpretive overhead
Access variable also slower interpreter mapping identifier storage location must done repeatedly rather
There various compromise using interpreter execution speed using compiler
Some system allow interpreted compiled code call share variable
This mean routine tested debugged interpreter compiled thus benefit faster execution routine developed
Many interpreter execute source code stand convert compact internal form
Many interpreter replace single used find instruction
A interpreter interpreter achieve even higher level program compaction using rather program memory structure command token occupy perhaps bit nominally constant stored requiring bit address operand include bit offset
Many BASIC interpreter store read back tokenized internal representation
An interpreter might well use compiler interpret resulting
Example data type definition latter toy interpreter syntax tree obtained C expression shown box
Interpretation used sole method execution even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack code interpreted definition machine code CPU execute
There spectrum possibility interpreting compiling depending amount analysis performed program executed
For example compiled highly compressed optimized representation Lisp source machine code therefore tied particular hardware
This compiled code interpreted bytecode interpreter written
The compiled code case machine code implemented hardware bytecode interpreter
Such compiling interpreter sometimes also called
In bytecode interpreter instruction start byte therefore bytecode interpreter instruction although may used
Some bytecodes may take multiple byte may arbitrarily complicated
necessarily ever need pas compiling phase dictate appropriate algorithmic via customized interpreter similar fashion bytecode interpreter
Threaded code interpreter similar bytecode interpreter instead byte use pointer
Each instruction word point function instruction sequence possibly followed parameter
The threaded code interpreter either loop fetching instruction calling function point fetch first instruction jump every instruction sequence end fetch jump next instruction
Unlike bytecode effective limit number different instruction available memory address space
The classic example threaded code code used system source language compiled F code bytecode interpreted
In spectrum interpreting compiling another approach transform source code optimized abstract syntax tree AST execute program following tree structure use generate native code
In approach sentence need parsed
As advantage bytecode AST keep global program structure relation statement lost bytecode representation compressed provides compact representation
Thus using AST proposed better intermediate format compiler bytecode
Also allows system perform better analysis runtime
However interpreter AST cause overhead bytecode interpreter node related syntax performing useful work le sequential representation requiring traversal pointer overhead visiting tree
Further blurring distinction interpreter bytecode interpreter compilation compilation JIT technique intermediate representation compiled native runtime
This confers efficiency running native code cost startup time increased memory use bytecode AST first compiled
complementary technique interpreter profile running program compiles frequently executed part native code
Both technique decade old appearing language
compilation gained mainstream attention amongst language implementers recent year modern implementation including JITs

Much research particularly reflective interpreter conducted dialect Lisp
In general however language allows writing interpreter
Lisp language Lisp program list symbol list
XSLT language XSLT program written XML
A writing DSLs
Clive Gifford introduced measure quality eigenratio limit ratio computer time spent running stack time spent run stack go infinity
This value depend program run
The book present example Scheme dialect
Other example language
Microcode commonly used technique imposes interpreter hardware architectural level computer
As microcode layer instruction implement instruction internal sequencing many element
Microcode used well specialized processor hardware
Microcode typically resides special memory translates machine instruction data input sequence detailed operation
It separate machine instruction underlying instruction designed altered freely
It also facilitates building complex instruction reducing complexity computer circuit
Writing microcode often called microcode particular processor implementation sometimes called
More extensive microcoding allows small simple powerful architecture wider relatively simple way achieve software compatibility different product processor family

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
Translators usually included within programming convert
Translators
assembler translates assembly language machine code
language written mnemonic closely reflects operation
An interpreter CPU instruction interpreter move translate next instruction
Interpreted code show error soon hit problem easier code
An interpreter create independent final set source code created time run

executes instruction written
There two way program written language
The common program method pas program interpreter
An interpreter translates instruction intermediate form executes
In contrast translates instruction directly
Compiled program generally run faster interpreted program
The advantage interpreter however need go compilation stage machine instruction generated

How work
What difference interpreter compiler
Compilers first sort translator program written
The idea simple You write program hand compiler translates
Then run result
An interpreter also program translates language one moment program run
You write program using text editor something similar instruct interpreter run program
It take program one line time translates line running It translates first line run translates second line run etc
Compiler characteristic Interpreter characteristic An accepts code expressed source language S translates equivalent code expressed another target language An accepts code expressed language S immediately executes code
It work fetching analysing executing one instruction time
Great user entering instruction interactively think Python would like get output putting next instruction
Also useful program executed requires portable
A compiler translates source code machine code execute source object code
An interpreter executes source code one instruction time translate source code
An interpretive compiler good compromise compiler interpreter
It translates source program virtual machine code interpreted
An interpretive compiler combine fast translation moderately fast execution provided Example JDK provides interpretive compiler Java
transforms source code one computer language another one
executes source code directly usually inside virtual machine
Generally interpreter performance costly
What difference interpreter compiler
The translates entire program run
The translates one statement machine language executes proceeds next statement
How work
The Difference v How Work Most program written language c java
language contain understandable word phrase
On hand computer time wrote article understand machine code aka Code
Therefore need convert code source code Machine
Hence word converting
So conclude job Translate code machine code
But different way code Compiler convert source code kind intermediate form
For static language compiler usually convert source code assembly usually get stored disk assembler invoked convert assembly binary code usually stored object file suffix usually linker invoked link object file binary executable
Also common refer whole process compiling assembling linking compiling
So may call gcc compiler actually invokes compiler compile assembler assemble ld linker link
Interpreters language intermediate called bytecode form source code first converted byte code process called compiling
Bytecode run host machine need program actually process viewpoint OS interpret bytecode host machine program called interpreter think java
Some language like python compiling interpreting work single
A compiler computer program transforms translates source code programming language source language another computer language target language
In case compiler used transform source code executable program
translate code programming language low lower level language mostly assembly machine code
An interpreter computer program executes instruction written programming language
It either execute source code directly translates source code first step efficient representation executes code Look book best intro dymanic language realization I found ever c This book center writing interpreter dynamic language Scheme using write interpreter language add tip OOP SmallTalk SOM Simple Object Machine All modern interpreter include compiler inside compile highlevel element portable use JIT compiling machine code RAM
PS If anybody want write SmallTalk system Python please note

Learn basic essay writing guide Extracts document Introduction Compilers Interpreters There two type translator converting language Pascal machine code compiler interpreter
These relieve programmer tedium complexity programming hence make programming considerably easier le error prone
Compiler This type translator take whole source code compiles object code
The object code sometimes called machine code run
Pascal example programming language us compilation
Interpreter This type translator take source code translates first line program executes
It second line third line get end code
BASIC LISP Prolog APL example programming language us interpretation
Compilers plus Interpreters
Some program written language JAVA compiled interpreted
A program firstly compiled code
It distributed user use wide range computer Mac PCs
These computer run convert compiled code code use
Languages JAVA said program written language run machine
These type language ideal use Internet know anything machine running code
Compilation interpretation compared Compilation much faster interpretation
Once compilation process completed object code run much faster interpreted code
Middle The lexical analyser add Item Name Run Time Value
The common way organising symbol table use hash table
The identifier hashed memory location
Semantic Analysis It concerned meaning interpretation word context used
For example A B may correct PASCAL statement possible assign B A A integer variable B character variable
Semantic analysis check statement correct meaning
Examples Are parameter argument type subprogram compatible
b Do number parameter argument match
c In assignment statement type LHS RHS compatible
In natual language example English sentence may also syntactically correct sematically meaningless
For example man eats apple meaning obeys rule language whereas apple eats man obeys rule language syntax semantics
Syntactic correctness imply semantic correctness
Code Generation Source code first passed lexical analysis program syntax analysis program
It given code generation program actually produce object code
A high level language first LEXICALLY analysed
Then SYNTAX analysed
During syntax analysis SEMANTICS code checked see make sense
If error found stage REPORT GENERATOR program spring action display helpful helpful Conclusion A library file contains collection object file
The linkage editor manage file link program necessary
In order link object file file copied memory
It also necessary copy executable file memory executed
When program code copied memory said code loaded memory
The program performs task called loader
The loader usually integral part linkage editor
Loader A program loaded memory library program known loader
There two type loader Absolute loader It load program single fixed area memory
All address reference program fixed translation time program assembled compiled work properly loaded one specific position main memory
b Relocating loader It load program anywhere main memory program translated way address relative start program
The start address program held special register called base register
There two basic form relocatable object program prepared
For first form static relocation object program loaded main memory relocatability lost process moved
For second form dynamic relocation relocatability retained process may moved different memory execution essential program constantly swapped memory

We generally write computer program using language
A language one understandable u human
It contains word phrase English language
But computer understand language
It understands program written binary called machine code
A program written language called source code
We need convert source code machine code accomplished compiler interpreter

In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

In refers process construction application generated computerized
This involves use algorithm mathematical technique allow large quantity data aggregated
When pattern correlation used identify represent people called
Other discussion profiling notion profiling sense construction profile also concern individual case price discrimination identification security risk
Profiling simply matter computerized enables refined extensive
machine profiling constitutes precondition emerging infrastructure envisioned advocate
One challenging problem involves dealing increasing
With sort content well improvement drop cost recording technology amount available information become enormous increase exponentially
It thus become important company government individual discriminate detecting useful interesting data
The development profiling technology must seen background
These technology thought efficiently collect analyse data order find test knowledge form statistical pattern data
This process called KDD provides profiler set correlated data usable profile
The technical process profiling separated several step Data collection preparation mining belong phase profile construction
However profiling also refers application profile meaning usage profile identification categorization group individual person
As seen step six application process circular
There feedback loop construction application profile
The interpretation profile lead reiterant possibly specific previous step profiling process
The application profile people whose data used construct profile based data matching provides new data allows adjustment
The process profiling dynamic adaptive
A good illustration dynamic adaptive nature profiling Standard Process Data Mining
In order clarify nature profiling technology crucial distinction made different type profiling practice apart distinction construction application profile
The main distinction profiling supervised unsupervised learning individual group profile
Profiles classified according way generated
On one hand profile generated testing hypothesized correlation
This called profiling
This similar methodology traditional scientific research start hypothesis consists testing validity
The result type profiling verification refutation hypothesis
One could also speak deductive profiling
On hand profile generated exploring data base using data mining process detect pattern data base previously hypothesized
In way matter generating hypothesis finding correlation one expect even think
Once pattern mined enter loop described tested use new data
This called
Two thing important regard distinction
First unsupervised learning algorithm seem allow construction new type knowledge based hypothesis developed researcher based causal motivational relation exclusively based stochastical correlation
Second unsupervised learning algorithm thus seem allow inductive type knowledge construction require theoretical justification causal explanation
Some author claim application profile based computerized stochastical pattern recognition
allows reliable prediction future behaviour theoretical causal explanation pattern matter anymore
However idea algorithm provide reliable information imply information neutral
In process collecting aggregating data database first three step process profile construction translation made event
These data prepared cleansed allow initial computability
Potential bias located point well choice algorithm developed
It possible mine database possible linear correlation meaning mathematical technique developed search pattern determinate pattern found
In case machine profiling potential bias informed common sense prejudice psychologist call stereotyping computer technique employed initial step process
These technique mostly invisible profile applied data match relevant group profile
Profiles must also classified according kind subject refer
This subject either individual group people
When profile constructed data single person called individual profiling
This kind profiling used discover particular characteristic certain individual enable unique identification provision personalized service
However personalized servicing often also based group profiling allows categorisation person certain type person based fact profile match profile constructed basis massive amount data massive number people
A group profile refer result data mining data set refer existing community considers like religious group tennis club university political party etc
In case describe previously unknown pattern behaviour characteristic group community
A group profile also refer category people form community found share previously unknown pattern behaviour characteristic
In case group profile describes specific behaviour characteristic category people like instance woman blue eye red hair adult relatively short arm leg
These category may found correlate health risk earning capacity mortality rate credit risk etc
If individual profile applied individual mined direct individual profiling
If group profile applied individual whose data match profile indirect individual profiling profile generated using data people
Similarly group profile applied group mined direct group profiling
However far application group profile group implies application group profile individual member group make sense speak indirect group profiling especially group profile
Group profile also divided term distributive character
A group profile distributive property apply equally member group bachelor unmarried person specific gene chance contract specific disease
A profile profile necessarily apply member group group person specific postal code average earning capacity XX category person blue eye average chance contract specific disease
Note case chance individual particular earning capacity contract specific disease depend factor
sex age background parent previous health education
It obvious apart tautological profile like bachelor group profile generated mean computer technique
This implication accuracy indirect individual profiling based data matching group profile
Quite apart fact application accurate profile may unfair cause undue stigmatisation group profile accurate
Profiling technology applied variety different domain variety purpose
These profiling practice different effect raise different issue
Knowledge behaviour preference customer great interest commercial sector
On basis profiling technology company predict behaviour different type customer
Marketing strategy tailored people fitting type
Examples profiling practice marketing customer general personalized advertising
In financial sector institution use profiling technology
Banks want minimise risk giving credit customer
On basis extensive group profiling customer assigned certain scoring value indicates creditworthiness
Financial institution like bank insurance company also use group profiling detect fraud
Databases transaction searched algorithm find behaviour deviate standard indicating potentially suspicious transaction
In context employment profile use tracking employee monitoring online behaviour detection fraud deployment human resource pooling ranking skill
Profiling also used support people work also learning intervening design system personalising interaction
For instance useful supporting
In possibility exists linking different database case suspect mining common pattern
This could used solving existing case purpose establishing risk profile potential suspect
Profiling technology raised host ethical legal issue including
Numerous author warned affordances new technological infrastructure could emerge basis profiling technology
Privacy one principal issue raised
Profiling technology make possible monitoring individual behaviour preference
Profiles may reveal personal private information individual might even aware
Profiling technology nature discriminatory tool
They allow unparalleled kind social sorting segmentation could unfair effect
The people profiled may pay higher price could miss important offer opportunity may run increased risk catering need le profitable
In case aware since profiling practice mostly invisible profile often protected intellectual property trade secret
This pose threat equality solidarity citizen
On larger scale might cause segmentation society
One problem underlying potential violation privacy process profiling often invisible profiled
This creates difficulty becomes hard impossible contest application particular group profile
This disturbs principle due process person access information basis withheld benefit attributed certain risk contest way treated
Profiles used people end hand people entitled access use
An important issue related breach security
When application profile cause harm liability harm determined held accountable
Is software programmer profiling service provider profiled user held accountable
This issue liability especially complex case application decision profile also become automated like decision automated decision based profiling

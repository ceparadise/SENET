A computer science specifying symbol substitution recursively performed generate new symbol sequence
A finite set production main component specification specifically
The component finite set finite set known alphabet distinguished symbol start symbol
In production form arbitrary string terminal nonterminals however may empty string
If empty string denoted symbol rather leave side blank
So production form operator denotes
The type formal grammar impose additional restriction constitutes production
Notably side production must single nonterminal symbol
So production form To generate string language one begin string consisting single successively applies rule number time order rewrite string
This stop obtain string containing terminal
The language consists string generated manner
Any particular sequence legal choice taken rewriting process yield one particular string language
If multiple different way generating single string grammar said
For example assume alphabet consists start symbol following rule start choose rule apply
If choose rule replace obtain string
If choose rule replace obtain string
This process repeated symbol alphabet
If choose rule replace obtain string done
We write series choice briefly using symbol
The language grammar set string generated using process

Although philosophical community agreed Putnam claim natural language speak affect thought clear programming language use affect solve problem
The traditional aphorism view
Strong computer science student therefore regularly look learn new language
This page provides quick list programming language SamR think learn
dialect Lisp
The functional paradigm incredibly powerful approach expressing algorithm
The ability design control structure use technique empowers programmer many way
The functional paradigm also increasingly relevant
For example Amazon Google use core technique much work large data set modern language seem include functional component
As importantly Scheme syntax easily let treat expression either data code
Being able switch model transformative way think program

Being able program C mean start approach code level close machine ca program well C unless understand memory arrangement
There argument student longer need handle thing level clearly write program quickly use language
Nonetheless understanding pointer data representation useful
C syntax also influence large number language


Postscript language think reverse Polish notation steroid focus making image
You need deep understanding Postscript
But working language model fairly simple syntax really transform thinking
Plus get make cool image

Some modern scripting language

These programming language markup language
But know least one markup language
Knowing HTML also let quick Web consulting job
Yeah practical issue

Like HTML TeX LaTex markup language programming language

Page Validation verification two way check data entered computer correct
entered incorrectly little use
automatic computer check ensure data entered sensible reasonable
It check accuracy data
For example secondary school student likely aged
The computer programmed accept number
This check
However guarantee number typed correct
For example student age might entered valid incorrect
There number validation type used check data entered
Page Activity Find validating verifying data
Links Bringing gadget galore

Verification something correct conforms certain standard
In data collection process ensuring data entered fall within accepted boundary collecting data
For example collecting last name entered program validates letter entered number survey collecting data form yes question program validates response used word
Validation procedure typically written program therefore invisible user

In process ensuring undergone ensure correct useful
It us routine often called validation constraint check routine check correctness meaningfulness security data input system
The rule may implemented automated facility inclusion explicit validation logic
Data validation intended provide certain guarantee fitness accuracy consistency various kind user input application automated system
Data validation rule defined designed using various methodology deployed various context
Data validation rule may defined designed deployed example For business application data validation defined rule
Data conform rule negatively affect business process execution
Therefore data validation start business process definition set business rule within process
Rules collected requirement capture exercise
In evaluating basic data validation generalization made regarding different type validation according scope complexity purpose various validation operation carried
For example Data type validation customarily carried one simple data field
The simplest kind data type validation verifies individual character provided user input consistent expected character one known primitive data type defined programming language data storage retrieval mechanism well specification following primitive data type integer float decimal string
For example many database system allow specification following l plus minus parenthesis
A sophisticated data validation routine would check see user entered valid country code number digit entered matched convention country area specified
A validation process involves two distinct step Validation Check b action
The check step us one computational rule see section determine data valid
The action sends feedback help enforce validation
Simple range constraint validation may examine user input consistency range consistency test evaluating sequence character one test regular expression
Code validation includes test data type validation combined one operation verify data consistent one external rule requirement validity constraint relevant particular organization context set underlying assumption
These additional validity constraint may involve supplied data known table directory information service
For example experienced user may enter string match specification valid address defined string might actually correspond resolvable domain connected active account
Structured validation allows combination various basic data type validation step along complex processing
Such complex processing may include testing conditional constraint entire complex data object set process operation within system
A Validation rule criterion constraint used process carried data encoded onto input medium involves data vet validation program
This distinct operation program determined intended meet purpose
The Validation rule check system still used many major software manufacturer designed employee Microsoft time
The method check data fall appropriate parameter defined system analyst
A judgement whether data valid made possible validation program ensure complete accuracy
This achieved use clerical computer control built system design stage
The difference data validity accuracy illustrated trivial example
A company established Personnel file record contains field Job Grade
The permitted value A B C An entry record may valid accepted system one character may correct grade individual worker concerned
Whether grade correct established clerical check reference file
During system design therefore data definition established place limit constitutes valid data
Using data definition range software validation check carried
An example validation check procedure used verify
Failures omission data validation lead
Data validation check data fit purpose valid sensible reasonable secure processed

This action might possible undo

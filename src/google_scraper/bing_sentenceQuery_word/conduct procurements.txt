Uphold organization standard policy relevant legislation
Avoid conflict interest
Organizations profession often seek address standard conduct adoption code conduct
Professional code conduct generally written broad conceptual term rather specific situational descriptive term
They leave room interpretation often may seem ambiguous
Procurement professional abide merely letter law specific word code rather guided spirit law broader concept code intended express
One reason many procuring organization avoid detailed specific code may give impression anything prohibited permitted anything specifically addressed important
People profession trained appreciative procurement ethic may realize situation specifically identified code may still vitally important
Those understand foundation general requirement may able apply code specific situation
No matter hard try never specify law code regulation rule written requirement everything procurement officer need know regarding allowed appropriate prohibited shunned
It necessary procurement officer understand law rule intended accomplish
The primary UN system regulation rule ethic behavioural standard contained Bulletin Status Basic Rights Duties United Nations Staff Members well Standards Conduct International Civil Service Jan
See Annexes
The United Nations Oath Office see clearly express UN value principle rule regulation procurement officer regulate conduct perform duty within interest UN
The respective FRR guiding procurement process UN organization also address several ethical value fairness integrity transparency equal treatment
According The concise Oxford dictionary current English steward person employed manage another When steward UN staff member person whose property steward managing consists entire world population immense responsibility
Spending money come Member States variety public source special kind stewardship international procurement officer entrusted
They must spend UN money way meant spent must deviate procedure suit convenience
All UN official required display utmost loyalty United Nations Charter rule regulation respective personal preference gain
This requirement straightforward unbending
However exercising high standard professional responsibility expected UN staff member always easy
It requires UN staff member exercise clear judgement every day conforming professional practice outside relationship spirit letter prescribed rule regulation well broader harder define ethical standard
UN procurement officer face highly competing pressure
The pressure satisfy demand quicker turnaround better quality lower price procurement compete pressure fulfil duty utmost responsibility ethical standard
It therefore main role UN procurement officer execute procurement function according highest standard professionalism respect value objective interest organization
This implies procurement officer must adhere principle fairness impartiality transparency stewardship avoid conflict interest impropriety respect apply organization relevant policy rule procedure
Some ethical concept principle relate procurement process loyalty respect rule regulation integrity impartiality fairness transparency confidentiality avoidance appearance impropriety due diligence
UN procurement officer charged highest standard loyalty discretion
When undersigning Oath Office UN staff member promise


exercise loyalty discretion conscience function entrusted international civil servant United Nations discharge function regulate conduct interest United Nations view seek accept instruction regard performance duty Government authority external Article United Nations Charter requires UN staff member refrain action might reflect position international official responsible Article Para
United Nations Charter state paramount consideration employment staff determination condition service shall necessity securing highest standard efficiency competency In summary UN procurement officer Stand decision organization interest even unpopular
Understand rule regulation pertaining profession organization
Know rule regulation necessary
Know caused rule regulation enacted
Respect need formality rule regulation
Interpret apply rule accordance intent
Be able perform procurement responsibility effectively efficiently still abide pertinent rule
Permitted exception requirement kept minimum fully justified documented
If rule regulation must reconsidered changed procurement officer pursue appropriate process submit recommended revision established channel include complete documentation explain justify proposed change
During process existing regulation rule procedure must followed
The procurement officer must perform regulated task consistently according specified procedure take leadership role help stakeholder understand follow well
UN procurement officer expected maintain superior standard integrity moral value
The International Civil Service Advisory Board identifies integrity one fundamental paramount standard conduct underlined Article United Nations Charter explicit implicit corresponding article basic instrument specialized Their report explains Integrity perhaps subject exhaustive precise definition must judged basis total behaviour person concerned
Such elementary personal private quality honesty truthfulness fidelity probity freedom corrupting influence clearly included
For international official however Charter also requires integrity public official especially international public official
Perhaps clearest expression fact dedicated regulate conduct interest international organization view
It follows must subordinate private interest avoid placing position interest would conflict interest organization The concept integrity enshrined Charter United Nations embrace aspect behaviour international civil servant including quality honesty truthfulness impartiality incorruptibility
These quality basic competence efficiency also enshrined Cultural difference including nationality ethnicity industry profession must set aside
Generic principle integrity extend beyond rise difference must allowed prevail especially connection business transaction conducted UN procurement officer
Integrity procurement officer international marketplace mean believing public trust important compromised
A procurement officer therefore demonstrate integrity Upholding principle United Nations Charter
Demonstrating value UN including impartiality fairness honesty truthfulness daily activity behaviour
Acting without consideration personal gain
Resisting undue political pressure decision making
Not abusing power authority
Taking prompt action case unprofessional unethical behaviour
In report International Civil Service Advisory Board impartiality feature key requirement
The report state Impartiality implies objectivity lack bias tolerance restraint particularly political religious dispute difference arise
The staff member personal view conviction remain inviolate freedom private person take side enter dispute partisan publicly express conviction matter controversial nature either singly member group
Just practice impartiality strengthen secretariat repeated instance partiality bias serious harm organization
According The concise Oxford dictionary current English fair defined unbiased equitable accordance rule
In context impartiality fairness accordance definition procurement officer Set aside personal organizational bias
Apply standard evaluation supplier equal treatment
For example one supplier request additional information supplier receive information time
Or one offer disqualified evaluation process award placed next highest priced offer reason disqualifying lower offer must applied evaluation uniformly
Fairness implies reasonable well impartial treating UN trading partner professional businesslike courtesy well strict adherence policy procedure conducting transaction
Transparency mean unimpeded visibility
Because public procurement involves use accountability public fund transparency perhaps paramount procurement activity
All transaction subject scrutiny organization experience scrutiny degree UN
Therefore procurement officer assistant must always conduct way scrutiny would damage UN leader member organization staff programme
There two degree transparency internal scrutiny external scrutiny
Internal scrutiny transparency within UN examination conducted internal auditor
It seek ascertain compliance UN standard UN compliance officer
External scrutiny transparency outside UN examination Member States press external auditor outside observer
It refers notion almost anyone observe UN activity watch UN conduct business
Only something truly confidential nature proprietary data belonging supplier proposal evaluated prior contract award confidentiality given higher priority transparency still maintaining overall transparent process
Even though detail pricing data trade secret may held confidential procurement officer always assume work available public
Confidentiality need extra consideration UN procurement due delicate nature information handled procurement process pricing product marketing strategy etc
A breach confidentiality data handled procurement process could result discredit UN distrust government partner supplier
The concept confidentiality repeated several instance Code Conduct documented Standards Conduct International Civil Service Regulation V
It state Staff member shall exercise utmost discretion regard matter official business
They shall communicate Government model person source information known reason official position know ought known made public except appropriate normal course duty authorisation Secretary General
These obligation cease upon separation The disclosure information may seriously jeopardise efficiency credibility organization
International Civil Servants responsible exercising discretion matter official business
They must divulge confidential information without authorisation
Nor international civil servant use information made public known virtue official position private advantage
These obligation cease upon separation Confidentially might seem contradiction transparency mean way overall procurement process conducted need clear transparent truly proprietary data need remain confidential
In private sector appearance tempered wish standard organization leadership
Employee behaviour judged according legality satisfaction owner customer
However international procurement officer must adhere conservative standard
UN procurement officer must constantly aware action appear outside observer
Observers may understand pressure profession
UN procurement officer always behave way observer could misconstrue action improper
This added dimension appearance impropriety place extra responsibility procurement professional
What people think observing UN staff member trivial
What people think procurement officer behaviour basis major scandal based misunderstanding erroneous information damage organization effectiveness achieving mission
In international arena damage immense even unthinkable
Acting properly technical sense enough avoiding even appearance impropriety also necessary
This appearance must anticipated conservative term considering varied culture observe UN activity
UN staff member almost environment strongly advised avoid appearance
The newspaper full story people avoid appearance impropriety
Not society standard tradition proper
It important recognise cultural difference appearance anticipate conservative term might perceived improper conduct conservative mean thing staff different culture
Due diligence context UN procurement refers carrying duty carefully thoroughly avoiding careless practice technique
Due diligence requires activity procurement officer pursued manner go beyond minimum effort
For example diligent UN procurement officer check reference potential supplier develop impartial evaluation criterion carefully analyse offer received cut corner sake convenience
Some common ethical risk procurement process include conflict interest fraud corruption coercion collusion
A common risk situation related ethic procurement risk conflict interest
Conflict interest defined direct mutually exclusive clash interest UN private personal interest UN procurement officer
The Standards Conduct International Civil Service standard conduct state Staff member shall use office knowledge gained official function private gain financial otherwise private gain third party Staff member shall actively associated management hold financial interest business concern possible staff member business concern benefit association financial interest reason position United Nations A staff member occasion deal official capacity matter involving business concern hold financial interest directly indirectly shall disclose measure interest except otherwise authorized either dispose financial interest formally excuse participating regard involvement matter give rise conflict In context procurement UN procurement officer Declare immediate effect potential conflict interest
Not use information obtained professional reason personal profit
Disclose dispose financial interest involved
Not participate conflicting procurement process
Excuse withdraw procurement process procurement officer may conflicting interest
It good practice official involved procurement process including participating offer opening panel evaluation committee contract committee sign advance duty declaration conflict interest
Honesty truthfulness impartiality incorruptibility applied whenever conflict interest appearance conflict interest arises course conducting procurement
A common conflict interest situation UN procurement officer face whether accept gift supplier partner government
Offering gift customer common practice private sector
It marketing strategy based universal sense reciprocity receive something feel obliged give something exchange
thing like free lunch
Suppliers often offer different type gift example perishable product hospitality free training course experience like exhibition fair trade sometimes kind donation etc
related activity specific UN organization
Identifying covert gift always easy especially time example training activity may seen beneficial organization however careful review impact taken account would receiving gift benefit one company others
Would acceptance fair competitor
In case content training event deemed appropriate beneficial organization technical sense self financial support
travel expense considered
It difficult judge behave particular situation would appropriate action
The table provides example good practice If gift Low value
chocolate given end year Accept tell supplier shared colleague office
High value
gold watch Return thank supplier say allowed accept
Relatively high value
good bottle wine given end year Thank supplier tell put lottery policy organization drawn
Sent private address Immediately return supplier tell supplier unacceptable practice send gift UN staff member private address
In context gift gratuity standard conduct state No staff member shall accept honour decoration favour gift remuneration No staff member shall accept honour decoration favour gift remuneration source without first obtaining approval A UN procurement officer Be able identify covert gift
Not accept gift governmental non governmental source report designated authority
Be aware reason accepting benefit
Be aware impact organization accepting benefit

Buyers make personal gain expense supplier
Corruption mean practice offering giving receiving soliciting directly indirectly anything value influence action public official competitive selection process contract execution
There two common type corruption Approach Includes Direct Cash paid procurement officer settle buyer personal debt paid third party buyer benefit
Cheques paid directly buyer member family paid business buyer interest
Cheques paid settle buyer personal debt
Shares share option
Free discounted good service

Inside information benefit buyer
Threats blackmail violence
Free travel expense visit exhibition visit supplier factory
Invitation entertainment event
Coercion mean harming threatening harm directly indirectly person property influence participation procurement process affect execution contract
Collusion mean scheme arrangement two supplier without knowledge UN organisation designed establish price artificial level
Some potential area risk relating ethic procurement cycle listed table
Area risk Explanation example Budgeting Fraud corruption must paid somewhere
Lack proper budgetary control example fund allocated specific purpose provide necessary fund
Financial approval policy Without regular audit strict management control opportunity fraudulent use person level authority misusing someone else
Perceived need Requirements invented falsified
Specification development Specifications written favour specific supplier
Clarifications specification provided one invitee tendering process
Evaluation criterion Evaluation criterion written amended receipt offer favour particular supplier
This process used limit field competition give favoured supplier advantage
Invitation This process used give illusion competition really exists inviting tender company known unsatisfactory sending complete specification tender time etc
Offer evaluation Fraud stage occurs mainly objective evaluation criterion agreed advance
It also occur technical staff able use specialist knowledge mislead member evaluation team
Negotiation Favoured supplier assisted given useful information negotiation
Contract award There opportunity fraud supplier either deliberately fraudulent act buyer incompetence
Post award change specification This allows supplier increase profit particularly awarded contract attractively low offer price
Goods receipt Examples Allowing good specification drafting false good inward note deliberate ordering allowing inventory dwindle emergency order higher price processed
Invoice certification Deliberate overcharging backdating order allow benefit price change paying twice failing insist monitor retention
Decentralized procurement organization In decentralized organization responsibility delegated large number people difficult central procurement function exercise total control aware going decentralized unit
Although decentralisation often improve efficiency reduce cost also increase risk corruption
There typical sign may indicate warn unethical practice
These include limited following deviation correct procedure overcharging supplier poor record keeping missing file poor separation duty example person issue order approves payment poor control example one person sign contract buyer extravagant life style buyer frequent absence office excessive entertaining supplier resistance audit reluctance delegate excessive secrecy dictatorial management style unnecessary meeting supplier allowing staff deal certain supplier established supplier reluctance entering competitive tendering supplier cartel

Managers also point correct behaviour employee draw line acceptable unacceptable behaviour
Management also ultimately responsible operation asset command
It responsibility interest ensure organization necessary procedure control system place ensure maximum security minimize risk corruption fraud
All organization develop code ethic staff follow
A code ethic formalized statement containing ethical code conduct organization member follow
The Code Ethics clearly state type behaviour expected member type behaviour unacceptable

Education training Awareness training clarify meant ethical conduct short cut fraud contribute prevention fraud
Training program supported booklet organization business ethic security policy article internal newsletter magazine newsletter including report fraud discovered lesson learned well film video
New employee induction training cover security
Investigation Set organizational rule conducting investigation suspected reported incident fraud breach security including employee obligation assist investigation
Criminal offence reason disciplinary action brought attention staff
The integrity accounting system essential element preventing fraud
Controls ensure detail good equipment moving organization recorded serially numbered document computer record copy document recording movement retained securely
Maximum use made numerical control using document serial number
Levels authority approve accounting transaction clearly defined regularly audited
Each system define held responsible loss error concealment
Areas responsibility identified enforced
Books record protected way asset organization
This basic one effective way preventing fraud since remove possibility closed loop one person authority budget provision order pay
Each transaction divided number stage one person ever authority handle stage
Control system procurement protect honest buyer supplier false accusation dishonesty encourage work honestly effectively prevent detect corruption
It often difficult get right balance many organization control system either restrictive lax
An effective control system need flexible allowing honest buyer supplier operate efficiently time minimising risk dishonesty
Procurement procedure set manual provided staff involved procurement
Procedures authority responsibility penalty adhering procedure clearly defined
When setting strategy particular procurement following factor taken account The threshold contract order must put competitive tender clearly defined enforced
As far possible spot emergency order avoided
contract avoided possible avoided special care taken verify supplier expense
The policy financial approval procurement action clearly communicated relevant staff

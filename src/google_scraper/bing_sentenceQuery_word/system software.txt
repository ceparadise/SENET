A machine language consists group signifying processor instruction change state computer preceding state
For example instruction may change value stored particular storage location effect directly observable user
An instruction may also indirectly cause something appear display computer state change visible user
The processor carry instruction order provided unless instructed interrupted dominant core run instruction order however application software run one core default software made run many
The majority software written easier efficient programmer use closer machine language

An outline would first piece software written century planned
However neither Analytical Engine software ever created
The first theory creation computer know proposed Alan Turing essay decision problem
This eventually led creation twin academic field computer science software engineering study software creation
Computer science theoretical Turing essay example computer science software engineering focus practical concern
However prior software understand stored memory digital yet exist
The first electronic computing device instead rewired order reprogram
On virtually computer platform software grouped broad category
Based goal computer software divided Programming tool also software form program application also known use create

Software written one programming language many programming language existence least one implementation consists set programming tool
These tool may relatively program combined together accomplish task may form IDE combine much functionality tool
IDEs may either invoking relevant individual tool functionality new way
An IDE make easier specific task searching file particular project
Many programming language implementation provide option using individual tool IDE
Users often see thing differently programmer
People use modern general purpose computer opposed usually see three layer software performing variety task platform application user software
Computer software loaded
Once software loaded computer able software
This involves passing system software hardware ultimately receives instruction
Each instruction cause computer carry carrying altering instruction
Data movement typically one place memory another
Sometimes involves moving data memory register enable data access CPU
Moving data especially large amount costly
So sometimes avoided using pointer data instead
Computations include simple operation incrementing value variable data element
More complex computation may involve many operation data element together
Software quality important especially system software like
If software faulty buggy delete person work crash computer unexpected thing
Faults error called often discovered alpha beta testing
Software often also victim known progressive performance degradation resulting combination unseen bug
Many bug discovered eliminated debugged
However software testing every bug programmer say every program least one bug Lubarsky Law
In method software development separate testing team typically employed newer approach collectively termed developer often testing demonstrate software regularly obtain feedback
Software tested method done manually commonly automatically since amount code tested quite large
For instance extremely rigorous software testing procedure many operating system communication function
Many operation interact identify command program
This enables many people work NASA check evaluate functional system overall
Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering system operation function much easier together
The software license give user right use software licensed environment case also grant right right make copy
divided two type hand come granting recipient right modify redistribute software
Software patent like type patent theoretically supposed give inventor exclusive license piece software component piece software
Ideas useful thing software could user supposed patentable concrete implementation
actual software package implementing patent supposed patentable latter already covered copyright generally automatically
So software patent supposed cover middle area requirement concrete implementation
In country requirement claimed invention effect physical world may also part requirement software patent held since useful software effect physical world requirement may open debate
Meanwhile American copyright law applied various aspect writing software code
Software patent controversial software industry many people holding different view
One source controversy aforementioned split initial idea patent seem honored practice patent example patent AOP purported claim right programming tool implementing idea AOP howsoever implemented
Another source controversy effect innovation many distinguished expert company arguing software field software patent merely create vast additional litigation cost risk actually retard innovation
In case debate software patent outside United States argument made large American corporation patent lawyer likely primary beneficiary allowing continue allow software patent
Design implementation software varies depending complexity software
For instance design creation took much time designing developing latter much basic functionality
Software usually designed created aka IDE like simplify process software applicable
As noted different section software usually created top existing software API underlying software provides like JavaBeans
Libraries APIs categorized purpose
For instance used implementing library used designing graphical user interface GUI application like used designing
When program designed relies upon API
For instance user designing Microsoft Windows desktop application might use Windows Forms library design desktop application call APIs like close open application write additional operation need
Without APIs programmer need write APIs
Companies like provide APIs many application written using usually numerous APIs
useful creating software
Computer software special economic characteristic make design creation distribution different economic good
A person creates software called term similar meaning
More informal term programmer also exist coder although use latter word may cause confusion often used mean
A great variety software company programmer world comprise software industry
Software quite profitable industry richest person world largely due ownership significant number share Microsoft company responsible software product

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

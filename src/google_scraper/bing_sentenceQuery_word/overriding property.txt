In recent JavaScript interview I asked overloading v overriding
I know concept Java But something similar JavaScript would code example
My understanding overloading common javascript
Why would need use overloading JS
OverRiding bit clearer example riding would subclassing inheriting super class riding create unique one sub class
JavaScript support overloading
JavaScript support overriding define two function name last one defined override previously defined version every time call made function last defined one get executed
read There nice example JavaScript function overloading You basically use parameter function take object object contains number parameter want
It actually overloading obviously cause possible JavaScript
need traditional concept overload javascript dynamic nature
In traditional programming language Java define method multiple time different signature language correctly use method want call using signature thats called overload method
On hand override possibility redefine method parent class child class
To overload javascript common practice use last parameter called option
For example option javascript object prop want pas
Then use called option pattern check prop
To override difficult pure javascript prototypal nature language extend base object new one use function constructor object passing decorate newly created object parent prop
While JavaScript support overloading traditional sense More required argument may passed time JavaScript method accessed argument variable
This functionally similar

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

Overriding programming feature enables child class provide different implementation method already defined implemented parent class one parent class
The overriden method child class name signature parameter one parent class
Overriding enables handling different data type uniform interface
Hence generic method could defined parent class child class provides specific implementation method
The invoked method version determined class object
If child class object used invoke method child class version method executed
If parent class object used invoke method parent class version method executed
The invoked method determined runtime whereas overloading invoked method determined compile time
C support overriding explicitly using keywords
Java us keyword invoke superclass method
However super keyword us instead base class name followed scope resolution operator

I Base class And following descendant When I compile I get warning saying Derived class definition gon na hide Base version
Is possible override property c like method
You need use keyword define abstract property use keyword child If NOT going override use keyword method hide parent definition
Make base property abstract override use new keyword derived class
Or Change property signature shown If need implementation Base class use abstract property
I would suggest using property rather trhowing NotImplemented exception getter modifier force derived class implement property end safe solution
In case write derived class difference two abstract force derived class implement something virtaul provide default behavior deriver use change

A OOP associated
An object mostly made data behavior form interface object present outside world
Data represented object behavior method
For example object would method state whether opened closed would property
In method defined object instance given class
One important capability method provides method overriding
The name used multiple different kind class
This allows sending object invoke behavior delegate implementation behavior receiving object
A method Java programming set behavior class object
For example object send message another object appropriate formula invoked whether receiving object etc
Methods also provide interface class use access modify data object
This known encapsulation
Encapsulation overriding two primary distinguishing feature method procedure call
overloading two significant way method differs conventional procedure function call
Overriding refers subclass redefining implementation method superclass
For example may method defined shape class
The various subclass etc
would define appropriate formula calculate area
The idea look object black box change internals object made minimal impact object use
This known encapsulation meant make code easier maintain
Method overloading hand refers differentiating code used handle message based parameter method
If one view receiving object first parameter method overriding special case overloading selection based first argument
The following simple example illustrates difference Accessor method used read data value object
Mutator method used modify data object
Manager method used initialize destroy object class
constructor destructors
These method provide facilitates
For example class provides accessor method retrieve current rather directly accessing balance data field later code implement complex mechanism balance retrieval fetch without dependent code needing changed
The concept encapsulation modularity unique programming
Indeed many way approach simply logical extension previous paradigm
A method called beginning object lifetime create initialize object process called
Initialization may include acquisition resource
Constructors may parameter usually return value language
See following example Java A method called automatically end object lifetime process called
Destruction language allow destructor method argument return value
Destruction implemented perform cleanup chore task object destruction
In language destructors known
They similar purpose function destructors difference language utilize language manual memory management sequence called different
An one
It often used specify subclass must provide implementation method
Abstract method used specify computer language
The following code show abstract class need extended The following subclass extends main class Class method method called rather instance
They typically used part object
class defined instance class object created
allow class created deleted
In sense provide functionality constructor destructors described
But language allows developer dynamically alter object model run time create new class redefine class hierarchy modify property etc
Special method language may support none special method defined
A language compiler may automatically generate default special method programmer may allowed optionally define special method
Most special method directly called rather compiler generates code call appropriate time
Static method meant relevant instance class rather specific instance
They similar static variable sense
An example would static method sum value variable every instance class
For example class might static method compute average price product
In Java commonly used static method This static method owning object run instance
It receives information argument
A static method invoked even instance class exist yet
Static method called static resolved compile time based class called dynamically case instance method resolved polymorphically based runtime type object
operator define action performed compiler class object assigned class object type
Operator method define operation performed symbol associated method parameter
Example Some procedural language extended capability leverage large skill set legacy code language still provide benefit development
Perhaps example extension programming language
Due design requirement add paradigm existing procedural language message passing unique capability terminology
For example method known

Martin year experience Human Resources Information Systems PhD Information Technology Management Want watch later
One huge feature Java language concept ability create child class main class inherit variable method parent
For example class want make class simply create subclass inherits property variable method within class
The class method calculating overtime variable within new child class
Here brief example child class
Let say like overtime calculation method want add one like subtracts weekly candy bar allowance overtime
The current method work fine wo mess
Instead method
When perform override actually creating new method exact name
We different code within method otherwise use parent method
Remember new method MUST new child class created
Note method name return different value
It still double different math going
Remember override override parent class method
Because created child class inherits method parent
A method name parent override parent class
So still want reference method parent class
Now override method free use new code
But may also employee candy bar allowance need run original calculation method
To reference parent class method use keyword Get FREE access day create account
Let look full block code
Yes lot going
The main method creates instance class
Each method called even though method name result different method overridden
Here code And output different Java support overriding method powerful see code example
Although overriding fairly simple exercise provides many opportunity
For example could child class inherit perform method different calculation
method great tool Java toolbox
It also part overall idea child class inheriting method variable parent class
When override method using method parent class performing different task method
If need reference method parent class use keyword

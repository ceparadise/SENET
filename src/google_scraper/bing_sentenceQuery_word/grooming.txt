Computer science surprisingly difficult thing define
If search web turn quite definition computer science
Some people take academic approach say What heck mean
Other people define term believe saying thing like
None definition attempt defining computer science sit well
So might thinking care What matter computer science Well reason matter many u programmer software developer either degree computer science studying get degree computer science simply associate knowledge field computer science
Have ever thought strange someone get degree biology become biologist someone get degree computer science become senior software engineer
Before even really attempt define computer science understand bit hard define
Even social science formal science deal thing exist world without creating
But computer creation human
At least kind computer commonly recognize computer use field computer science
Everything within idea computer computation completely fluid lack perfect definition including idea computer
I spent several week researching computer I found commonly accepted definition computer
It even till around definition computer transferred term someone operating computing machine actual machine
No typo I rocker
It true statement
Consider whatever computer using read word actually running software directly hardware
Most likely sort operating system running hardware virtualizing actual physical hardware large degree
Most application written run operating system run actual hardware
This effect make operating system computer
We take one level say web browser using view post computer since browser programmed run application It equally difficult define data code
The two seem distinct separate many modern programming language allow u treat data code code data
Consider storing JavaScript database done JavaScript blog JavaScript data code
It depends look used
Even text content blog post people would say data actually code programming web crawler search engine like Google telling based actual content word
All lead realization everything computer world defined term abstraction always Other branch science like mathematics chemistry much le abstract based real concrete thing exist reality
Ok part probably expect I tell exactly computer science right
Wrong
Computer science nothing
It thing defined thing exists beyond imagination It false science
Everything might study computer science program actually belongs field science conveniently grouped computer science abstraction order catalogue important thing form basis build computer program
This say thing would learn computer science program value
It important know algorithm data structure computer architecture mathematics many thing based important realize study computer science different study field concept learn computer science program abstraction
They rule set stone like force nature form basis field study
We eventually hit point many existing abstraction computer put place built knowledge upon broken replaced new abstraction
John Sonmez founder Simple Programmer life coach software developer
He best selling author book First I would like point I really like blog often provide valuable question issue think
And I agree part post computer science
But mathematician I strongly disagree following Other branch science like mathematics much le abstract based real concrete thing exist It easy find definition mathematics broad field
But I assure mathematics without slightest prospect solving real world problem
Take example Fermat Last Theorem
To best knowledge far expert field
direct use real world except using proving theorem
But know maybe smart people find application Good point mathematics
I thought I enough background knowledge say sure
I casualty
I put way much trust curriculum online primarily education I received
Now appears I abstract degree computer science novice much expert little
Hiring manager care degree
It equitable work experience
They wanting train job
Hiring manager want see know work experience tangible proof
I really blame
The I blame
I sure people wish could life
In case I would take channel different way
At point seems I would much better
I think really need realize field computer science still early stage opposed area biological science studied thousand year
Science study natural also systematic knowledge physical material world gained observation experimentation defined obviously material key word implies also study synthetically generated area computer well simply surmise fundamental principle digital signal processed structured taken electricity binary hence computation also binary based
So I think computer science term hard understand yes I agree forever changing developing area science course valuable area study due vast involvement day day life also new exciting area human discovery
I pose question really synthetic natural phenomenon speak already That good point
I suppose look thing way everything natural

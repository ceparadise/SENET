Once idea game may start coming kind idea thing would like incorporate
In likely hood idea time ability implement
You need figure one essential game core mechanic Extra Credits guy call finding Once core gameplay fun add new feature
The temptation point add everything originally thought
Resist temptation
Instead add new feature playtest new feature work decided work need abandoned
Why add everything
Because every new thing add may problem
If add one new rule game start behaving oddly crash simply stop fun know problem changed one thing
If add ten new mechanic something break harder isolate thing combination rule caused problem

Next build minimum viable product MVP proof concept spending lot time arguing feature include exclude MVP
Finally MVP work well plan building full mature stable product
So wrong picture
Why go wrong many startup
The problem team understand point MVP
An MVP product half feature chopped way get product door little earlier
In fact MVP product
And something build consider job done
An MVP process repeat Identify riskiest assumption find smallest possible experiment test assumption use result experiment course correct
When build product make many assumption
You assume know user looking design work marketing strategy use architecture work efficiently monetization strategy make sustainable law regulation comply
No matter good assumption wrong
The problem know one
In startup CB Insights number one cause startup failure time market Nearly half startup spent month even year building product found wrong central assumption someone interested product first place
The way find way test put product front real user quickly possible
And often find go back drawing board
In fact go back drawing board
This unique product development
When writing book essay produce many draft spend lot time editing
And writing code frequently refactor even rewrite code
Every creative human endeavor requires enormous amount
In world one find error fastest win
Some people call philosophy fail At TripAdvisor called Eric Ries called
Kent Beck programmer called
Whatever call point find assumption wrong getting feedback product real user quickly possible
Whether building product writing code coming marketing plan always asking two question Let go example
You decide build product allows restaurant owner create mobile app restaurant click
It simple drag drop interface bunch template event calendar newsletter photo gallery chat integration review site social network Google Maps
And importantly offer way make reservation place order use coupon take small cut way monetize product
This going awesome
You find friend join typical startup team raise money lock room month try build feature
If slightly savvy cut feature essential first launch able launch MVP month instead
And case likely going fail
Why
Well consider many assumption making could turn disastrously wrong Waiting month discover critical flaw long
At best losing much time enormous waste worst put company business
In word Peter Drucker There surely nothing quite useless great efficiency done Let try approach see better
We build product incrementally stage asking At beginning riskiest assumption probably restaurant owner want create mobile apps
Therefore first MVP could mockup mobile app maybe even one back restaurant napkin fitting
Go around restaurant owner neighborhood ask problem technology
Do mobile app already
If
Do want one
How tech savvy
Do understand benefit
Show mockup
Find would good solution problem
You might find enough interest restaurant owner make viable business
That shame good news cost hour conversation instead month development
On hand might find restaurant owner interested mobile apps website
That progress
But done yet
Now must repeat process build next MVP
At point probably restaurant owner would actually willing pay website
What smallest experiment test assumption
One idea next MVP may create static website hand restaurant owner expressed interest see respond
Do like
Are impressed website already done
How much would pay site launched today
Perhaps faced immediate prospect spending money find restaurant owner actually interested
Well good thing learned day work instead wasting month development
Or perhaps find willing pay
So accept payment month service cash check waste lot time building billing system launch site ask email need update website info
Yes involves lot manual effort part
No scale number customer grows
But tiny startup afraid
Scaling good problem mean built something worth scaling
But meantime need repeat MVP process one time
At point might marketing strategy work
You go around every restaurant world
What smallest experiment test assumption
Your MVP could landing page describes product show restaurant website built hand earlier let visitor provide email address interested hearing launch
You buy hundred dollar ad Google Facebook Twitter LinkedIn drive traffic landing page see happens
If potential user even give email address probably going give money either
It much easier discover tweaking text image landing page rewriting thousand line code full product
The earlier find error le time wasted building wrong thing
This nutshell MVP process
Whether developing product design marketing plan writing code always ask A hat tip John Wanamaker father modern advertising said I know half advertising dollar wasted
I know In word Fred Brooks Plan throw one away Instead spending month building flexible system generate website could get first prototype done day using free static website filling manually based information learned restaurant owner launching free static
You could even use tool like show owner often people search restaurant cuisine general area
See way drive traffic landing page
You quickly make change messaging landing page ad use testing see find resonates audience

Comparison sorting algorithm fundamental requirement Ω log comparison input sequence require multiple log comparison algorithm based comparison better performance
Although many consider sorting solved optimal algorithm known since new algorithm still invented widely used dating first published
Sorting algorithm prevalent introductory class abundance algorithm problem provides gentle introduction variety core algorithm concept analysis
Sorting algorithm often classified Stable sort algorithm sort identical element order appear input
When sorting kind data part data examined determining sort order
For example card sorting example right card sorted rank suit ignored
This allows possibility multiple different correctly sorted version original list
Stable sorting algorithm choose one according following rule two item compare equal like two card relative order preserved one came input also come output
More formally data sorted represented record tuple value part data used sorting called
In card example card represented record rank suit key rank
A sorting algorithm stable whenever two record R S key R appears S original list R always appear S sorted list
When equal element indistinguishable integer generally data entire element key stability issue
Stability also issue key different
Unstable sorting algorithm specially implemented stable
One way artificially extend key comparison comparison two object otherwise equal key decided using order entry original input list
Remembering order however may require additional time space
One application stable sorting algorithm sorting list using primary secondary key
For example suppose wish sort hand card suit order club diamond heart spade within suit card sorted rank
This done first sorting card rank using sort stable sort suit Within suit stable sort preserve ordering rank already done
This idea extended number key leveraged
The effect achieved unstable sort using lexicographic key comparison compare first suit compare rank suit
In table number record sorted

The following table describes sorting algorithm impractical use traditional software context due extremely poor performance specialized hardware requirement
Theoretical computer scientist detailed sorting algorithm provide better O log time complexity assuming additional constraint including While large number sorting algorithm practical implementation algorithm predominate
Insertion sort widely used small data set large data set asymptotically efficient sort used primarily heap sort merge sort quicksort
Efficient implementation generally use combining asymptotically efficient algorithm overall sort insertion sort small list bottom recursion
Highly tuned implementation use sophisticated variant merge sort insertion sort additional logic used Android Java Python quicksort heap sort used variant form implementation
For restricted data number fixed interval counting sort radix sort widely used
Bubble sort variant rarely used practice commonly found teaching theoretical discussion
When physically sorting object alphabetizing paper test book people intuitively generally use insertion sort small set
For larger set people often first bucket initial letter multiple bucketing allows practical sorting large set
Often space relatively cheap spreading object floor large area operation expensive particularly moving object large distance locality reference important
Merge sort also practical physical object particularly two hand used one list merge algorithm heap sort quick sort poorly suited human use
Other algorithm variant insertion sort leaf space also practical physical use
Two simplest sort insertion sort selection sort efficient small data due low overhead efficient large data
Insertion sort generally faster selection sort practice due fewer comparison good performance data thus preferred practice selection sort us fewer writes thus used write performance limiting factor
simple sorting algorithm relatively efficient small list mostly sorted list often used part sophisticated algorithm
It work taking element list one one inserting correct position new sorted list
In array new list remaining element share array space insertion expensive requiring shifting following element one
see variant insertion sort efficient larger list

It complexity making inefficient large list generally performs worse similar
Selection sort noted simplicity also performance advantage complicated algorithm certain situation
The algorithm find minimum value swap value first position repeat step remainder list
It swap thus useful swapping expensive
Practical general sorting algorithm almost always based algorithm average time complexity generally complexity O log common heap sort merge sort quicksort
Each advantage drawback significant simple implementation merge sort us O additional space simple implementation quicksort O complexity
These problem solved ameliorated cost complex algorithm
While algorithm asymptotically efficient random data practical efficiency data various modification used
First overhead algorithm becomes significant smaller data often hybrid algorithm used commonly switching insertion sort data small enough
Second algorithm often perform poorly already sorted data almost sorted data common data sorted O time appropriate algorithm
Finally may also stability often desirable property sort
Thus sophisticated algorithm often employed based merge sort based quicksort falling back heap sort

It start comparing every two element swapping first come second
It merges resulting list two list four merges list four last two list merged final sorted list
Of algorithm described first scale well large list running time O log
It also easily applied list array requires sequential access random access
However additional O space complexity involves large number copy simple implementation
Merge sort seen relatively recent surge popularity practical implementation due use sophisticated algorithm used standard sort routine programming language
Merge sort standard routine among others used Java least since
much efficient version
It also work determining largest smallest element list placing end beginning list continuing rest list accomplishes task efficiently using data structure called special type
Once data list made heap root node guaranteed largest smallest element
When removed placed end list heap rearranged largest element remaining move root
Using heap finding next largest element take O log time instead O linear scan simple selection sort
This allows Heapsort run O log time also worst case complexity
relies operation partition array element called selected
All element smaller pivot moved greater element moved
This done efficiently linear time
The lesser greater sublists recursively sorted
This yield average time complexity O log low overhead thus popular algorithm
Efficient implementation quicksort partitioning typically unstable sort somewhat complex among fastest sorting algorithm practice
Together modest O log space usage quicksort one popular sorting algorithm available many standard programming library
The important caveat quicksort performance O rare naive implementation choosing first last element pivot occurs sorted data common case
The complex issue quicksort thus choosing good pivot element consistently poor choice pivot result drastically slower O performance good choice pivot yield O log performance asymptotically optimal
For example step chosen pivot algorithm work O log
Finding median however O operation unsorted list therefore exacts significant overhead sorting
In practice choosing random pivot almost certainly yield O log performance
Bubble sort variant simple highly inefficient sort
They thus frequently seen introductory text theoretical interest due ease analysis rarely used practice primarily recreational interest
Some variant Shell sort open question behavior
simple sorting algorithm

It compare first two element first greater second swap
It continues pair adjacent element end data set
It start first two element repeating swap occurred last pas
This algorithm average time performance O rarely used sort large unordered data set
Bubble sort used sort small number item asymptotic inefficiency high penalty
Bubble sort also used efficiently list length nearly sorted element significantly place
For example number element place one position

invented
It improves upon bubble sort insertion sort moving order element one position time
The concept behind Shellsort algorithm perform O k time k greatest distance two element
This mean generally perform O data mostly sorted element place perform faster
So first sorting element far away progressively shrinking gap element sort final sort computes much faster
One implementation described arranging data sequence array sorting column array using insertion sort
The time complexity Shell sort largely depends gap sequence used range O O log
Also unlike efficient sorting algorithm Shellsort require use making useful memory premium
relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed Wlodzimierz Dobosiewicz
It later rediscovered popularized Stephen Lacey Richard Box article published April
Comb sort improves
The basic idea eliminate small value near end list since bubble sort slow sorting tremendously
large value around beginning list pose problem bubble sort refers sorting algorithm data distributed input multiple intermediate structure gathered placed output
For example distribution based sorting algorithm
Distribution sorting algorithm used single processor individual subset separately sorted different processor combined
This allows data large fit single computer memory
Counting sort applicable input known belong particular set possibility
The algorithm run O time O memory length input
It work creating integer array size using th bin count occurrence th member input
Each input counted incrementing value corresponding bin
Afterward counting array looped arrange input order
This sorting algorithm often used need reasonably small algorithm efficient extremely fast demonstrates great asymptotic behavior increase
It also modified provide stable behavior
Bucket sort sorting algorithm generalizes partitioning array finite number bucket
Each bucket sorted individually either using different sorting algorithm recursively applying bucket sorting algorithm
A bucket sort work best element data set evenly distributed across bucket
algorithm sort number processing individual digit
number consisting digit sorted O time
Radix sort process digit number either starting LSD starting MSD
The LSD algorithm first sort list least significant digit preserving relative order using stable sort
Then sort next digit least significant significant ending sorted list
While LSD radix sort requires use stable sort MSD radix sort algorithm unless stable sorting desired
MSD radix sort stable
It common algorithm used internally radix sort
A sorting approach using small bin improves performance radix sort significantly
When size array sorted approach exceeds available primary memory much slower disk swap space must employed memory usage pattern sorting algorithm becomes important algorithm might fairly efficient array fit easily RAM may become impractical
In scenario total number comparison becomes relatively le important number time section memory must copied swapped disk dominate performance characteristic algorithm
Thus number pass localization comparison important raw number comparison since comparison nearby element one another happen speed caching even speed compared disk speed virtually instantaneous
For example popular recursive algorithm provides quite reasonable performance adequate RAM due recursive way copy portion array becomes much le practical array fit RAM may cause number slow copy move operation disk
In scenario another algorithm may preferable even requires total comparison
One way work around problem work well complex record sorted relatively small key field create index array sort index rather entire array
A sorted version entire array produced one pas reading index often even unnecessary sorted index adequate
Because index much smaller entire array may fit easily memory entire array would effectively eliminating problem
This procedure sometimes called tag sort
Another technique overcoming problem using example one way combine two algorithm way take advantage strength improve overall performance
For instance array might subdivided chunk size fit RAM content chunk sorted using efficient algorithm result merged using merge similar used
This faster performing either mergesort quicksort entire list
Techniques also combined
For sorting large set data vastly exceed system memory even index may need sorted using algorithm combination algorithm designed perform reasonably reduce amount swapping required
Related problem include sorting smallest element list alternatively computing smallest element unordered computing th smallest element
These solved inefficiently total sort efficient algorithm exist often derived generalizing sorting algorithm
The notable example related
Conversely sorting algorithm derived repeated application selection algorithm quicksort quickselect seen pivoting move differing whether one recurses side quicksort one side quickselect
A kind opposite sorting algorithm
These fundamentally different require source random number
Interestingly shuffling also implemented sorting algorithm namely random sort assigning random number element list sorting based random number
This generally done practice however simple efficient algorithm shuffling

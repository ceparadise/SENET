Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
The company I work conduct quarterly performance review
As member small QA team I ask help define process
A lot I identifying issue collaborating devs reach solution
What deliverable QA department
Would hard metric useful
I fear metric issue example might lead focus creating large number issue little value
Any suggestion would appreciated
The deliverable information system
The purpose help people make better decision based information system
The problem form hard metric field like software QA use answer I give often depends
Each hard data point really helpful context development project link even variation
I suggest take look answer question suggested possible duplicate including
Deliverables view consist information system Dale Emery said
If use case user story thing would consider Where use story far ideal certainly happens want look item If issue tracking database area consider Some thing consider nature information tester generate routinely provide information complex configuration later becomes core documentation team work
Do provide list gotchas caveat software whether particular feature used conjunction feature required setting
Do warn fragile software work everything exactly right
Do try ensure software guide user action
It worth remembering software development odd mix science art testing possibly even
The science part quantified art aspect ca like art every software development project different
experience deliverable vary one project another
For instance I involved new feature ship within couple month
Due time pressure I wrote deployment guide document sale engineer know deploy customer environment without banging head wall
That become key deliverable project QA
In short apart usual tester routine like raising quality bug report rejection rate low look QA department bridge clarity product requirement documentation etc
I think number possible deliverable
Pick team stakeholder need
I would say QA deparments provides Deliverables dependent project customer product agreed prior test preparation phase
At basic level QA dept might product single saying Product passed failed
On top customer internal management might require level detail including test script
Strong project obviously require greater detail coverage documentation although even agile project provide
When I defining test deliverable I aim provide bare minimum time spent providing documentation time spent testing
However two overriding concern omitted deliverable As test execution something provided
I know might balk use word bare minimum I worked company lot documentation provided never looked even referred
Product quality suffered consequence cardinal sin test department
I would also suggest looking thing like Return Investment automation Automation coverage code coverage test automated Think bigger make QA team look team produce metric
The deliverable QA would There lot answer question find good answer
This topic easy stuff
The QA team delivers trust product feeling safety work work properly
On hand QA team provides information defect product organization able provide information customer service possible defect workarounds
By posting answer agree

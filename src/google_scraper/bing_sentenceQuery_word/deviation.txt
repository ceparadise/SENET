On drive school one day decide start timing long take
You measure time every day week find drive took minute
Thus average time spent driving school minute
The next week repeat process find time minute
The average time turn minute first week
However probably noticed second week likelihood arriving extremely early late much greater even though average time
During first week time within small range two minute average whereas time second week much
This essentially concept tell u much individual value data set spread average mean set
The standard deviation additional value used describe data set
The standard deviation data set calculated number tell close far value data set relation mean
It important tell u information data set mean provide
To calculate standard deviation must first find data set
The variance defined average sum squared difference value set
In word find difference point mean data set square difference
You every number data set add squared value together
Finally divide variance either number item data set usually referred one le number item set written
What divide depends whether calculating variance whole population sample

It important note standard deviation population standard error statistic derived population mean quite different related related inverse square root number observation
The reported margin error poll computed standard error mean alternatively product standard deviation population inverse square root sample size thing typically twice standard percent
In science many researcher report standard deviation experimental data effect fall much farther two standard deviation away would expected considered random error variation measurement way distinguished likely genuine effect association

Logan give following example
Furness Bryant measured resting male female breeding
The table show Furness data set
The graph show metabolic rate male female
By visual inspection appears variability metabolic rate greater male female
The sample standard deviation metabolic rate female fulmar calculated follows
The formula sample standard deviation observed value sample item mean value observation number observation sample
In sample standard deviation formula example numerator sum squared deviation individual animal metabolic rate mean metabolic rate
The table show calculation sum squared deviation female fulmar
For female sum squared deviation shown table
The denominator sample standard deviation formula N N number animal
In example N female denominator
The sample standard deviation female fulmar therefore For male fulmar similar calculation give sample standard deviation approximately twice large standard deviation female
The graph show metabolic rate data mean red dot standard deviation red line female male
Use sample standard deviation implies fulmar sample larger population fulmar
If fulmar comprised entire population perhaps last surviving fulmar instead sample standard deviation calculation would use population standard deviation
In population standard deviation formula denominator N instead
It rare measurement taken entire population default statistical software package calculate sample standard deviation
Similarly journal article report sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified

One find standard deviation entire population case every member population sampled
In case done standard deviation estimated examining random sample taken population computing sample used estimate population standard deviation
Such statistic called estimator value estimator namely estimate called denoted possibly modifier
However unlike case estimating population mean simple estimator many desirable property maximum likelihood single estimator standard deviation property technically involved problem
Most often standard deviation estimated using using defined often referred sample standard deviation without qualifier
However estimator better respect uncorrected estimator using yield lower mean squared error using normal distribution almost completely eliminates bias
The formula standard deviation finite population applied sample using size sample size population though actual population size sample drawn may much larger
This estimator denoted known sometimes considered entire population defined follows observed value sample item mean value observation denominator stand size sample square root sample variance average sample mean
This converges probability population value number sample go infinity population normally distributed
However estimate generally low
The bias decrease sample size grows dropping thus significant small moderate sample size bias
Thus large sample size uncorrected sample standard deviation generally acceptable
This estimator also uniformly smaller corrected sample standard deviation
If second sample estimate population variance used compute estimate population standard deviation result Here taking square root introduces downward bias due square root
The bias variance easily corrected bias square root difficult correct depends distribution question

This estimator commonly used generally known simply sample standard deviation
The bias may still large small sample le
As sample size increase amount bias decrease
We obtain information difference becomes smaller
For formula work across distribution unlike mean variance
Instead used basis scaled correction factor produce unbiased estimate
For normal distribution unbiased estimator given correction factor depends given term equal This arises sampling distribution sample standard deviation follows scaled correction factor mean chi distribution
An approximation given replacing yielding The error approximation decay quadratically suited smallest sample highest precision n bias equal n bias already le
For distribution correct formula depends distribution rule thumb use refinement approximation denotes population
The excess kurtosis may either known beforehand certain distribution estimated data
The standard deviation obtain sampling distribution absolutely accurate mathematical reason explained confidence interval practical reason measurement measurement error
The mathematical effect described CI
To show larger sample make confidence interval narrower consider following example A small population degree freedom estimating standard deviation
The result CI SD run SD SD quantile distribution degree freedom confidence level
This equivalent following With
The reciprocal square root two number give u factor given
A larger population degree freedom estimating standard deviation
The computation give u case CI running
So even sample population actual SD still almost factor higher sampled SD
For sample population
To certain sampled SD close actual SD need sample large number point
These formula used obtain confidence interval variance residual fit standard normal theory number error
The standard deviation invariant change scale directly random variable
Thus constant random variable The standard deviation sum two random variable related individual standard deviation stand variance respectively

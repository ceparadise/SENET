In property instituted purpose preventing requirement one never enter time another thread execution enters critical section
The requirement mutual exclusion first identified solved seminal paper titled credited first topic study
A simple example mutual exclusion important practice visualized using four item second third removed
The removal node sits node performed changing pointer previous node point next node word node removed pointer node changed point node thereby removing linked list reference node
When linked list shared multiple thread execution two thread execution may attempt remove two different node simultaneously one thread execution changing pointer node point node another thread execution change pointer node point node
Although removal operation complete successfully desired state linked list achieved node remains list pointer node point node
This problem called avoided using requirement mutual exclusion ensure simultaneous update part list occur
The problem mutual exclusion address problem resource sharing software system control multiple process access shared resource process need exclusive control resource work
The solution make shared resource available process specific code segment called
It control access shared resource controlling mutual execution part program resource would used
A successful solution problem must least two property Deadlock freedom expanded implement one property Every process program partitioned four section resulting four state
Program execution cycle four state order If process wish enter critical section must first execute trying section wait acquires access critical section
After process executed critical section finished shared resource need execute exit section release process use
The process return section
There software hardware solution enforcing mutual exclusion
Some different solution discussed
On system simplest solution achieve mutual exclusion disable process critical section
This prevent running effectively preventing process
Although solution effective lead many problem
If critical section long drift every time critical section executed timer interrupt longer serviced tracking time impossible critical section
Also process halt critical section control never returned another process effectively halting entire system
A elegant method achieving mutual exclusion
effective uniprocessor system
The use shared memory instruction provide mutual exclusion
A process location shared memory since operation atomic one process set flag time
Any process unsuccessful setting flag either go task try later release processor another process try later continue loop checking flag successful acquiring
still possible method allows system continue process halt holding lock
Several atomic operation used provide mutual exclusion data structure notable CAS
CAS used achieve mutual exclusion shared data structure creating linked list node represents desired operation performed
CAS used change pointer linked list insertion new node
Only one process successful CAS process attempting add node time try
Each process keep local copy data structure upon traversing linked list perform operation list local copy
Beside solution software solution exist use achieve mutual exclusion
Examples include following These algorithm work used platform executes
Programmers specify strict ordering memory operation within thread
It often preferable use synchronization facility provided operating system multithreading library take advantage hardware solution possible use software solution hardware solution exist
For example operating system library used thread try acquire already acquired lock operating system could suspend thread using swap another thread ready run could put processor low power state thread run
Therefore modern mutual exclusion method attempt reduce using queuing context switch
However time spent suspending thread restoring proven always time must waited thread become ready run blocked particular situation acceptable solution situation
One binary test set register sufficient provide solution mutual exclusion problem
But solution built test set register possibly lead starvation process become caught trying section
In fact distinct memory state required avoid lockout
To avoid unbounded waiting distinct memory state required
Most algorithm mutual exclusion designed assumption failure occurs process running inside critical section
However reality failure may commonplace
For example sudden loss power faulty interconnect might cause process critical section experience unrecoverable error otherwise unable continue
If failure occurs conventional mutual exclusion algorithm may deadlock otherwise fail key liveness property
To deal problem several solution using mechanism proposed
The solution explained used build synchronization primitive Many form mutual exclusion
For example classic permit one process get semaphore another process get second semaphore wait till semaphore released
Other common include process never get sufficient resource run completion higher priority thread wait thread high latency response interrupt prompt
Much research aimed eliminating effect often goal guaranteeing
No perfect scheme known
Blocking system call used sleep entire process
Until call became proper mechanism sleeping single thread within process see

Sign Profile find Reading Lists Saved Searches Response option survey question one response option true single respondent
Consider survey question asks respondent A respondent commute minute day could choose either second third response option option mutually exclusive
Because response option overlap researcher examining response question differentiate respondent adjacent category
Not providing mutually exclusive response option common mistake made writing survey question
One could rewrite survey question mutually exclusive

Cluster analysis statistical technique used identify various unit like people group society grouped together characteristic common
Also known clustering exploratory data analysis tool aim sort different object group way belong group maximal degree association belong group degree association minimal
Unlike structure uncovered cluster analysis need explanation interpretation discovers structure data without explaining exist
Clustering exists almost every aspect daily life
Take example item grocery store
Different type item always displayed nearby location meat vegetable soda cereal paper product etc
Researchers often want data group object subject cluster make sense
To take example social science let say looking country want group cluster based characteristic military technology educated population
We would find Britain Japan France Germany United States similar characteristic would clustered together
Uganda Nicaragua Pakistan would also grouped together different cluster share different set characteristic including low level wealth simpler division labor relatively unstable undemocratic political institution low technological development
Cluster analysis typically used exploratory phase research researcher
It commonly statistical method used rather done early stage project help guide rest analysis
For reason significance testing usually neither relevant appropriate
There several different type cluster analysis
The two commonly used clustering hierarchical clustering
clustering treat observation data object location distance note distance used clustering often represent spatial distance
It partition object K mutually exclusive cluster object within cluster close possible time far object cluster possible
Each cluster characterized
Hierarchical clustering way investigate grouping data simultaneously variety scale distance
It creating cluster tree various level
Unlike clustering tree single set cluster
Rather tree hierarchy cluster one level joined cluster next higher level
The algorithm used start case variable separate cluster combine cluster one left
This allows researcher decide level clustering appropriate research
Most perform cluster analysis

I know difference clustering classification machine learning I understand difference text classification topic modeling document
Can I use topic modeling document identify topic
Can I use classification method classify text inside document
I give bunch document label attached
I ask learn think content document given label based word
Then I give new document ask think label one
The label meaning necessarily
I give bunch document without label
I ask explain document word identifying topic
You tell topic telling much document I decide topic mean anything
You clarify identify one topic classify text
But I know difference text classification topic model document Text classification form supervised learning set possible class advance change
Topic modeling form unsupervised learning akin clustering set possible topic unknown apriori
They defined part generating topic model
With algorithm like LDA get different topic time run algorithm
Text classification often involves class think bucket
But given right kind labeled input data set series binary classifier
Topic modeling generally document probability distribution spread across many topic
In addition also hierarchical topic modeling method etc
Also I use topic model document identify one topic later I use classification classify text inside document
If asking whether take document assigned one topic topic modeling algorithm apply classifier collection yes certainly
I sure make much sense though minimum need pick threshold topic probability distribution include document collection typically
Can elaborate use case
By way great tutorial topic modeling using MALLET library Java available Topic model usually
There supervised topic model even try model

may class football may topic inside class relate particular match team
The challenge topic change time consider match example
Such topic may emerge disappear

Abstract Clustering involves placing entity mutually exclusive category
We wish relax requirement mutual exclusivity allowing object belong simultaneously multiple class formulation refer feature allocation
The first step theoretical one
In case clustering class probability distribution exchangeable partition dataset characterized via exchangeable partition probability function Kingman paintbox
These characterization support elegant nonparametric Bayesian framework clustering number cluster assumed known priori
We establish analogous characterization feature allocation define notion exchangeable feature probability function feature paintbox lead Bayesian framework require number feature fixed priori
The second step computational one
Rather appealing Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian inference develop method transform Bayesian method feature allocation latent structure problem optimization problem objective function analogous clustering setting
These yield approximation Bayesian inference scalable large inference problem

Rapidly reduce uncertainty assumption required true extrapolation zero angle
Best highest ratio light scattering detector used molecular weight determination
The Molecular Weight Analyzer simple use incorporates sophisticated feature
Inject sample flow cell
The sample illuminated temperature stabilized precision diode laser
The CCD detector automatically collect scattered light
Then software extrapolates data zero angle absolute molecular weight determination
There two way use Determine molecular weight distribution flow mode determine average molecular weight
Macromolecular sample often range molecular weight
In case distribution quite narrow case broad multimodal
Variations distribution indicate presence impurity aggregation
However application average molecular weight sufficient characterize sample
Sometimes distribution interest sometimes overall average sufficient
Either way right tool job
When distribution molecular weight sample important consider chromatography detector system
In way readily determine true molecular weight distribution
Many average value unavailable batch mode measurement calculated distribution
Better yet molecular weight distribution determined problem column calibration avoided
Size exclusion chromatography SEC also known gel permeation chromatography GPC us column separate polymer sample
In standard method column calibrated obtain relationship molecular weight elution volume
However interaction depends size molecular weight also chemistry sample
Therefore accurate column calibration requires standard range molecular weight exactly chemistry structure branching sample
With exception standard difficult impossible obtain especially new unique material
The provides method determining absolute molecular weight without resorting assumption sample column calibration
Simply attach appropriate concentration detector GPC software end SEC column
The column used separate specie interest give full information molecular weight fraction

All fitting coupled sophisticated statistical analysis
Finally software incorporates algorithm taking advantage flow system remove artifact due contaminant dust
Thus good information recovered even imperfect sample
Absolute molecular weight determined scattered intensity zero angle
Unfortunately impossible measure scattered light zero angle since transmitted light also measured
Measurement one nonzero angle extrapolation zero angle necessary molecular weight determination
A light scattering instrument relies extrapolation based one data point occasionally work
In addition measurement change scattering angle necessary determine radius gyration
Therefore instrument far better instrument
When comparing instrument keep mind precision light scattering result approximately proportional square root number angle
Thus result instrument significantly precise result instrument

In measure used describe degree executed particular run
A program high test coverage measured percentage source code executed testing suggests lower chance containing undetected compared program low test coverage
Many different metric used calculate test coverage basic percentage program percentage program called execution test suite
Test coverage among first method invented systematic
The first published reference Miller Maloney
To measure percentage code exercised one used
Coverage criterion usually defined rule requirement test suite need satisfy
There number coverage criterion main one For example consider following C function Assume function part bigger program program run test suite
Condition coverage necessarily imply branch coverage
For example consider following fragment code Condition coverage satisfied two test However set test satisfy branch coverage since neither case meet condition
may necessary ensure condition branch code adequate coverage testing
A combination function coverage branch coverage sometimes also called
This criterion requires every point entry exit program invoked least every decision program taken possible outcome least
In context decision boolean expression composed condition zero boolean operator
This definition branch coverage however use term synonym
requires decision condition coverage satisfied
However application avionics software often required satisfied
This criterion extends criterion requirement condition affect decision outcome independently
For example consider following code The criterion satisfied following set test However test set satisfy modified coverage since first test value second test value would influence output
So following test set needed satisfy This criterion requires combination condition inside decision tested
For example code fragment previous section require eight test PVC requires method taking parameter common value parameter considered
The idea common possible value parameter tested
For example common value string null empty whitespace space tab newline valid string invalid string string string
It may also appropriate use long string
Failure test possible parameter value may leave bug
Testing one could result code coverage line covered one seven option tested PVC
There coverage criterion used le often application often required demonstrate form test coverage
For example standard demand statement decision coverage two four different criticality level one target coverage value negotiation supplier customer
However setting specific target value particular criticized practitioner various reason cf
Martin Fowler writes I would suspicious anything like would smell someone writing test make coverage number happy thinking
Some coverage criterion connected
For instance path coverage implies decision statement coverage
Decision coverage implies statement coverage every statement part branch
Full path coverage type described usually impractical impossible
Any module succession decision path within loop construct result infinite number path
Many path may also infeasible input program test cause particular path executed
However algorithm identifying infeasible path proven impossible algorithm could used solve
instance method achieving complete branch coverage without achieving complete path coverage
Methods practical path coverage testing instead attempt identify class code path differ number loop execution achieve basis path coverage tester must cover path class
The target software built special option library run controlled environment map every executed fuction function point source code
This allows testing part target software rarely never accessed normal condition help reassure important condition function point tested
The resulting output analyzed see area code exercised test updated include area necessary
Combined test coverage method aim develop rigorous yet manageable set regression test
In implementing test coverage policy within software development environment one must consider following Software author look test coverage result devise additional test input configuration set increase coverage vital function
Two common form test coverage statement line coverage branch edge coverage
Line coverage report execution footprint testing term line code executed complete test
Edge coverage report branch code decision point executed complete test
They report coverage metric measured percentage
The meaning depends form coverage used branch coverage comprehensive statement coverage
Generally test coverage tool incur computation logging addition actual program thereby slowing application typically analysis done production
As one might expect class software feasibly subjected coverage test though degree coverage mapping approximated analysis rather direct testing
There also sort defect affected tool
In particular similar sensitive operation masked run test environment conversely reliably defect may become easier find result additional overhead testing code
Test coverage one consideration safety certification avionics equipment
The guideline avionics gear certified FAA documented recently released
Test coverage also requirement part automotive safety standard

What Code Coverage YOU measure
I asked question regarding automating testing code coverage
It seems outside automated tool art science
Anyone real world example use code coverage
Code Coverage measurement many code executed automated test running
Code coverage collected using specialized tool instrument binary add tracing call run full set automated test instrumented product
A good tool give percentage code executed also allow drill data see exactly line code executed particular test
Our team us set code coverage tool
If shop VS integrated tool collect code coverage
You also roll custom tool like describes
If shop Intel run Windows Linux though I used
I also heard gcov tool gcc I know anything ca give link
As use code coverage one exit criterion milestone
We actually three code coverage metric coverage unit test dev team scenario test test team combined coverage
Btw code coverage good metric much testing necessarily good metric well testing product
There metric use along code coverage ensure quality
Code coverage basically test much code covered test
So code coverage mean code covered test
I know might thinking code covered look different angle
What stopping get code coverage
A good example Now code two
If always hitting YES branch covering else part shown Code Coverage result
This good know covered write test cover else part
If code coverage sitting time bomb explode
good tool measure code coverage
Just remember mean everything tested completely mean every line code tested mean tested every common
I would use highlight bit code I probably write test
For example whatever tool show myImportantFunction executed running current probably improved
Basically mean code perfect
Use guide write comprehensive test
Complimenting point many answer
Code coverage mean well test set covering source code

extent source code covered set Test case
As mentioned answer various coverage criterion like path condition function statement etc
But additional criterion covered Note Static code analysis find unreachable code hanging code
code covered function call
And also static coverage
Even static code analysis report code covered give report testing set possible code coverage tested
Code coverage explained well answer
So answer second part question
We used tool determine
another one used slightly different purpose unit testing
It used generate coverage report accessed
This coupled tool ex Canoo give useful coverage report tell much code covered typical end user usage
We use tool Code Coverage simply measure code tested
There variety coverage criterion measured typically various path condition function statement within program makeup total coverage
The code coverage metric percentage test execute coverage criterion
As far I go tracking unit test coverage project I use static code analysis tool keep track
For Perl excellent module I regularly use module
If build installation managed Module simply run get nice HTML site tell coverage per sub line condition nice color making easy see code path covered
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

The Graduate Field Computer Science seek produce researcher demonstrated breadth computer science depth specific area concentration
Although program designed flexible student CS program must complete several requirement imposed Field Cornell Graduate School Each requirement described detail followed answer common student question
Because document hope cover nuance student question concern consult advisor Director Graduate Studies DGS
The Field requirement recently updated Fall
Students matriculating Spring later must fulfill new requirement
Students matriculated program earlier may choose fulfill either new requirement
The Field belief certain area fundamental Computer Science student competent
candidate expected demonstrate competency high undergraduate level four computer science Artificial Intelligence Programming Languages Systems Theory
This requirement discharged either two way Each area required offer student least one option
Whichever method chosen requirement must fulfilled acceptable performance judged Field
For option generally mean grade higher graduate course higher undergraduate course
The acceptable course This requirement must fulfilled time A exam
student must take least five course grade credit
Note certain level course count
These course must cover least four different CS three CS
The requirement intended expose student research problem technique associated different research area also different value system various computer science research style differ evaluate validate research result
Courses taken satisfy competency requirement used count towards breadth requirement
Courses level count course field however see
The relevant course follows The relevant course following The following table summarizing breadth requirement may helpful though list definitive
Students must take five course covering four row table three column
As competency requirement breadth requirement must fulfilled acceptable performance judged Field
A grade B better generally acceptable
Students must take least two course semester first year two Cornell level making breadth requirement easy fulfill
Exceptions made upon request research advisor approval DGS first week class
The list course satisfy area research style requirement breadth requirement subject change faculty develops new course
student required satisfy project requirement writing significant piece software
One way satisfy project requirement taking course significant coding component instructor course certify project satisfied project requirement
The student typically expected get grade better course
The project requirement also satisfied project outside class example part independent research thesis research part summer job
In case chair special committee need certify satisfied project requirement
student must serve teaching assistant least two semester teach course least one semester
Contact student valuable preparation possible academic career experience communicating idea group important setting academic otherwise
We recognize Field requirement stated may universally appropriate especially nontraditional area computational biology may require significant coursework outside computer science
In exceptional case student encouraged formulate alternative course study consultation special committee present proposal Field approval
As student must residence least six semester four already hold Master degree time enrollment
The advisor DGS award one satisfactory completion semester study
Fractional unit may awarded unsatisfactory progress
Before start fourth semester must form
The special committee consists two
When specify member committee must specify area concentration represent
These must area officially recognized Graduate School associated committee member field
The Field Computer Science six official area concentration listed along associated subareas The chair special committee represents major area concentration normally thesis advisor
The chair member Field Computer Science
The area graduate student field wish minor Computer Science
It may specified either major minor area concentration student CS
The two minor member special committee represent minor subject see
While suffices three people special committee many advantage
Your committee member often provide useful advice
Being committee also mean likely know work better help want write letter reference
Note three special committee member need Cornell
The rest institution industry
The minor requirement Graduate School requirement CS Field requirement
All student Cornell must two minor
For student Computer Science Field requires one external Computer Science one internal
The external minor must field CS
The minor requirement minor field
Related field Operations Research Mathematics Cognitive Studies Electrical Computer Engineering common choice
However minor field acceptable
When choose minor field must also choose area concentration field minor advisor member field
The minor advisor serf special committee work setting minor requirement
Typically involves knowledge graduate course field expectation vary depending upon field
Before settling minor field student find field requirement
There additional requirement internal minor except minor area concentration must different major area concentration
The A exam oral exam
It final test preparedness undertaking thesis research
The content coverage A exam determined special committee discussed student beforehand
Often student describe problem attacked thesis give preliminary research result
But might instead student present survey research area
Occasionally serf opportunity present completed research unrelated thesis topic
Some committee expect student prepare written document prior exam might cover content discussed exam complement content
Students normally aim take A exam third year graduate study
Students required completed competency requirement least two unit residency prior A exam
In addition student must attempt A exam seventh semester study
More detail university requirement found
Although student normally made substantial progress towards completing breadth requirement taking A exam necessary completed requirement A exam
Note minor advisor may require taken course minor A exam check
The B exam thesis defense
It strongly recommended draft thesis provided committee three four week prior B exam
In case require minor editing exam
However B exam committee may ask revision case possible student pas B exam yet full approval thesis
The degree awarded passed B exam filed approved dissertation University completed requirement
The University requires minimum two unit residency A exam B exam
Most student complete B exam within four six year arrival Cornell
Here answer common question concern student
Again encouraged consult advisor Director Graduate Studies concern covered
There lot opportunity
Some popular option include research faculty member often advisor potential advisor particularly appropriate get along program teaching course summer internship
We believe interest spend one summer intern industry research lab University
Doing expose perspective field priority driving industry really help later enter job market
We suggest many option help find good match interest
Your advisor may also contact would lead interesting internship opportunity
For foreign student internship satisfy requirement practical training student visa hence special visa approval required
Most student spend least one two summer intern usually first three year Cornell
The Field Computer Science meet annually January
At meeting progress student examined
The DGS summarizes progress towards requirement present summary course taken grade received indicates whether student taken scheduled take A exam
For student Cornell semester emphasis discussion progress toward identifying research topic forming special committee launching research program lead dissertation
Normally student current advisor briefly describe student recent progress
The goal meeting understand best help student establish researcher publish work graduate within normal time period
If consensus emerges particular student may heading toward successful completion degree program field discus appropriate action always depends specific situation
While student occasionally asked leave program happens rarely
In case student ever asked leave program without first given warning time correct situation except case serious violation University code conduct
No
Most student extensive coursework computer science prior arrival Cornell hence situation norm exception
The field established requirement way certifying despite varied emphasis coverage undergraduate program student come graduate broadly educated
Besides need retake course need take exam
Maybe familiar enough institution transferring calibrate quality program
You negotiate transfer credit DGS advisor
No course used listed explicitly
To understand allowed general consider CS old graduate course correspond CS old CS old
CS old undergraduate operating system course spends lot time concurrency technique protecting concurrent program bug caused race condition unprotected shared variable reentrancy
It delf deeply memory management virtual memory mechanism look question protection performance general structure functionality
Although CS old CS old also system course tend specialize topic fact reason CS old system area requirement precisely course like CS old assume student broad grounding
One could earn high grade CS old without ever needing demonstrate good understanding concurrency despite fact weakness one background would real problem exploiting modern computing platform
For reason system area consider CS old acceptable substitute CS old demonstrating area proficiency
Most student enter Cornell good idea area want specialize
Those still strong area interest
By reading recent research paper annual report course description pick course taught faculty member might enjoy working
Focus area believe talent good idea interest
Being TA faculty member may want work often good idea especially course general area interest talent
Faculty member always available talk graduate student potential research topic area student talk joining research group
It common faculty member suggest working student period time perhaps semester considering relationship official
Some student approach potential advisor soon arriving campus others may take time shop around
All student try identify advisor end first year Cornell
If interest change time thing working committee chair advisor may decide reconstitute committee
This considered bad thing leave blot record
All field member interest seeing student best innovative work capable mean changing advisor topic
Most student take A exam satisfied majority field requirement many completed minor minor field requirement read rule published minor field select
The special committee typically let schedule A exam prior completion coursework although expected student finished coursework requirement three year Cornell
The competency breadth requirement relate CS field want student scholar familiar world beyond area CS
The minor requirement reflects philosophy
Note CS Field accepts proposed minor even one completely unrelated student program study
This problem
The graduate office maintains file student includes checklist various requirement
Each year prior annual review student progress occurs January graduate office update checklist
Of course think record missing pertinent information told need take course already taken let u know
I primarily interested disappointed see competency requirement emphasizes area
Why I penalized sense theory system language student would fewer requirement I
The competency requirement reflect field consensus corresponding course cover core set concept material computer scientist need familiar comfortable simply able participate normal dialogue computer scientist
We view penalty people work outside core area rather type common background provides context interacting colleague
The requirement designed flexible
Our course requirement work fewer one per semester average student
Obviously course prove interesting directly relevant others hope many student discover new area interest taking course outside narrow research focus
In case Exceptions clause make strong case requirement stated inhibit progress research chosen area study able formulate alternative program consultation advisor Field happy entertain proposal
We recognize computer science evolving rapidly
Areas considered central ten year ago may peripheral
While area competency requirement represent faculty consensus material every computer scientist know topic frequently revisit

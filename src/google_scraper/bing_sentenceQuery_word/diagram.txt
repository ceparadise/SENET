A symbolic according technique
Diagrams used since ancient time became prevalent
Sometimes technique us visualization onto surface
The word sometimes used diagram
The term diagram commonly used sense general specific meaning In science term used way
For example Anderson stated generally diagram pictorial yet abstract representation information example diagram whereas photograph video
On hand Lowe defined diagram specifically abstract graphic portrayal subject matter represent
In specific sense diagram chart contrast technical illustration map showing abstract rather representation information
The essence diagram seen Or Hall word diagram simplified figure caricature way intended convey essential meaning
These simplified figure often based set rule
The basic shape according White characterized term elegance clarity ease pattern simplicity validity
Elegance basically determined whether diagram simplest fitting solution problem
There least following type diagram type diagram Many type diagram commonly generated using diagramming software
Thousands diagram technique exist

Venn diagram going nickname primary diagram set diagram logic diagram widely known
This kind diagram show possible logical relation finite collection different set
These diagram depict element point plane well set region inside closed curve
A Venn diagram consists multiple overlapping closed curve usually represented circle represents set
The point inside curve labeled S represent element set S point outside boundary represent element set S
In Venn diagram curve overlapped different way showing possible relation existing set
This kind diagram invented year paper work named On Diagrammatic Mechanical Representation Propositions Reasonings John Venn Philosophical Magazine Journal Science used teach elementary set theory well illustrate simple set relationship logic linguistics probability computer science
Venn never used term Venn diagram referred invention Eulerian Circles
An scaled Venn diagram Venn diagram area shape proportional number element contains
Venn diagram general similar Euler diagram invented Leonhard Euler century
Baron noted Leibniz century produced similar diagram Euler unpublished
In century Venn diagram better developed Henderson showed existence diagram rotational symmetry implied n prime number mean natural number greater positive divisor
Henderson also showed symmetric Venn diagram exist n
In year Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagram n Griggs Killian Savage showed symmetric Venn diagram exist prime
Thus rotationally symmetric Venn diagram exist n prime number
Venn diagram Euler diagram incorporated part instruction set theory part new math movement
Since also adopted curriculum field
A Venn diagram built using collection simple closed curve plane
The principle diagram class also known set represented region relation one another possible logical relation class set indicated diagram
That diagram initially leaf room possible relation class
The actual given relation within diagram specified indicating particular region null
Venn diagram normally comprise overlapping circle
The inner part circle aid symbol represents element set
The exterior though implies element included set
For example Venn diagram one circle may represent group object made wood another circle may represent set table
The overlapping region would represent set wooden table
Any shape circle employed shown Venn higher set diagram
Venn diagram contain information relative absolute size set similar Euler diagram mentioned
However Venn diagram n component set must contain hypothetically possible zone correspond combination inclusion exclusion component set
The difference Euler diagram Venn diagram Euler diagram contain actually possible zone given context
In Venn diagram though shaded zone may represent empty zone
At time Euler diagram corresponding zone missing diagram
As example imagine one set representing dairy product another one cheese
In case Venn diagram contains zone cheese dairy product
Thus context cheese mean type dairy product Euler diagram cheese zone entirely contained within one zone cheese
In case Euler diagram typically le visually complex similar Venn diagram especially number intersection small
Once plan draw mentioned diagram including Venn one find useful tool allows make needed drawing within short period time necessary tool design element symbol always available ConceptDraw PRO user basic application rest needed solution always downloaded ConceptDraw STORE site

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

A tree hierarchical data structure
Generally tree consists value together pointer tree
For example could see class definition like Here child array pointer also hold value
At point child array empty make tree child base case recursive definition tree
When draw pointer line look like tree hence name
Here root node A
The child list A pointer B C Then child list C contains H I example The child list leaf node empty called leaf node see tree top
As might imagine tree useful representing hierarchy object
They also useful maintaining set number collection number subdivided smaller range hierarchically
A tree abstract data type node consists one element number upper bound tree node one one parent except root parent
The consequence two may equal ie content equivalent ca exactly one path node therefore loop
Since I specify rather arc tree I imply unidirectional flow specify
Really come thing tree defined parent therefore far tree concerned nothing go reverse direction
There formal abstract data type notation define tree general specific tree
These give form set notation lambda calculus formal version
It useful use formal notation eliminate ambiguity provide mean testing implementation ensure terminology consistent work across language
A plain English description good enough though
A different approach start graph collection node node point arbitrary number node arc may circular restrict spanning tree graph one path given point arc unidirectional
It produce different abstract form form start readily generalized
Finding effect two distinct ADTs always easy

A way modelling domain level detail much domain model
Inside design class diagram class become object Objects created according Object Class Definition
An Object Class definition type template creating object
It includes declaration attribute operation associated object class
In UML object class represented section object attribute object operation
An example shown using object class model If one thing Object Oriented way top section would declaration variable bottom section
Now going get bog fast warning hehe
Now part need read An exam contains different type question Using draw Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain
First thing first need identify Classes
Well quite obviously Classes straight top BUT look see
Well saw inherit something right inherit Question think one contain something variable operation etc etc really want write declaration time
But Multiple Choice question
They contain multiple answer surely need type could use Multiple Choice Question Options That mean class
So quick guidance Domain Model look like Here
Aside
I realised missed something im sooo sorry So yeah extra feature inside Design Class Diagram besides bleeding These extra feature forgot mention I think either leave comment email uni come bother hahaha OK go

A graphical representation flow data modelling aspect
A DFD often used preliminary step create overview system without going great detail later elaborated
DFDs also used structured design
A DFD show kind information input output system data advance system data stored
It show information process timing whether process operate sequence parallel unlike traditional structured focus control flow UML activity workflow diagram present control data flow unified model
In original developer structured design proposed data flow diagram practical technique based Martin Estrin Data Flow Graph model computation
Data flow diagram DFD quickly became popular way visualize major step data involved software system process
DFDs usually used show data flow computer system although could theory applied
DFDs useful document major data flow explore new design term data flow
Data flow diagram also known bubble chart
DFD designing tool used approach Systems Design
This DFD next exploded produce Level DFD show detail system modeled
The Level DFD show system divided process deal one data flow external agent together provide functionality system whole
It also identifies internal data store must present order system job show flow data various part system
Data flow diagram one three essential perspective analysis design method
The sponsor project end user need briefed consulted throughout stage system evolution
With data flow diagram user able visualize system operate system accomplish system implemented
The old system data flow diagram drawn compared new system data flow diagram draw comparison implement efficient system
Data flow diagram used provide end user physical idea data input ultimately effect upon structure whole system order dispatch report
How system developed determined data flow diagram model
In course developing set data flow diagram forced address system may decomposed component identify
Data flow diagram used Analysis Design phase
There different notation draw data flow diagram Yourdon Coad defining different visual representation process data store data flow external entity
A logical DFD capture data flow necessary system operate
It describes process undertaken data required produced process store needed hold data
On hand physical DFD show system actually implemented either moment Current Physical DFD designer intends future Required Physical DFD
Thus Physical DFD may used describe set data item appear piece paper move around office fact particular set piece paper stored together filing cabinet
It quite possible Physical DFD include reference data duplicated redundant data store implemented set would constitute relational database
In contrast Logical DFD attempt capture data flow aspect system form neither redundancy duplication

There many kind entity relationship model
The relationship classified following thing
Cardinality maximum minimum Degree binary ternary degree forth Entity type strong weak What different type classification
Do overlap tell u something unique entity relationship
Why important classify type ERD entity relationship diagram model
Kindly find enclosed document solution
An model graphical representation entity relationship typically used computing regard organization data within database information system
An entity piece data object concept data stored
A relationship hand data shared entity
The basic type connectivity entity relation
Each tell u
The basic type connectivity entity relation
Each tell u unique feature connectivity among entity ERD
This idea illustrated example given solution

An describes thing interest specific domain knowledge
An ER model composed entity type classify thing interest specifies relationship exist instance entity type
In ER model commonly formed represent thing business need remember order perform business process
Consequently ER model becomes abstract defines data information structure implemented typically
modeling developed database design published paper
However variant idea existed previously
Some ER modeler show super subtype entity connected relationship ER model used also specification
An model usually result systematic analysis define describe important process area business
It define business process present business data schema graphical form
It usually drawn graphical form box connected line express association dependency entity
An ER model also expressed verbal form example Entities may characterized relationship also additional property include identifier called primary key
Diagrams created represent attribute well entity relationship may called diagram rather model
An ER model typically implemented
In simple relational database implementation row table represents one instance entity type field table represents attribute type
In relationship entity implemented storing primary key one entity pointer foreign key table another entity There tradition model built two three level abstraction
Note hierarchy used kind specification different
The first stage design us model describe information need type stored
The technique used describe
overview classification used term relationship certain
In case design information system based database later stage usually called logical design mapped turn mapped physical model physical design
Note sometimes phase referred physical design
An may defined thing capable independent existence uniquely identified
An entity abstraction complexity domain
When speak entity normally speak aspect real world distinguished aspect real world
An entity thing exists either physically logically
An entity may physical object house car exist physically event house sale car service concept customer transaction order exist concept
Although term entity one commonly used following Chen really distinguish entity
An category
An entity strictly speaking instance given
There usually many instance
Because term somewhat cumbersome people tend use term entity synonym term
Entities thought
Examples computer employee song mathematical theorem
A relationship capture entity related one another
Relationships thought linking two noun
Examples relationship company computer relationship employee department relationship artist song relationship mathematician conjecture
The model linguistic aspect described utilized database ERROL mimic construct
ERROL implementation based RRA relational algebra adapted model capture linguistic aspect
Entities relationship attribute
Examples entity might SSN attribute relationship may attribute
Every entity unless must minimal set uniquely identifying attribute called entity
diagram show single entity single instance relation
Rather show entity set entity entity type relationship set relationship relationship type
Example particular entity
The collection song database entity set
The relationship child lunch single relationship
The set relationship database relationship set
In word relationship set corresponds relationship corresponds member relation
Certain relationship set may indicated well
Chen proposed following rule thumb mapping natural language description ER diagram Peter Chen
Physical view show data actually stored
In Chen original paper give example relationship role
He describes relationship marriage two role husband wife
A person play role husband marriage relationship another person play role wife marriage
These word noun
That surprise naming thing requires noun
Chen terminology also applied earlier idea
The line arrow diagram owes earlier Chen relationship diagram
Another common extension Chen model name relationship role verb phrase
It also become prevalent name role phrase
Correct noun case
Thus rather etc
The use noun direct benefit generating physical implementation semantic model
When two relationship possible generate name immediately meaningful
Modifications original specification beneficial
Chen described
As aside notation used Oracle Designer us minimum cardinality analogous optionality role maximum cardinality crow foot
In Elmasri Navathe others preference role minimum maximum cardinality
Recent researcher Feinerer Dullea et al
shown coherent applied relationship order greater
In Dullea et al
one read A across notation used UML effectively represent semantics participation constraint imposed relationship degree higher binary
In Feinerer say Problems arise operate semantics used UML association
Hartmann investigates situation show different transformation fail
also As see next page interpretation introduces several difficulty prevent extension simple mechanism binary association
Chen notation modeling us rectangle represent entity set diamond represent relationship appropriate attribute relationship
If entity set participates relationship set connected line
Attributes drawn oval connected line exactly one entity relationship set
Cardinality constraint expressed follows Attributes often omitted clutter diagram diagram technique often list entity attribute within rectangle drawn entity set
Related diagramming convention technique Crow foot notation beginning date back article Gordon Everest used SSADM
Crow foot diagram represent entity box relationship line box
Different shape end line represent cardinality relationship
Crow foot notation used consultancy practice
Many consultant CACI including Richard Barker subsequently moved UK developed early version Oracle tool introducing notation wider audience
With notation relationship attribute
Where necessary relationship promoted entity right example necessary capture artist performed song new entity performance introduced attribute reflecting time place relationship artist song becomes indirect relationship via performance
In using modeled database user encounter two well known issue returned result mean something result assumed query author
The first trap
It occurs master table linking multiple table relationship
The issue derives name way model look draw diagram linked table master table
This type model look similar type model used
When trying calculate sum aggregate using standard SQL master table get unexpected incorrect result explanation missing
The solution either adjust model SQL
This issue occurs mostly database decision support system software query system sometimes includes specific method handling issue
The second issue trap
A chasm trap occurs model suggests existence relationship entity type pathway exist certain entity occurrence
For example Building Rooms hold Computers
You would expect able query model see Computers Building
However Computers currently assigned Room repair somewhere else shown list
You need another relation Building Computers capture computer building
This last modelling issue result failure capture relationship exist real world model
See detail
A semantic model model concept sometimes called platform independent model
It intensional model
At latest since well known An extensional model one map element particular methodology technology thus platform specific model
The UML specification explicitly state association class model extensional fact considering extensive array additional adornment provided specification provided prior candidate semantic modelling language
Peter Chen father ER modeling said seminal paper In original article Chen explicitly contrast diagram record modelling technique Several author also support Chen program Chen accord philosophic theoretical tradition time Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates Plato Aristotle BC modern
associate knowledge apprehension unchanging Forms The form according Socrates roughly speaking archetype abstract representation many type thing property relationship one another

Entity Relationship Modeling common way express analytical result early stage construction new database Pedersen
data model used describe conceptual schema
It graphical notation based block connecting line used describe object relation among data model
In sense model mean describing data model
proposed Peter Chen American professor computer science Louisiana State University
widely used Database system
It convenient prototyping design information system database architecture computer application system model
With help possible identify key entity present model identify relationship may established entity
one simplest visual model data graphical notation
It allows defining structure large stroke general term
In conceptual database schema widely used CASE system supporting automated design relational database
Among great quantity notation one developed Unified Modeling Language UML
It used CASE system ORACLE
UML notation also used Borland Software Corporation University Bremen University Kent University York Dresden University Technology
In project LINUX Documentation presented comprehensive analysis structure Linux kernel version representation UML
In document basic subsystem kernel memory management filesystems security cryptography initialization driver architecture interprocess communication detailed description structure relationship component presented
So modeling way graphically representing logical relationship entity object order create database Ramakrishnan

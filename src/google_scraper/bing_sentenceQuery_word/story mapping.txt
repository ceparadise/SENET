In computer science two definition word map
The first associative array type container map value one type value another type
An example
The second definition functional programming map applies function take list function applies function element list order return list result
What origin different definition map
I guessing second definition might come I sure derived another useful
The first definition make intuitive sense I sure came
Both construct define map mathematical sense mapping element one set another
Well mathematical meaning pairing element one set another

In composed pair possible key appears collection
Operations associated data type allow The classic computer science problem task designing maintains set data operation
The two major solution dictionary problem
In case also possible solve problem using directly addressed specialized structure
Many programming language include associative array available many others
form direct support associative array
Associative array many application including fundamental
In associative array association key value often known binding word binding may also used refer process creating new association
The operation usually defined associative array Often instead add reassign single operation add new pair one already exist otherwise reassigns
In addition associative array may also include operation determining number binding constructing loop binding
Usually operation order binding returned may arbitrary
A generalizes associative array allowing multiple value associated single key
A related abstract data type binding operate direction value must associated unique key second lookup operation take value argument look key associated value
Suppose set loan made library represented data structure
Each book library may checked single library patron time
However single patron may able check multiple book
Therefore information book checked patron may represented associative array book key patron value
Using notation data structure would A lookup operation key Great Expectations would return John
If John return book would cause deletion operation Pat check book would cause insertion operation leading different state For dictionary small number binding may make sense implement dictionary using binding
With implementation time perform basic dictionary operation linear total number binding however easy implement constant factor running time small
Another simple implementation technique usable key restricted narrow range integer direct addressing array value given key stored array cell binding cell store special indicates absence binding
As well simple technique fast dictionary operation take constant time
However space requirement structure size entire keyspace making impractical unless keyspace small
The two major approach implementing dictionary
The frequently used general purpose implementation associative array combined separate key separate bucket array
The basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple operation
Therefore average overhead operation hash table computation key hash combined accessing corresponding bucket within array
As hash table usually perform O time outperform alternative situation
Hash table need able handle hash function map two different key bucket array
The two widespread approach problem
In separate chaining array store value store another container usually store value matching hash
On hand open addressing hash collision found table seek empty spot array store value deterministic manner usually looking next immediate position array
Open addressing lower ratio separate chaining table mostly empty
However table becomes filled element open addressing performance degrades exponentially
Additionally separate chaining us le memory case unless entry small le four time size pointer
Another common approach implement associative array
Compared hash table structure advantage weakness
The performance binary search tree significantly better hash table time complexity O log
This contrast hash table whose performance involves element sharing single bucket resulting O time complexity
In addition like binary search tree binary search tree keep element order
Thus traversing element follows pattern whereas traversing hash table result element seemingly random order
However hash table much better time complexity binary search tree O performance highly unlikely good used
It worth noting binary search tree used implement bucket hash table us separate chaining
This allows constant lookup assures performance O log
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element linked list similar data structure
Associative array may also stored unbalanced data structure specialized particular type key implementation method le efficient hash table well placing greater restriction type data handle
The advantage alternative structure come ability handle operation beyond basic one associative array finding binding whose key closest queried key query present set binding
Associative array implemented programming language package many language system provide part standard library
In language built standard system special syntax often using subscripting
syntactic support associative array introduced name table
made associative array optionally persistent key data structure
supported one possible implementation set map
Most modern scripting language starting including support associative array primary container type
In many language available library function without special syntax
In called called called see called since typically use implementation
In array associative except key limited integer string
In JavaScript see also object behave associative array key Map WeakMap type take arbitrary object key
In Lua called used primitive building block data structure
In called
The also support associative array
Most program using associative array point need store data permanent form like
A common solution problem generalized concept known produce text binary representation original object written directly file
This commonly implemented underlying object model like Cocoa include standard function convert internal data text form
The program create complete text representation group object calling method almost always already implemented base associative array class
For program use large data set sort individual file storage appropriate DB required
Some DB system natively store associative array serializing data storing serialized data key
Individual array loaded saved database using key refer
These used many year history long common RDBs lack standardization among reason limited use certain niche role
RDBs used role case although saving object RDB complicated problem known
After need high performance database suitable closely matching internal structure program using led renaissance store market
These system store retrieve associative array native fashion greatly improve performance common workflow

Jan Application Developer One key objective project inception collect requirement collaboratively
But many time difficult decide start focus
Story mapping engaging activity participant involved process building product backlog wall versus writing dull requirement Story mapping invented introduced I find effective useful tool capture requirement inception
Story mapping approach requirement gathering represented tree
Story mapping start overarching vision
A vision achieved via goal
Goals reached completing activity
And complete activity user need perform task
And task transformed user story software development
Story Map Structure Lets take example online store one goal build branch story map understand better To achieve goal multiple way product category text
Lets take one approach Â product category build story map complete activity reaching required product user need perform certain task task converted user story software development like continue deep dive branch story map starting goal build whole story map
In experience building full story map take day week based project size For reference sample branch story map real project full story map day activity looked like following Now learned build story map let look advantage
Sometime need information captured story map
nice story follow question alternative approach
This like enriching story map information
Following use case Â One alternative structure based
User driven approach help identify requirement user perspective
buyer seller administrator etc
The map structured Another alternative especially useful NFRs requirement use
Large project may require level story map
However smaller project Â level usually sufficient
Now convinced using story map next gig let look need get ready activity Â Story mapping effective inception tool create product backlog visually structured way
It help building shared understanding identify gap backlog see interdependency perform better relative sizing
Further also help slicing release planning activity
Many thanks review valuable feedback

A blog
We dedicated giving every student every school opportunity learn computer programming
Not day go I read article speech need invest STEM education invest future student national competitiveness etc
Every time I hear STEM Science Technology Engineering Math I wish could focus conversation computer science
Why
Because three reason I explain See chart
Computer science STEM field job student
The data come government comparing job data projection Bureau Labor Statistics student data National Science Foundation
In chart computer science categorized alongside mathematics separated distinction would even greater favor CS
Now look computer science see field annual job growth almost rate student graduating bachelor degree
Computing job growing every state every industry
show job software computing company core driver recovery
And picture show fraction growth opportunity
Across field STEM computer science occupation top highest demand list lowest unemployment rate across field
Computer science impacting everything banking retail manufacturing entertainment across every industry country enough computer scientist fill open job
Google diversity gap workforce
Both tell similar story tech company hire men woman
For year author STEM problem talk fixing gender gap STEM addressing education pipeline student STEM field
If ask parent student STEM mostly know
By contrast far people familiar term like biology chemistry
I ran Meanwhile huge disconnect meaning STEM depending audience
When politician businessmen leader talk importance STEM mostly referring new stuff new technology innovation advancement invention driving growth national competitiveness
But STEM translated practice public education system translate topic already taught today school algebra geometry calculus biology chemistry physic
One hundred percent US public school teach math science
But percent NOT teach computer science encouraged teach STEM increase funding STEM turn course already teach
I run nonprofit called focused bringing computer science school offering free curriculum support school want add course option
The biggest obstacle work enough school district administrator feel need teach computer science
They need hear parent important
If high school parent ask school district offer computer science proper course alongside algebra biology chemistry
Don ask technology computer STEM even coding
Ask computer science

I opportunity meet year
Ted among thing famously coined phrase
It scary analogy apt one
I seen developer struggle huge mismatch relational database model traditional object model
And solution come seem make problem worse
I agree Ted completely
There solution sure involve serious painful tradeoff
And worst part ca usually see consequence tradeoff much later development cycle
Ted posted
It long post
But unless veteran ORM war I highly recommend least skimming aware many pitfall run trying implement ORM solution
There lot magic bullet shortage naive developer
Ted post excellent authoritative little wordy I felt like I experiencing little slice Vietnam reading
Let skip directly summary end provides great list current future solution ORM problem Ted quickly posted addressed common criticism original post
If itchy left mouse finger poised comment link right may want read first
Personally I think either abandon relational database abandon object
If take O R equation
It may seem crazy abandon traditional Customer object abandon traditional Customer table picking one totally sane alternative complex quagmire class object code generation SQL stored procedure ORM solution typically leaf u
Both approach certainly valid
I tend err side camp I think

GLOSSARY Story mapping consists ordering along two independent dimension
The map arranges user activity along horizontal axis rough order priority order would describe activity explain behaviour system
Down vertical axis represents increasing sophistication implementation
Given story map arranged first horizontal row represents barebones usable version product
Working successive row flesh product additional functionality
User Story Mapping One intent practice avoid failure mode incremental delivery product could released composed feature principle high business value unusable functionally dependent feature lower value therefore deferred future release

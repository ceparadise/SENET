This information organized follows Region Country Employee name Last First Title Level
Salary USD For assignment write query produce result described
Accounting requires information produce invoice
For client invoicing controller must know following information last day month Client name Contract name Project Employees logged hour project first day current month last day current month Total number hour logged employee month Employee rate Total charge per employee
employee rate x employee hour worked Billing contact name address contract All information produced using query serve basis report
Do use view stored procedure conjunction query
For assignment
You may hardcode month number query
In real world would likely run report current month case would want use getdate function retrieve current date
Conversely might produce query stored procedure take given month argument return resultset
For assignment however assume report run April hardcode date query produce result
The HR department requires report provides information benefit information
Assume calendar year whereby new benefit allotment granted January must used December year
No carryover benefit allowed
Number benefit day allotted employee Number benefit day taken Number benefit day remaining calendar year Number holiday allotted employee Number holiday taken Number holiday remaining calendar year For assignment write query produce result described

As previous report real world would likely use getdate function determine current date run report beginning current year present time
For assignment however may hardcode year query retrieve data year
Project name Maximum allowed hour per project Total hour worked project Overage difference cap actual hour Project name Employees worked project Total hour worked project per employee For assignment write query separate query b
The result must reflect requirement described
The payroll department requires report employee logging hour per week legally required work per country stipulation
These employee paid overtime wage hour worked excess weekly stipulated hour

For purpose project design mean visual graphical design site well implementation detail underlie
Your design document describe finished site look like make work
There alternative view design prove helpful
This view design clear detailed complete could principle mail team abroad could implement website without consulting client
The idea leave nothing implicit unspoken understanding party
An important part design set image picture want page look like perhaps common element logo navbar
You create mockups favorite editor tool Photoshop Pixlr Illustrator Power Point etc
Once done save export web image format GIF JPEG PNG upload folder named folder shared team account
Here set mockup image
If received necessary image text client logo history organization feel free use dummy image text
Hopefully fill coding
For focus layout page size alignment font color border
You use image design document picture really worth word describing page layout
The final product design phase webpage contains structured essay combination text image mockup page
The document webpage contain component Note form JavaScript application using JavaScript process form data
Do get confused
You know writing JavaScript code
Here seen still see course
Please note item must constructed entirely copied external website Web though modify code class material
Once fulfill minimum requirement code allowed get code web source attribution incorporate certain advanced component
image gallery transition count part minimum requirement
Now know design document read following section get detail part document
Your design say create clear complete concise
Design includes organization navigation site
What page
How connected
What sequence step user need take common task
For example user often visit site find next game describe path follow get information
In case requirement user find looking quickly easily solution site organizational navigational scheme allows
Important process informed knowledge user behavioral pattern studied
An excellent description design choice contain reference pattern learned reading
Design also cover layout appearance page
To guide process go back reading lecture note layout strategy
Think bit target audience remember may certain disability thus design accessibility issue mind see reading
Also remember every user precisely size screen think page layout flexible still look okay variety size
Document decision make
Do afraid specific design wo allowed change mind later
You may change mind coding document document submit along code
See
Rather duplicating code element site appear multiple page handle repetitious item using shared file JavaScript code shared file using SSI
Repetitious element include thing like Depending project achieving modularity may large task
Therefore implementation modularity shared partner since assigning one partner may result uneven work load
In professional setting many people may involved implementing website designed
To avoid stepping one another implementation must planned determining order part built time
Some part may built early allow testing subsequent part depend
We also need deadline various part management need know far team behind schedule software project almost never time
Finally need determine build part everything get built nothing get assigned two people
In project even though team two issue arise
Ideally good plan allow two teammate work independently without meet constantly discus page
call page I link
like
Thus design document must also include
The plan must cover following Our intention plan helpful make sure
A good way organize information create table column file name file description one line description deadline assigned person item
The organizational scheme similar example point clearly concrete name file
Your document saved file named uploaded folder folder team account
Use subfolder store mockup file
Make sure image saved Web format GIF PNG JPEG Photoshop proprietary format size big
Be sure submitted web page
It surprisingly common student submit work missing broken image missing CSS like
You practiced skill homework far use
Use following URL check submission If mockups large width height use attribute make fit page make link clicked show image new page
See due date
The lateness policy may turn hour late penalty
Please make change document submission deadline
While need make change design plan go separate document submitted end coding phase
Thus keep track change document
Your document include component described section
Your mockups reflect text description page close possible coded page eventually look like
We look well mockups convey purpose goal website well whether appropriate intended audience
For example one target audience child well color font image general layout speak audience cheerful bright overcrowded etc
Your writing formal clear concise
You make sure error spelling grammar punctuation mechanic writing
These example drawn earlier semester course somewhat different may helpful
Here example project featured
Notice design document close final website change described code submitted

A sometimes called us one instruction obviating need
With judicious choice single instruction given infinite resource OISC capable manner traditional computer multiple instruction
OISCs recommended aid teaching computer architecture used computational model structural computing research
In memory location store arbitrary integer depending model may arbitrarily many location
The instruction reside memory sequence integer
There exists class single instruction based bit manipulation
Since memory model finite memory structure used real computer bit manipulation machine equivalent real computer rather Turing machine
Currently known OISCs roughly separated three broad category machine simplest class
A bit copying machine called BitBitJump copy one bit memory pass execution unconditionally address specified one operand instruction
This process turn capable
able execute algorithm interpret universal machine copying bit conditionally modify code subsequently executed
Another machine called Toga computer inverts bit pass execution conditionally depending result inversion
Yet another bit operating machine similar BitBitJump copy several bit time
The problem solved case keeping predefined jump table memory
Transport Triggered Architecture TTA design computation side effect data transport
Usually memory register triggering port within common address space perform assigned operation instruction reference
For example OISC using single copy instruction done triggering port perform arithmetic instruction pointer jump written
machine use arithmetic operation conditional jump
Like two previous universal computer class also
The instruction operates integer may also address memory
Currently several known OISCs class based different arithmetic operation The last oldest popular arguably efficient
Common choice single instruction Only instruction used given implementation
Hence need opcode identify instruction execute choice instruction inherent design machine OISC typically named instruction us SBN OISC SUBLEQ language etc
Each instruction used construct OISC
This article present instruction among transport triggered
However possible construct Turing complete machine using instruction based arithmetic operation addition
For example one variation known DLN Decrement jump zero two operand us decrement base operation
For information see Subleq derivative language
The instruction ubtract ranch ot equal ero subtracts content address content address store result address transfer control address result equal zero execution proceeds next instruction sequence
The instruction SUbtract Branch Less EQual zero subtracts content address content address store result address transfer control address result positive execution proceeds next instruction sequence
Conditional branching suppressed setting third operand equal address next instruction sequence
If third operand written suppression implied
A variant also possible two operand internal accumulator subtracted memory location specified first operand
The result stored accumulator memory location second operand specifies branch address Although us two instead three operand per instruction correspondingly instruction needed effect various logical operation
It possible synthesize many type instruction using instruction
Unconditional branch Addition performed repeated subtraction conditional branching following instruction result content location added content location The first instruction subtracts content location content location store result negative content location
The second instruction subtracts result storing difference sum content originally third instruction restores value
A copy instruction implemented similarly following instruction result content location getting replaced content location assuming content location maintained Any desired arithmetic test built
For example condition assembled following instruction also used synthesize instruction although generally requires operation given task
For example fewer instruction required flip bit given byte The following program written emulates execution OISC This program assumes indexed integer
Consequently instruction program interprets executed branch halting condition
Similar interpreter written language may use allowed nature instruction found external link
There called written Oleg Mazonka compiles simplified C program code
The instruction SUbtract Branch NEGative also called defined similarly Conditional branching suppressed setting third operand equal address next instruction sequence
If third operand written suppression implied
It possible synthesize many type instruction using instruction
For simplicity one synthesized instruction shown illustrate difference
Unconditional branch location previously set contain positive integer respectively Unconditional branching assured initially contains value le integer stored
A instruction required clear branching assuming content must maintained
In Reverse Subtract Skip Borrow RSSB instruction subtracted memory location next instruction skipped borrow memory location smaller accumulator
The result stored accumulator memory location
The mapped memory location
The accumulator mapped memory location
To set x value minus z A transport triggered architecture us instruction hence originally called move machine
This instruction move content one memory location another memory location sometimes written Arithmetic performed using ALU jump performed using PC
A commercial transport triggered architecture microcontroller produced called MAXQ hide apparent inconvenience OISC using transfer map represents possible destination instruction

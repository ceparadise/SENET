The rule Functional Size Measurement Method IFPUG standard Function Point Analysis Method CPM Unadjusted often referred IFPUG Function Point Analysis FPA
Functional Size Measurement FSM technique measuring software term functionality delivers
The standard Functional Size Measurement defines FSM mean quantifying Functional User Requirements
function user required delivered
The Functional Size used many purpose
However primarily used planning stage input project resource estimation algorithm cost effort schedule
At completion project used compare performance term cost effectiveness efficiency development support team
FSM measure functional requirement software
This mean applied development commences rather retrospectively case form software measurement counting line code physical object
This capability measure early enables accurate estimate made risk evaluated project scope negotiated final commitment made
FSM also enables comparison application project based size
Productivity rate application similar attribute profile compared benchmarking improvement purpose
Productivity rate past project also used predict effort project Functional Size determined
FSM used size software work product
This work product output software new development enhancement project
It software migrated production application project implementation
FPA IFPUG method functionally sizing commonly used Functional Size technique
The second common method sizing real time control software
IFPUG FPA used since late ass functionality delivered user based user external business view functional requirement
It measure logical view application compared measuring physically implemented view internal technical view
FPA measure functional requirement term The process performing Function Point Analysis called Point Count involves component
The weighting combined give functional size Unadjusted Function Point Count
An additional step involves assessing technical quality feature embedded software product adjusting functional size accordingly
The result referred Adjusted Function Point Count
The Function Point Analysis technique used ass functionality delivered software point unit measurement
The technique functional modelling functional functional decomposition used model relationship application whole

Software project notorius going past deadline going budget
The problem lie estimation amount effort required development project
The cost estimation usually dependent upon size estimate project may use line code function point metric see
There several different technique performing software cost estimation including expert judgement algorithmic model
Estimation expert judgement common way estimating effort required project
Unfortunately method estimation emphasize project life cycle important part project tracking allows estimate improved project life cycle
The quality cost estimation model much attributed initial estimate rather speed estimate converges actual cost project
COCOMO popular algorithmic model cost estimation whose cost factor tailored individual development environment important accuracy cost estimate
More one method cost estimation done comparison available estimate
This especially important unique project
Cost estimation must done diligently throughout project life cycle future fewer surprise unforseen delay release product
Studies within last year shown great deal money often spent project initially anticipated
IBM Consulting Group survey leading company found software developed cost initial cost estimate
The Standish Group also study project United States found software project completed cost original estimate
Although number year ago likely changed much recently
The problem making accurate cost estimate attributed number reason wrong cost estimation process may used process may used nature problem may allow accurate cost estimation
Cost estimation often overlooked project management practice
Cost estimation defined approximate judgement cost project
Cost estimation never exact science many variable involved calculation cost estimate human technical environmental political
Futhermore process involves significant human factor never exact human far complex entirely predictable
Furthermore software development project inevitably include number task complexity difficult judge complexity software system
Cost estimation usually measured term effort
The common metric used person month year man month year
The effort amount time one person work certain period time
It important specific characteristic development environment taking account comparing effort two project two development environment
A clear example difference development environment amount time people work different country typical workweek North America hour per week Europe typical workweek hour per week
Thus comparing project North America project Europe conversion factor would used accurate comparison
Different variable used cost estimation lead difficulty comparing project standard model tool used
For example cost estimate include factor management development training quality assurance area specific organization
Cost estimation important tool affect planning budgeting project
Because finite number resource project feature requirement document often included final product
A cost estimate done beginning project help determine feature included within resource constraint project time
Requirements prioritized ensure important feature included product
The risk project reduced important feature included beginning complexity project increase size mean opportunity mistake development progress
Thus cost estimation big impact life cycle schedule project
Cost estimation also important effect resource allocation
It prudent company allocate better resource experienced personnel costly project
Manpower loading term used measure number engineering management personnel allocated project given amount time
Most time worse company costly project fails le costly project fails
When tool used estimation management developer even experiment trading resource factor others keeping cost project constant
For example one tradeoff may invest powerful integrated development environment number personnel working project could reduced
Cost estimation large impact project planning management
Cost estimation done throughout entire life cycle
The first time cost estimation done beginning project requirement outlined
Cost estimation may even done beginning project
For example several company may bid contract based preliminary initial requirement company win bid second round estimation could done refined detailed requirement
Doing cost estimation entire life cycle allows refinement estimate data available
Periodic way gauge progress project whether deadline able met
Effective monitoring control software cost required verification improvement accuracy estimate
Tools available help organize manage cost estimate data captured development process
People le likely gather data process cumbersome tedious using tool efficient easy use save time
It always expensive tool best tool buy rather tool suited development environment
Some thought given level detail metric gathered well planning metric may used future comparison project
The metric gathered highly dependent upon organization development organizational practice
The success cost estimate method necessarily accuracy initial estimate rather rate estimate converge actual cost
An organization great deal contract work would place importance initial estimate
However general method better converges quickly actual cost project
At end project estimation method opportunity converge actual cost enough information available
The people cost estimate could either directly indirectly responsible implementation project developer manager respectively
Someone knowledge organization previous project could use approach compare current project previous project common method estimation small organization small project
The historical data often limited memory estimator
In case estimator would need experienced would likely company awhile
Some people believe better estimate done outsider le chance bias
It true people outside organization likely deal fewer company politics people within organization
For example developer company may want please manager give estimate
The disadvantage outside estimate person would le knowledge development environment especially person outside company
An empirical method estimation would required Constructive Cost Model COCOMO discussed detail
Empirical method estimation used type estimator
There may resistance using empirical method estimation may question whether model could outperform expert
People accurate estimator rare experience best get opinion several people tool
To give reader better idea software cost estimation fit development process outline general step cost estimation
The step numbered completely discrete one another
As well although generally follow logical order step fit several part development process
Although may first seem confusing step straightforward enough difficulty envisioning fit development process
The first important step establish cost estimate plan
In plan stated data gathered data gathered goal cost estimation process
Determining data gathered essentially stating level detail metric
This decision influence amount decomposition task
There obviously point gathering data used
This seem unnecessary require work people collect manage data
Although may seem like good idea gather metric used near future could possibly used future waste resource time
A fair amount thought put cost estimation plan much like requirement project
The second step perform cost estimation based requirement
Decomposition project done time lower level abstraction needed data
Keep mind important use one method estimation perfect technique
If wide variance estimate method information used make estimate
During lifecycle done allow refinement cost estimate
The could done major milestone project specific time interval
This decision depend situation
Changes may made project cost estimate either increase decrease
At end project final assessment result entire cost estimation process done
This allows company refine estimation process future data point obtained also allows developer review development process
In order understand end result output software cost estimation process must first understand software cost estimation process
By definition software cost estimation process set technique procedure used derive software cost estimate
There usually set input process process us input generate calculate set output
Most software cost estimation model view estimation process function computed set cost driver
And cost estimation technique primary cost driver important cost driver believed software requirement
As illustrated figure classical view software estimation process software requirement primary input process also form basis cost estimation
The cost estimate adjusted accordingly number cost driver arrive final estimate
So cost driver
Cost driver anything may affect cost software
Cost driver thing design methodology risk assessment personnel experience programming language system complexity
In classical view estimation process generate three output effort duration loading
The following brief description output The output loading duration effort usually computed fixed number without tolerance classical view
But reality cost estimation process complex shown figure
Many data input process modified refined software cost estimation process
In actual cost estimation process input constraint needed considered besides cost driver
One primary constraint software cost estimate financial constraint amount money budgeted allocated project
There constraint manpower constraint date constraint
Other input architecture defines component made system interrelationship component
Some company certain software process existing architecture place hence company software cost estimation must base estimate criterion
There case software requirement stay fixed
Hence deal software requirement change ambiguity inconsistency
During estimation process experienced estimator detect ambiguity inconsistency requirement
As part estimation process estimator try solve ambiguity modifying requirement
If ambiguity inconsistent requirement stay unsolved correspondingly affect estimation accuracy
The cost estimation accuracy help determine well accurate estimation using particular model technique
We ass performance software estimation technique Each error calculation technique advantage disadvantage
For example absolute error fails measure size project mean magnitude relative error mask systematic bias know estimation
This software cost estimation technique use mathematical equation perform software estimation
The mathematical equation based historical data theory
SLOC source line code function point cost driver input
For algorithmic model calibration specific software environment performed improve estimation
Examples parametric model COCOMO COnstructive COst MOdel COCOMO II Putnam software model SLIM
Advantages Disadvantages COCOMO stand Constructive Cost Model software cost estimation model first published Barry Bohem
It algorithmic approach estimating cost software project
By using COCOMO calculate amount effort time schedule project
From calculation find much staffing required complete project time
COCOMO main metric used calculating value line code denoted KLOC COCOMO II KDSI COCOMO measured thousand function point FP object point OP
There different version COCOMO two discussed report COCOMO COCOMO II
The equation COCOMO based also shown however real world use would likely use one free commercial COCOMO tool available
COCOMO doubt popular method software cost estimation
The estimation relatively easy hand
There also tool available allow calculate complex estimation
Calibration COCOMO one important thing need done order get accurate estimation
Even though COCOMO may popular estimation method recommended always use another method estimation verify result
The method differ significantly COCOMO
This way project examined one angle something may overlooked using COCOMO overlooked
Although estimation one common method estimation lightweight nature method suffers highly dependent upon competent estimator
On hand empirical estimation method use large database data point
COCOMO popular empirical estimation model incorporated several tool
Any model calibrated development environment development environment different
In end accurate estimate guaranteed using one method estimation recommended verification estimate

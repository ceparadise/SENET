What role stack microprocessor
Stack used largely function call depending language level programming may used temporarily store processor register data variable
Further stack may also used storage data using store partial data stack call
The And yes stack also used
Its nature carrying called function return back coupled weakness check language give nice way cause stack vulnerable unsafely written program
At lowest level stack place certain instruction store retrieve data data stored interrupt occurs
Microprocesors vary general type instruction When processor interrupt occurs due external device CPU save current program counter usually flag register stack jump handling subroutine
This allows handling subroutine process interrupt return whatever CPU current state preserved
While microprocessor one stack active time operating system make appear multiple stack
At least one OS one process one thread
In fact thread may implement multiple stack
At higher level whatever language used implement thread often use stack purpose store functional call parameter local variable function call return value speaking broad stroke consult language documentation specific detail
Thus concludes explanation stack
In ancient time subroutine call handled word memory RAM subroutine indicate called
To call subroutine one would something like This pattern might optimized caller place return address register routine store return spot entry
This pattern worked problem
Not generally waste memory also mean dealing recursive code
Adding stack made possible simplify code caller simply say store return address someplace suitable without disturbing earlier one called function simply say return recent caller returned yet
This allowed development code meant necessary store enough return address handle deepest nested chain function call would ever actually occur
It depends microprocessor
Generally role keeping local variable function parameter
And actually microprocessor central memory
Stack used function call
Its put good use nested function call recursive function call
It also used
On microprocessor also used context switch
cheer Some microprocessor improve efficiency take look wikipedia others microstack microroutines
It wide term fact
The stack temporary store data
The CPU may PUSH important data onto stack processing data
When finish task PULLS saved data stack
Its like pile plate
The bottom plate first bit data pushed onto stack
The top plate last data pushed
The top plate pulled first bottom plate last data pulled
It LAST IN FIRST OUT stack
In diagram X first pushed Y lastly A
The CPU go away process data
Upon completion task return pull saved data
First A pulled Y lastly X
The instruction pushing data PHA
Only data accumulator pushed onto stack
Other data pushed transferred accumulator first
The instruction pulling data stack PLA
Data stack transferred accumulator
The stack consists byte occupies page address
Just add answer micros PIC line callstack mean dynamically allocated hardware
The implication go many function call deep run stack true software also course often hardware based stack limiting require rethink program order function call
A stack implementation LIFO Last In First Out buffer
The FIFO First In First Out also known queue
But back LIFO
Stacks architecture allow software designer dispense strange stuff return address register interrupt return address register found RISC processor
reside stack mean single standardized unified method handling variable return
The use method separate stack simplifies implementation
RISC contrast us buffer though keep significatnt part related info elsewhere
RISC stack may faster sure definitely difficult understand
Actually stack teminology processor used language routine call
A routine use stack get parameter save local variable also call routine

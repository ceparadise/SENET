Iteration context computer programming process wherein set instruction structure repeated sequence specified number time condition met
When first set instruction executed called iteration
When sequence instruction executed repeated manner called loop
Iteration repetition process computer program usually done help loop
An example iteration programming language follows Consider database table containing student record
Each record contains following field If one want copy student record database print best way retrieve record iterate loop record
It executed using loop statement shown int first name last name table In example iterator starting first student record last student record

act repeating process either generate unbounded sequence outcome aim approaching desired goal target result
Each repetition process also called iteration result one iteration used starting point next iteration
In context iteration along related technique standard building block
mathematics may refer process
applying function repeatedly using output one iteration input next
Iteration apparently simple function produce complex behaviour difficult problem example see
Another use iteration mathematics used produce approximate numerical solution certain mathematical problem
example iterative method
Manual calculation number square root common use example
computing technique marking block statement within defined number repetition
That block statement said computer scientist might also refer block statement iteration
The pseudocode example iteration line code bracket loop iterate three time It permissible often necessary use value part program outside bracketed block statement perform desired function
In example line code using value increment
In school iteration used describe process teaching guiding student repeat experiment assessment project accurate result found student mastered technical skill
This idea found old adage Practice make perfect
In particular iterative defined process learning development involves cyclical inquiry enabling multiple opportunity people revisit idea critically reflect implication
Unlike computing math educational iteration predetermined instead task repeated success according external criterion often test achieved
In algorithmic situation recursion iteration employed effect
The primary difference recursion employed solution without prior knowledge many time action repeat successful iteration requires foreknowledge
Some type programming language known designed set block statement explicit repetition loop
Instead programming language exclusively use
Rather call block code repeated number time executing code block instead divide work done number separate piece code block executes individual piece
Each piece work divided repeatedly amount work small possibly point algorithm work quickly
The algorithm revers reassembles piece complete whole
The classic example recursion algorithm
The Merge Sort recursive algorithm first repeatedly divide list consecutive pair pair ordered consecutive pair pair forth element list desired order
The code example recursive algorithm programming language output result pseudocode previous heading
In object ensures iteration executed way range different data structure saving time effort later coding attempt
An abstraction accepts reject data iteration

The past week I learning iterators
I still understand main difference iterating link list traversing one
I know traversing mean go visiting every element link list iterating basically thing different iterate everything standard library
mean walking element data structure
Historically computer science special form recursion additional stack space needed word
This form computationally exactly equivalent colloquially know namely finite loop loop fixed lower upper bound
Now make iteration especially well suited compared general recursion traversing linear data structure
Note work container
general graph need remember already visited node
using defined recursively term adjacent node rather via concept iterators
It context term used applied container
In summary every traversal iteration every iteration data structure traversal
However worth noting many people make distinction use term interchangeably
In particular usage Gerald Sussman fame
But seemingly data structure tree linearised purpose iteration applying thus traversed stack
Note I made definition fit mental model I going
Iteration discrete traversal may may
So traverse range allowable volume analog volume knob speaker iterate
But iteration type traversal
So every iteration traversal every traversal iteration
AFAIK synonymous
What make think difference
I feel traverse sometimes used indicate internal structure exploited
You traverse tree going parentnodes childnodes traverse list following next pointer
An array hand iterate
You element work one one
I would call agent action
Actually often confuses people refer something something related numerical method converging towards mathematical point via iteration
On hand even I use word interchangeably
You container concept
At minimum order something need know least whether neighbor get
A iterator basically give functionality traverse datastructure visiting every element
I would call synonym
There I know programming
Some datastructures information allows
For example stack able traverse though element access top stack

I planning teach course mobile application development
I thinking best way structure course starting believe agile approach might merit
The idea The student senior junior one deliverable course end written mobile application make use web service location service graphical information display mobile database
Also student able use version control appropriate amount software design perform review others code incorporate automated manual testing project
Because nearing end study I believe showing real world agile project might work scope currently studying would good secondary goal
My question So look like based school calendar enough time introductory session four sprint final demo session two floating session available work
So two approach Assume product student knowledge mobile application development student select item generic backlog work sprint
Assume product mobile app must term functionality student define app produce user story
This seen Buffy noted
If done properly might case aim fill student knowledge gap
That need highly adaptive per student probably per topic area
If I product owner I get say whether met acceptance criterion know enough topic user story
If instead get another student product owner perhaps QA delegation PO idea pairing brought student come mutual understanding definition done
If product mobile application simplifies thing make agile approach closer software engineer would follow real work environment
Here I product owner I need understand possible apps student get choose app idea
Again might better delegated another student group student
Do subvert purpose essence agile development ability product owner project almost instantly make change adjustment backlog business condition dictate
The alternative specifying everything start failed repeatedly long running project make sense whatever follow initial plan
Some I write assumes future reader familiar terminology purpose various role task
To try complete would require
So You need separate developer group Devs product owner PO person group
I normally randomly thing might work
The PO control backlog release feature per iteration
The developer see whole thing overview form start
If want Devs estimation agile per iteration currently relevant card feature
Then give PO velocity determine many feature iteration
If project one term iteration short week
small
But even estimate time per task still give velocity seen feature desired
Otherwise frustrated much work little time
That lead burnout agile
The downside PO get develop
That may advantage depending makeup student group
I prefer PO I throw kink two along way
As say need prevent speculative development
You fierce rejecting attempt
Not showing entire backlog help simply rejecting feature produced speculatively needed
The problem student likely gotten one bad habit
They probably past given partly specified project assignment creativity valued
So try get creative definition ignoring need PO
In real world seldom work way Startups excepted need learn work someone else vision
So need make work class
The following speculative I tried
If really want every student experience every role Appoint PO somehow first iteration hold role throughout
Accepting rejecting guidance backlog item completed
Then end iteration rotate role old PO becomes developer student take PO role
They need time become familiar backlog however probably ca happen iteration end one day new PO take specifies next iteration immediately
A negative aspect old PO knowledge would reality may make eager speculate
I would also require skill sorry US baseball term Extreme Programming suggests

personal skill pairing test first etc
Pairing help teach one another build team skill
Another possibility course Agile Development though match stated requirement follows
I say others may benefit
Instead one large project bunch tiny project minute feature minute iteration
If run course hour segment made work
In fact I know one outfit sort thing real
large project maybe one hour iteration
With scheme person PO one project take different role next day
At point agile course trying realistic need throw sorry
Change fundamental way
Estimate current move usual
It really happens way experience also show word agile actually mean something
Trying make initial requirement precise also encourage speculation
Real agile project work way
The initial backlog pretty vague specification
It approach iteration feature appears becomes specific
You need guide PO sensible thing
You probably need project Coach
If need ease development could provide test unit test guide developer
After initially take
But need give advice coach quality test
Note I merged idea Scrum XP
Scrum work well overall management Backlogs acceptance XP day day task pairing testing
If require level skill student probably thrash
Agile requires discipline often missed especially reject
There say course
But bottom line need
The biggest issue I see taking curriculum trying approach using SCRUM term
The result lot almost SCRUM behavior could tremendously damaging
I seen many SCRUM team fail Product Owner Scrum Master forced almost SCRUM mentality team
Instead taking curriculum trying approach SCRUM term I recommend starting trying apply curriculum
The reason I think work better SCRUM designed produce product learning curriculum
Your curriculum necessarily designed operate SCRUM
Let SCRUM take charge good
One key aspect application going wear three hat Product Owner Scrum Master Manager
Manager actually SCRUM role essential stability
If real life SCRUM team refuse build sprint support Product Owner sufficiently That PO talk functional management team everyone receiving bad performance review year
The equivalent given bad grade
Thus support SCRUM process line item grade student
Maybe tell student first grade free unless disrupt SCRUM process enough force PO talk manager
If coach right think free A test something like
With ugly manager hat way look one
Product Owner interesting
Like industry PO obligation produce product customer administration child parent expect learning
Explain student wearing PO hat job deliver curriculum expectation customer
I would expect two major style behavior
If student curriculum PO operate like product owner would egging team produce product faster maybe giving freedom craft backlog way want see
However student falling behind
PO may able deliver learning customer student ameliorating sprint PO start tightening rein offering le agility instead picking way cover material probably boring talking Manager SCRUM grade
The student understand front
If start fall behind desire part resolve issue PO come take away freedom
It easy enough understand knowing game work key
Then Scrum Master
The SM known team
They facilitate team way needed make SCRUM team successful
Note different job description PO
You going need make clear acting SM acting PO
This might actually involve funny headgear might involve metacommunicating tell people acting
As example let recognize SCRUM effort experiment
It might actually fit well school model
What happens bad match
The first thing notice PO start get unhappy delivering learning
You falling behind schedule
The PO going push team produce
As SM need work try plan better sprint meet PO need
Now case looking case fails
Now PO extremely unhappy ready talk Manager bad team performing take away SCRUM support grade
At point might need metacommunication recover So I wanted try run class SCRUM setting
As seen email guy Product Owner I happy result
Your SCRUM effort simply working
At point real Product Owner real Scrum Master would sit talk going
They try identify root cause
So Scrum Master group I come table arguing team actually job task big
At point semester I Product Owner agree Scrum Master
You guy done job making SCRUM work best could
The curriculum fit
So Product Owner I deciding terminate SCRUM go back traditional teaching approach
Since clear guy job making work I going Manager try ding guy performance
You great
You get SCRUM support point
But instead part scrum going like Test
It like test study got A
Congratulations
Now back regularly scheduled classroom
Can see murky would blurred hat
It need clear process least person corner Scrum Master
If ca see may rebel idea
Now sprint planning last major challenge I think
There issue
One many people team
SCRUM team work best small number
A classroom likely many
You probably adapt sprint planning process fit reality
The challenge planning student expert
You
They really know enough break backlog item task fit sprint
As result may help
As part Product Backlog may want provide suggestion approach curriculum item Lecture Problem set A Problem set B Research along way estimating long task take
Let assign story point essential learning process SCRUM
If want try learn curriculum different way provided may need introduce concept Sprint Goal explain use provide cohesion
Also remember flexibility
As PO going demonstrate customer student learned material
That
If work find clever way demonstrate learning need learn always let deviate obvious curriculum
If teaching socket really need backlog item Learn use
Or add new item use asynchronous thread add functionality awesome product produced last sprint
The answer really depends much freedom curriculum
The main problem probably
Some pupil see product backlog start working ahead time This good far probably work time AHHH
Therefore release backlog start
Insure teach Work In ProgressÂ bad keep releasing
There may learning dependency mean item delivered early
If pupil chose would problem
Therefore carefully choose initial set backlog contains item suitable early stage
But later dependency considered student could mark invisible one backlog aware
You could Give agile A Bad Name
Ensure know Agile well
I worked many developer say work I tried They tried someone heard Agile good relabelled bad practice Or learn properly made something

In function function obtained another function certain number time
The process repeatedly applying function called
In process starting initial number result applying given function fed function input process repeated
Iterated function object study mathematics physic
The formal definition iterated function follows
Let set
Define iterate integer denotes
That always
Because notation may refer iteration composition function latter commonly used mathematician choose write iterate function
In general following identity hold integer This structurally identical property
special case
In general arbitrary general negative etc
index relation called cf

On logarithmic scale reduces since
The relation also hold analogous property exponentiation
The sequence function called named
For given value called
If integer orbit called
The smallest value given called
The point called
The problem computer science problem finding first periodic point orbit period orbit
If period orbit called iterated sequence
The set fixed point often denoted
There exist number guarantee existence fixed point various situation including
There several technique sequence produced
For example applied iterated fixed point known produce quadratic convergence
Upon iteration one may find set shrink converge towards single point
In case point converged known
Conversely iteration may give appearance point diverging away single point would case
When point orbit converge one limit set orbit known
The idea attraction repulsion generalize similarly one may categorize iterates according behaviour small iteration
Also see
Other limiting behaviour possible example point move away never come back even close started
In instance fractional iteration function defined instance function function
This function written using index notation
Similarly function defined may defined equal forth based principle mentioned earlier
This idea generalized iteration count becomes sort continuous time continuous
In case one refers system specified
cf
Section
Negative iterates correspond function inverse composition
For example normal inverse inverse composed

Fractional negative iterates defined analogously fractional positive one example defined equivalently
One several method finding series formula fractional iteration making use fixed point follows
This carried indefinitely although inefficiently latter term become increasingly complicated
A systematic procedure outlined following section
For example setting give fixed point formula terminates trivial check
Find value done time possibly interpolated value integer
We
A fixed point
So set expanded around fixed point value infinite series taking first three term correct first decimal place

Using fixed point cause series diverge
For series computes inverse function
With function expand around fixed point get series simply Taylor series expanded around
If two iterated function exists said
Clearly topological conjugacy preserved iteration
Thus one solve one iterated function system one also solution topologically conjugate system
For example topologically conjugate
As special case taking one iteration Making substitution yield Even absence strict homeomorphism near fixed point taken one may often solve function make locally conjugate mere dilation Thus iteration orbit flow suitable provision amount conjugate orbit monomial expression serf plain exponent Here however exponent longer need integer positive continuous time evolution full orbit Picard sequence cf
generalized full
This method perturbative determination principal cf
equivalent algorithm preceding section albeit practice powerful systematic
If function linear described matrix whose row column sum one iterated system known
There
iterated function include
worked special case chaotic case hence
A nonchaotic case Schröder also illustrated method yielded hence
If group element set iterated function corresponds
Most function explicit general iterate
The table list
Note expression valid even negative well positive integer
Note two special case case solution
Choosing respectively reduces nonchaotic chaotic logistic case discussed prior table
Some example related among simple conjugacies
A example essentially amounting simple conjugacies Schröder example found ref
Iterated function studied
In iterated function occur special case turn anchor study broad topic narrower one computer program
Two important defined term iterated function
These equivalent product The iterated function given recursive formula Iterated function crop series expansion combined function
Given iterate function For example rigid advection
Consequently action plain
Conversely one may specify given arbitrary generic discussed This evident noting For continuous iteration index written subscript amount Lie celebrated exponential realization continuous group The initial flow velocity suffices determine entire flow given exponential realization automatically provides general solution

How create array VTL add content array
Also retrieve content array index
According right hand side assignment type You create empty list would satisfy need array Apache Velocity template expression like initialize value add element using Java add method beware Java method list type return boolean value add element list Velocity print instance true false based result add function
A simple work around assigning result add function variable You access element list using index number Expression would show span text string
However safest way access element list using foreach loop
Creating array easy Putting element array also easy Getting element array depends Velocity version
In Velocity must use Since Velocity use classic form I created array VTL passed array VTL context used
In VTL retrieve array content index use foreach example code copied Dynamic SQL generation VTL Script For reason also array
When I needed array store object row I used workaround defining new class putting object class single dimensional array

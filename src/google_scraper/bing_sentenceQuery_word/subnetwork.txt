A subnet small network inside larger network
It logical grouping connected network device tend located close physical proximity local area
There plenty time large network might need smaller network inside
A simple example large company network subnets human resource accounting department
Network designer employ subnets way partition network logical segment greater ease administration
When subnets properly implemented performance improved
A single IP address large business network may accept message file outside computer must decide company hundred thousand computer office receive
Subnetting give network logical tier organization identify correct path within company
Subnetting process dividing network two subnets
An IP address number identify network ID host ID
A subnet address borrows bit host ID IP address
Subnetting largely invisible computer user also network administrator
Any office school large number computer enjoy
They include There many disadvantage subnetting
The process likely require additional router switch hub expense
Also need experienced network administrator manage network subnets
You may need set subnet computer network
Unless network administration process bit complex
It probably best hire tech professional set subnet
However want try hand check
There error
Please try

A subnetwork subnet separate identifiable portion organization network typically local area network LAN comprised machine one floor building geographical location
Having several subnets allows organization connected Internet shared network address mean machine given subnet prefix IP address
The practice dividing network subnets called subnetting
The subnetting process involves separating network subnet portion IP address host identifier consists network prefix subnet number also called subnet mask host number
The network prefix identifies entire network subnet number identifies portion entire subnetwork host number identifies host computer
Data traffic subnets controlled gateway computer called router act physical border subnets

Subnet mask used determine belongs
An IP address two component network address address
For example consider IP address
Assuming part Class B network first two number represent Class B network address second two number identify particular host network
Subnetting enables network administrator divide host part address two subnets
In case part host address reserved identify particular subnet
This easier see show IP address binary format
If network divided subnets however first bit host address reserved identifying subnet
The subnet mask network address plus bit reserved identifying subnetwork convention bit network address set though would also work bit set exactly network address
In case therefore subnet mask would
It called used identify subnet IP address belongs performing mask IP address
The result subnetwork address The subnet address therefore
An IP subnet mask calculator used automatically calculate subnets
The calculator allows input IP address choose Subnet Mask Network class variable calculate subnet network mask
Results calculation provide hexadecimal IP address wildcard mask subnet ID broadcast address subnet address range resulting subnet network

I trouble understanding point Subnet Masks
I reading nice article topic left bit confused
When I first heard Subnets explained small independent network connected main internet one point
For example office building would subnet thousand computer instead wasting thousand regular IP address
However article seems subnet collection computer IP address subnet mask used describe bit one range subnetwork
Example article So point
We still save IP address I want contact Dave Bill I still send message
How subnets make life easier contribute anything
The main benefit size routing table
Instead store entry every machine network need store entry particular subnet
For example ISP might anyone sending packet outside machine subnet need know route border
Their border router fine grained view subnet probably split many subnets know router network send packet based smaller subnet belongs
Thus subnets provides level abstraction OUTSIDE
Not INSIDE seemed expected
EDIT Here simplified example
Assume large ISP network
Within large network two smaller network
To reach system either two smaller network system outside need know address border router
Once packet reach router managing router know get
Finally home router even need know address router
It blindly send packet router home ISP assuming larger router know get typically called default
Here way think
Think train station get city A B
When look map train station city A tell train take get city B
However map tell get final destination city B
However city B probably find detailed map tell get final destination within city B need access map still city A

A subnet short subnetwork identifiably separate part organization network
Typically subnet may represent machine one geographic location one building local area network LAN
Having organization network divided subnets allows connected Internet single shared network address
Without subnets organization could get multiple connection Internet one physically separate subnetworks would require unnecessary use limited number network number Internet assign
It would also require Internet routing table gateway outside organization would need know manage routing could handled within organization

The Internet collection network whose user communicate
Each communication carry address source destination network particular machine within network associated user host computer end
This address called Internet Protocol address
This IP address two part one part identifies network part identifies specific machine host within network
An organization use bit machine host part address identify specific subnet
Effectively IP address contains three part network number subnet number machine number
The standard procedure creating identifying subnets provided Internet
The IP address often depicted also called four group decimal number separated period
Here example Each decimal number represents string eight binary digit
Thus IP address really string As see inserted period sequence decimal version IP address
Obviously decimal version IP address easier read form commonly used
Some portion IP address represents network number address portion represents local machine address also known address
IP address one several class determining many bit represent network number many represent host number
The common class used large organization Class B allows bit network number host number
Using example IP address divided If wanted add subnetting address portion example eight bit host address could used subnet address
Thus To simplify explanation divided subnet neat eight bit organization could choose scheme using part third quad even part fourth quad
Once packet arrived organization connection point unique network number routed within organization internal gateway using subnet number
The router know bit look look looking screen number tell number look underneath
In binary mask number say Look number underneath say Do look
Using mask save router handle entire bit address simply look bit selected mask

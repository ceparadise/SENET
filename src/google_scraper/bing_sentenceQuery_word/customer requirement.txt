There several option available completing senior project requirement
The senior project class common way
In class student work team build significant programming application learning practicing useful strategy software design engineering
At end class student demo project front student course staff representative many local company
fulfills WIM requirement
A second popular way fulfill senior project requirement take
This sequence student work loosely defined challenge defined corporate partner R D lab
Each team function small startup company dedicated space discretionary budget technical advisory board comprised instructional staff
The sequence affords time experiment benchmark try different idea zeroing particular direction
The time frame also mean provides enough time build something lasting impact
This class also great opportunity develop relationship company learn skill helpful managing team starting company
Another option senior project undertake individual research faculty member auspex
writing intensive version involves several writing assignment fulfills WIM requirement
Doing research based senior project provide additional valuable experience student interested research career
Taking requires finding faculty member oversee project
See information
Students taking must also fill senior project proposal form get approvoal advisor Patrick Young
Another option fulfill senior project requirement senior honor thesis
Writing honor thesis includes research project supervised CS faculty member
Applications honor program due May
For information see
A final option senior project directed research class
If like take part active research specific project mind would like guidance might
The class typically focused single large project professor interest
People choose assigned part larger project work quarter
For example past student contributed DARPA Grand Challenge robot
The topic change year though frequently led AI professor
Professors may expect student comfortable technique used field
For example AI might expect taken
Like student opt version fulfills WIM requirement
Almost everyone fulfills WIM requirement senior project
If took TIS requirement need fulfill WIM senior project
WIM requirement fulfilled class also fulfills another requirement

A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

Conceptually requirement analysis includes three type activity Requirements analysis long tiring process many delicate psychological skill involved
Large system may confront analyst hundred thousand system requirement
New system change environment relationship people important identify stakeholder take account need ensure understand implication new system
Analysts employ several technique elicit requirement customer
These may include development scenario represented identification use workplace observation holding aptly named context requirement workshop requirement review session creating requirement list
may used develop example system demonstrated stakeholder
Where necessary analyst employ combination method establish exact requirement stakeholder system meet business need produced
Requirements quality improved method See discussion people organization legal entity company standard body valid interest system
They may affected either directly indirectly
A major new emphasis focus identification
It increasingly recognized stakeholder limited organization employing analyst
Other stakeholder include Requirements often implication unknown individual stakeholder often missed incompletely defined stakeholder interview
These implication elicited conducting JRD session controlled environment facilitated trained Business Analyst wherein stakeholder participate discussion elicit requirement analyze detail uncover implication
A dedicated scribe present document discussion freeing Business Analyst lead discussion direction generates appropriate requirement meet session objective
JRD Sessions analogous Sessions
In former session elicit requirement guide design whereas latter elicit specific design feature implemented satisfaction elicited requirement
One traditional way documenting requirement contract style requirement list
In complex system requirement list run hundred page long
An appropriate metaphor would extremely long shopping list
Such list much favour modern analysis proved spectacularly unsuccessful achieving aim still seen day
As alternative requirement list us suggest requirement everyday language
Best practice take composed list requirement merely clue repeatedly ask
actual business purpose discovered
Stakeholders developer devise test measure level goal achieved thus far
Such goal change slowly long list specific unmeasured requirement
Once small set critical measured goal established short iterative development phase may proceed deliver actual stakeholder value long project half

Early view application led fewer change later hence reduced overall cost considerably
Prototypes flat diagram often referred working application using synthesized functionality
Wireframes made variety graphic design document often remove color design

This help prevent confusion whether prototype represents final visual look feel application

Each use case provides set convey system interact human user another system achieve specific business goal
Use case typically avoid technical jargon preferring instead language
Use case often requirement engineer stakeholder
Use case deceptively simple tool describing behavior software system

area concerned designing controlling process redesigning production
It involves responsibility ensuring operation term using resource needed term meeting customer requirement
It concerned managing entire production system process convert input form output form good service asset delivers product service
Operations produce product manage quality creates service
Operation management cover sector like banking system hospital company working supplier customer using technology
Operations one major function organization along supply chain marketing finance human resource
The operation function requires management strategic production good service
In managing manufacturing service operation several type decision made including operation strategy product design process design quality management capacity facility planning production planning inventory control
Each requires ability analyze current situation find better solution improve effectiveness efficiency manufacturing service operation
The history production operation system began around
priest developed ancient system recording inventory loan tax business transaction
The next major historical application operation system occurred
It time started using large construction pyramid
By labor specialized described advantage dividing various operation necessary production shoe among different individual In large city hand inasmuch many people demand make upon branch industry one trade alone often even le whole trade enough support man one man instance make shoe men another woman place even one man earns living stitching shoe another cutting another sewing upper together another performs none operation assembles part
It follows therefore matter course devotes highly specialized line work bound best possible manner
In king queen ruled large area land
Loyal nobleman maintained large section monarch territory
This hierarchical organization people divided class based social position wealth became known
In feudal system produced people higher class using ruler land resource
Although large part labor employed agriculture contributed economic output formed
The guild system operating mainly consisted two type merchant guild bought sold good craft guild made good
Although guild regulated quality work performed resulting system rather rigid example prohibited tanning hide
Services also performed Middle Ages servant
They provided service nobility cooking cleaning entertainment
Court jester service provider
The medieval army could also considered service since defended nobility
The facilitated two element interchangeability part division labor
always feature beginning extent division carried varied considerably depending period location
Compared Middle Ages characterized greater specialization labor one characteristic growing European city trade
It late eighteenth century popularized concept manufactured musket
Up point history manufacturing product
gun considered special order meaning part given gun fitted particular gun could used gun
Interchangeability part allowed mass production part independent final product would used
In introduced method accurately measuring time perform single task complicated job
He developed scientific study productivity identifying coordinate different task eliminate wasting time increase quality work
The next generation scientific study occurred development PMTS
Work sampling used measure random variable associated time task
PMTS allows use standard predetermined table smallest body movement
turning left wrist integrating predict time needed perform simple task
PMTS gained substantial importance due fact predict work measurement without observing actual work
The foundation PMTS laid research development around
The Gilbreths took advantage taking motion picture known time interval operator performing given task
Service Industries At turn twentieth century service industry already developed largely fragmented
In service industry consisted bank professional service school general store railroad telegraph
Services largely local nature except railroad telegraph owned entrepreneur family
The employment service manufacturing agriculture
The idea used multiple time history prior Henry Ford Smith pin manufacturing Brunel
first manufacture car using assembly line system developed first auto assembly system car chassis moved assembly line worker added component car completed
During World War II growth computing power led development efficient manufacturing method use advanced mathematical statistical tool
This supported development academic program discipline well field operation research management science field problem solving
While concentrated broad characteristic relationship input output generic system operation researcher concentrated solving specific focused problem
The synergy system engineering allowed realization solving large scale complex problem modern era
Recently development faster smaller computer opened new opportunity operation manufacturing production service system
Before work mainly done two system
In domestic system took material home artisan performed necessary work craft guild hand association passed work one shop another example leather tanned passed finally arrived
The beginning industrial revolution usually associated century English invention
In term used describe new approach evolving based two central feature extensive use produce
Henry Ford year old founded capital twelve investor
The car introduced however Ford implemented assembly line concept vision making popular car affordable every American citizen would realized
The first factory used concept characterized system follows The thing keep everything motion take work man man work
That real principle production one many mean end This became one central idea led one main element along emergence
The economy noted Daniel Bell
He stated future economy would provide GDP employment service manufacturing great effect society
Since sector highly interconnected reflect le importance manufacturing agriculture mining shift type economic activity
Although productivity benefited considerably technological invention division labor problem systematic measurement performance calculation use formula remained somewhat unexplored Frederick Taylor whose early work focused developing called differential system series experiment measurement formula dealing manual labor
The differential consisted offering two different pay rate job higher rate worker high productivity efficiency produced high quality good effectiveness lower rate fail achieve standard
One problem Taylor believed could solved system problem faster worker reducing production rate slowest worker
In Taylor published The Principles Scientific Management characterized also known Taylor also credited developing stopwatch time study combined Gilbreth motion study gave way centered concept standard method
Frank Gilbreth also responsible introducing
Other contemporary Taylor worth remembering rural electrification implementer Taylor principle scientific management Philadelphia Department Public Works slide rule Gantt chart
Also published first book Factory Organization Administration
In published How many part make presented idea model
He described problem follows capital tied material set maximum limit quantity part profitably manufactured one time job fix minimum
Experience shown one manager way determine economical size lot This paper inspired large body mathematical literature focusing problem
In introduced technical memorandum working central method distinction variation
In Shewhart published Economic Control Quality Manufactured Product first systematic treatment subject SPC
In MTM developed
Maynard JL Schwab GJ Stegemerten
MTM first series predetermined sense estimate time determined loco derived industry standard
This explained originator book published called Measurement
Up point history technique known long time simple method employed elaborate technique developed employed slowly developed first moving eletromechanical computer
During however development went major boost development first electronic digital computer programmable possibility computationally solve large problem first working latter
These method known today belonging field
From point curious development took place United States possibility applying computer business operation led development management software architecture successive modification ever sophisticated optimization technique software Japan series event Toyota Motor led development TPS
In Japan arrived company
Toyota evolved unique manufacturing system centered two complementary notion produce needed automation human touch
Regarding JIT Ohno inspired American workstation functioned like supermarket shelf customer get product need time need amount needed workstation shelf restocked
Autonomation developed Toyoda Spinning Weaving automatically activated loom also foolproof automatically detected problem
In Edwards published MRP style described JIT goal term seven zero zero defect zero excess lot size zero setup zero breakdown zero handling zero lead time zero surging
This period also mark spread TQM Japan idea initially developed American author
TQM strategy implementing managing quality improvement organizational basis includes participation work culture customer focus supplier quality improvement integration quality system business goal
Schnonberger identified seven fundamental principle essential Japanese approach Meanwhile sixty different approach developed George Plossl Oliver Wight approach continued Joseph Orlicky response TOYOTA Manufacturing Program led MRP latter gaining momentum American Production Inventory Control Society launched MRP Crusade
One key insight management system distinction
Independent demand demand originates outside production system therefore directly controllable dependent demand demand component final product therefore subject directly controllable management via
Orlicky wrote Materials Requirement Planning first hard cover book subject
developed Gene Thomas IBM expanded original MRP software include additional production function
ERP modern software architecture address besides production operation
Dramatic change occurring service industry well
Beginning provided one first innovation service operation
McDonald founded idea approach service
This requires standard limited menu type production process high customer service cleanliness courtesy fast service
While modeled manufacturing production food service defined oriented customer
It McDonald operation system production service made difference
McDonald also pioneered idea franchising operation system rapidly spread business around country later world
provided first overnight delivery package
This based innovative idea flying package single airport Memphis Tenn midnight day resorting package delivery destination flying back next morning delivery numerous location
This concept fast package delivery system created whole new industry eventually allowed fast delivery online order Amazon retailer
provided first example low cost retailing design store efficient management entire supply chain
Starting single store Roger Arkansas Walmart become world largest company
This accomplished adhering system delivering good service customer lowest possible cost
The operation system included careful selection merchandise low cost sourcing ownership transportation efficient location store friendly service customer
In ISO recognizing growing importance quality issued family standard related quality management system
There standard apply manufacturing service organization
There controversy regarding proper procedure follow amount paperwork involved much improved current ISO revision
With coming Internet devised service system retailing distribution
With innovative system customer able search product might like buy enter order product pay online track delivery product location two day
This required large computer operation dispersed warehouse efficient transportation system
Service customer including high merchandise assortment return service purchase fast delivery forefront business
It customer system production delivery service distinguishes service manufacturing
Recent trend field revolve around concept A production system comprises technological element machine tool organizational behavior division labor information flow
An individual production system usually analyzed literature referring single business therefore usually improper include given production system operation necessary process good obtained operation carried sold product reason simply since business need design production system becomes focus analysis modeling decision making also called configuring production system
A first possible distinction production system technological classification continuous process production discrete part production
Another possible classification one based manufacturing lead time v delivery lead time ETO PTO MTO ATO MTS
According classification different kind system different customer order decoupling point CODP meaning WIP cycle stock level practically nonexistent regarding operation located CODP except due queue
See The concept production system expanded world keeping mind service fundamental difference respect material good intangibility client always present transformation process stock finished good
Services classified according service process matrix degree labor intensity volume v degree customization variety
With high degree labor intensity Mass Services bill payment Professional Services personal low degree labor intensity Service Factories Service Shops
The system described real system may present hybrid category
Consider example production involves initially cutting fabric different shape assembling part pant jacket combining fabric thread zipper button finally shipped store
The beginning seen process production middle part production end process production unlikely single company keep stage production single roof therefore problem arises
Most product require process production part production
Operations strategy concern policy plan use firm productive resource aim supporting long term competitive strategy
Metrics operation management broadly classified metric metric
Effectiveness metric involve A recent approach introduced Terry Hill involves distinguishing competitive variable order winner order qualifier defining operation strategy
Order winner variable permit differentiating company competitor order qualifier prerequisite engaging transaction
This view seen unifying approach operation management see
standard efficiency metric evaluation production system broadly speaking ratio output input assume many specific form example machine productivity workforce productivity raw material productivity warehouse productivity
It also useful break productivity use U productive percentage total time yield η ratio produced volume productive time better evaluate production system performance
Cycle time modeled engineering individual operation heavily automated manual component prevalent one method used include
method analyzing inventory based posit since revenue item inventory distributed make sense manage item differently based position level matrix class constructed A B C cumulative item revenue matrix item letter A B C assigned revenue inventory
This method posit item away diagonal managed differently item upper part subject risk obsolescence item lower part subject risk
variable quantifies number part produced unit time
Although estimating throughput single process maybe fairly simple entire production system involves additional difficulty due presence queue come machine processing time variability scrap setup time lack order lack material bad coordination resource mix variability plus inefficiency tend compound depending nature production system
One important example system throughput tied system design job shop bottleneck typically dynamic dependent scheduling transfer line make sense speak bottleneck since univocally associated specific station line
This lead problem define measure estimation maximum output given production system
OEE defined product system availability cycle time efficiency quality rate
OEE typically used key performance indicator KPI conjunction lean manufacturing approach
Designing involves variable
Choices production technology involve dimensioning fractioning capacity capacity location process process technology operation volume variety see
Choices organizational area involve defining worker team coordination worker incentive information flow
Regarding basic distinction approach approach later including singular approach
Pull mean production system authorizes production based inventory level push mean production occurs based demand forecasted present
An individual production system push pull example activity CODP may work pull system activity CODP may work push system
Regarding traditional pull approach number technique developed based work Ford Harris came known EOQ model
This model mark beginning includes model
These model usually involve calculation latter usually modeled function demand variability
The economic production quantity EPQ differs EOQ model assumes constant fill rate part produced instead instantaneous refilling EOQ model
others IBM developed approach inventory control production planning known MRP take input MPS BOM give output schedule material component needed production process
MRP therefore planning tool manage production order also called job
The MPS seen kind aggregate planning production coming two fundamentally opposing variety plan try demand plan try keep uniform capacity utilization
Many model proposed solve MPS problem MRP briefly described procedure sum different order split lot shift time according item lead time
To avoid explosion data processing MRP number BOMs required input family bill super bill useful since allow rationalization input data common code
MRP notorious problem infinite fixed influenced successive modification original software architecture form ERP APS
In context problem loading tool use part type selection part work application significant role play
approach production arose end World War II seventy
It come mainly idea centered complementary notion jidoka aimed reducing waste usually applied style
Some additional element also fundamental production smoothing Heijunka capacity buffer setup reduction plant layout
A series tool developed mainly objective replicating Toyota success common implementation involves small card known also come variety reorder kanbans alarm kanbans triangular kanbans etc
In classic kanban procedure one card The kanban procedure differs bit Since number kanbans production system set manager constant number kanban procedure work controlling device given arrival rate per work lead time controlling device
In Toyota TPS represented philosophy production set specific lean tool latter would include Seen broadly JIT include method product standardization JIT production sensitive replenishment condition
In heavily production system production planning information gathering may executed via attention paid however avoid problem lead productivity loss
applies concept operation management execution delivery capital project viewing sequence activity project production system
Operations management principle variability reduction management applied buffering combination capacity time inventory
major part economic activity employment industrialized country comprising percent employment GDP Operations management service distinct manufacturing developing since publication unique practice academic research
Please note section particularly include Professional Services Firms professional service practiced expertise specialized training education within
According Fitzsimmons Fitzsimmons Bordoloi difference manufactured good service follows These four comparison indicate management service operation quite different manufacturing regarding issue capacity requirement highly variable quality assurance hard quantify location facility dispersed interaction customer delivery service product process design
While difference also many similarity
For example quality management approach used manufacturing Baldrige Award Six Sigma widely applied service
Likewise principle practice also applied service operation
The important difference customer system service provided need considered applying practice
One important difference service recovery
When error occurs service delivery recovery must delivered spot service provider
If waiter restaurant spill soup customer lap recovery could include free meal promise free dry cleaning
Another difference planning capacity
Since product stored service facility must managed peak demand requires flexibility manufacturing
Location facility must near customer scale economics lacking
Scheduling must consider customer waiting line
Queuing theory devised assist design service facility waiting line
Revenue management important service operation since empty seat airplane lost revenue plane departs stored future use
There also field mathematical theory found application field operation management mainly problem
Queue theory employed modelling queue processing time production system mathematical optimization draw heavily
Queue theory based
It also worth noticing computation usually based modeling demand MRP inventory problem formulated using
When analytical model enough manager may resort using
Simulation traditionally done thought paradigm simulation model posse state change discrete event happens consists clock list event
The recent paradigm consists set resource set transaction transaction move network resource node according code called process
Since real production process always affected disturbance input output many company implement form
The designation provides summary commonly used tool These used approach like
Keeping quality control relevant increasing customer satisfaction reducing processing waste
Operations management usually cover even though strictly speaking operation problem demand related production system variable
For example classic approach dimensioning requires calculating
Demand forecasting also critical part push system since order release planned ahead actual client order
Also serious discussion involves adjusting company output market demand
Other important problem involve policy see also see also supply chain integration

The system life cycle broken five stage Analysis Design Implementation Operation Maintenance
Gathering data essential analysis stage gain clear insight problem
If problem identified correctly poor solution guaranteed follow
A requirement specification contains system able done
This include A feasibility report produced analysis design stage
It include There number different way problem solved without using computer
One consideration must take account input output solution
The software could one three type Systems usually go several stage testing
Alpha testing first stage asmall group qualified individual examine early version program
Beta testing program fully featured released wider audience testing
Test data also used make sure program output expected data
We test program A new system implemented one following three way Proper maintenance system essential clear documentation begin help progress programmer need work hard understand design decision explained documentation
This reduces cost maintanence
Periodic review performance review use data collection technique seen analysis section indicate whether improvement modification needed

The main objective chapter gain knowledge working information system role System Development Life Cycle SDLC
It integrate various aspect input output Information System SDLC
An information system combination five element like human data software hardware network
All five element organized together convert given input output processing data information
The system resource used processing information hardware software
Hardware refers equipment used transforming information equipment resource software refers collection program material resource
According Silver et al
Information Systems defined system implemented within organization purpose improving effectiveness efficiency organization
Capabilities information system characteristic organization work system people development implementation methodology together determine extent purpose To become skilled user information know organisation achieving aim objective one clear following factor information
Information collected various source like internal source external source primary source secondary source etc
The information also classified based usage organization different level like strategic information tactical information operational information etc
Quality information refers reliability fitness use
Attributes affect quality timeline accuracy adequacy relevance completeness explicitness exception base etc
Information system play significant role various perspective real world like end user perspective organization perspective global society perspective
As section various factor information elaborated next element information system follows Consist information specialist end user
Deals transforming data information
Includes procedure program information management
Are equipment machine used data processing
Include communication medium support

Short ILM creation management storage infrastructure data maintains
All information data storage network specific lifecycle time information enters organization system time archived removed system
The information may finite lifecycle data eventually removed storage information becomes outdated longer infinite lifecycle information remains valuable organization retaining
In general three stage information lifecycle The management information lifecycle involves keeping data accessible user need information determining information stored based high priority information organization given moment
At stage information lifecycle management infrastructure must determine best storage medium required information stage factor differ data move lifecycle

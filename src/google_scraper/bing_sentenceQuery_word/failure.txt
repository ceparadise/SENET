Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

Still question
Ask

In group scientist spoke danger nuclear weapon
Should cryptographer take surveillance state
Computer scientist cryptographer occupy ivory tower highest floor
Among academic work prestigious celebrated
To average observer much technical comprehend
The field problem sometimes seem remote reality
But computer science quite bit reality
Its practitioner devise surveillance system watch nearly every space public design tool allow privacy digital realm
Computer science political nature
That least according Phillip Rogaway professor computer science University California Davis helped create important tool secure Internet today
Last week Rogaway directly roomful cryptographer conference Auckland New Zealand
He accused moral failure By allowing government construct massive surveillance apparatus field abused public trust
Rogaway said scientist duty pursue social good work
He likened danger posed modern government growing surveillance capability threat nuclear warfare called upon scientist step speak today
I spoke Rogaway cryptographer fail see work moral term emerging link encryption terrorism national conversation
A transcript conversation appears lightly edited concision clarity
Why think computer science many considered apolitical long
I think science technology inherently political whether want think way nature beast
Our training scientist engineer tends deemphasize social positioning u scientist give whole lot thought work impact society
But obviously
It something easily taught either
I taught ethic technology course several year student predisposed get message thing technological also political
We tend analyze working perspective
We focus impact u impact small group company dealing broader social influence usually horizon
What led understand political implication work
I thinking increasingly term Snowden revelation came
Those revelation made confront directly failing community done anything effectual stemming transition Internet amazing tool surveilling entire population
In paper compare debate nuclear science current debate cryptography
Nuclear weapon one obvious threat humanity think surveillance present similar type danger
I
It different nature obviously
The threat indirect subtle
So nuclear warfare visually compelling frightening risk going mushroom cloud
And transition state total surveillance slow forfeiture democracy
Who else wider class nuclear scientist besides computer level political responsibility
I think hold scientist engineer
Very u something esoteric unlikely end connected social
If going exclude people maybe pure mathematician example
But live age technology scientist technologist reshapes character world
Are historical example scientist acting according moral principle rather pursuing pure academic inquiry
I allude couple others paper
Rachel Carson scientist environmental activist nice example
There activist scientist popular breed exist
The Indian Shiva seed one prominent frankly
There tradition especially physic activism
But computer scientist tended active political sphere
I think Star Wars computer scientist questioning viability building kind system Reagan envisioning saying really far beyond capability contemporary computer science
So certainly unheard scientist playing role
What physicist make particularly likely involved sort thing
I think legacy experience Manhattan Project
I think way live continuation history something internalized among many physicist
And I give example university physicist group outside humanity call chancellor resignation aftermath
Somehow surprising
My colleague physic department say kind question routinely discussed I think true engineering department general
Is inherent danger politicizing academic discipline
I think lot people drawn fact academia allows inquiry
Is anything go wrong politics come
My sense politics whether one acknowledges
When ostensibly apolitical department scratch beneath cover discover faculty funded Department Defense well fact apolitical
That much working support particular ethos one simply called forth
Does tenure role play
Does tenure help academic focus socially important goal divorce reality
In principle tenure process free academic already tenured venture question matter way could offend power
In practice seem relevant
By time faculty member tenured likely way seeing world already set unlikely become political point already
You criticized typical framing FBI director James Comey like call Explaining risk strong encryption testified week front Senate Judiciary Committee saying encryption part terrorist tradecraft What think sort framing
In talk I gave week I described two utterly different framing surveillance framing framing
James Comey come repeatedly sort talking point framing
I believe ultimately stand close scrutiny
It involves whole bunch related belief starting fact privacy security opposition one another bad guy technology boon encryption disposal
We run risk going That phrase James Comey us
A world dark locked closet
I think entire framing sort discourse fear make people believe need almost father figure protect u going give civil liberty somehow social good
I think ultimately make sense starting beginning privacy security routinely opposition one another going presumed effectiveness denying population access effective privacy tool somehow help fight terrorism
I think terrorism much issue
This convenient storyline weaving present day NSA mission statement say serve customer
And customer interested terrorism NSA customer completely unrelated interest I think surveilling particularly aimed confronting terrorism
It effective even
Anyone really want encrypt communication going find method whether bundled product
When make encryption harder get ordinary people deny terrorist
You make population whole insecure daily communication
Furthermore law enforcement extraordinary set tool available
An unprecedented set capability law enforcement intelligence service
These somehow dark time either law enforcement intelligence
These time extraordinary information
Nowhere history easy learn much everybody
So sense really talking protecting smallest remnant remaining privacy
There question terrorist using technology benefit
Should computer scientist anything
Criminals always going use technology benefit ordinary people going attempt
I believe anyone going change basic truth
Fortunately criminal behavior never drag society foreclosed entire area technological advance
You touch recommendation academic looking involved get people role blocking mass surveillance
Should morality criterion hiring
I think hiring faculty member public university fair game ask social view view social responsibility scientist
I think careful applying kind political test candidate political opinion match
But part purpose public university university like serve public welfare
And faculty candidate believe part purpose work I think appropriate
But I think one quite careful applied become sort political test
There wide range ideology perfectly consistent scientist faculty member
But one kind ideology consistent say What I impact I Because true
What issue funding
The fact much money work academic come part government involved way around
Faculty member decide funding seek
But rare faculty member say I going accept DoD funding example
I think viewpoint common actually
That people say I accept agency I agree institutional Is practical proposition
It perfectly practical sense successful faculty member without accepting DoD funding
You many student able support large research group
And area computer science I sure area broadly vast majority funding may DoD
I remember speaking computer architect asking person computer architecture aware take DoD money said
And really believe person could exist successful field access adequate resource National Science Foundation say
In area cryptography I think one fine living NSF money
But group student something
The paper talk gave pretty critical colleague field
How taken criticism since presented paper
I received great deal feedback almost positive
Even faculty member whose research kind directly impinged
So I believe thought expressed piece exist kind undercurrent lot people thinking
It uncommon give voice
I received great many positive email thanks essentially negative one
Maybe people talking I know
What think moral role journalism medium covering issue
First I think journalism quite threatened possibility continually surveilled
It surprising journalist fighting harder ensure good easy access tool privacy
Perhaps indication decline investigative journalism number people really investigative journalism journalist arm revelation example many journalist surveilled probably beyond technical capability potential source actually avert modern surveillance
And world journalist denied access source speak free fear governmental intrusion I think shuts enormously important aspect make democracy work
I think healthy democracy without healthy journalism I think healthy journalism without ability conduct private conversation
And includes saying saying
If every contact journalist weight contact number minute frequency something hundred thousand analyst get search tool I think make serious investigative journalism effectively impossible

Businesses ask graduate UK enter job market without required technology skill US manages produce IT worker industry
By Our education system UK created year ago service empire economy business economy
David Richards CEO WANdisco voicing frustration computer science student graduate UK university skill need business
We still bright intelligent people accept take graduate pretty much train said
Distributed computing specialist WANdisco employ range software engineer developer particularly Java programmer work Hadoop framework
In contrast WANdisco experience recruiting role US far positive
In US education system better Richards said
We take graduate university immediately productive core Hadoop development
Not specific stuff need around edge well
They come right conveyor belt
For example guy whose first job university looking main Hadoop cluster eBay
We talking kid
Questions long asked UK computer science graduate likely university leaver unemployed particularly company perennially complain shortage IT skill
Some industry figure suggested UK offshored many role would given graduate start career ladder
Richards belief driving unemployment require closer link university employer UK similar exists US
It responsibility educational establishment turn graduate skill
It shortage job
There reason Silicon Valley exists really university system
The university close employer
Lecturers Stanford go create company
Alongside attempt create tech hub London Silicon Roundabout Richards said effort focused building enterprise park around UK research centre
The cluster really occur around research educational institution around roundabout
Richards alone IT industry voicing concern lack appropriate skill among job applicant
Last year Eben Upton one Raspberry Pi Linux board said
In day job Upton architect processor designer Broadcom
It industry lot niche I look around Broadcom enough guy

It dying industry yet carry probably fall critical mass wo sustainable anymore said
Dr Iain Phillips former chairman Council Professors Heads Computing senior lecturer computer science Loughborough University
He said university working business try closely align teaching industry requirement
There number university trying something
We engage organisation National Centre Universities Business individual university industrial liaison committee try make degree
We clear definition think computer science try get informed liaison industry
In attempt bridge skill gap Sector Skills Council created degree programme called Technology Management Business curriculum based feedback industry
But Phillips belief also important university provide grounding skill required business today
There lot computer science research going university could well influence industry industry would realise gone research process
There life university simply training student industry purpose university advance subject well
Chances issue always concern industry thing moving fast
Using example Hadoop going back five year ago WANdisco David Richards would wanted Hadoop operator sort thing exist level
Who know going next thing five year time
The change quite rapid

Yet understand programming language one must implement one
Ideally every computer science major would take compiler class
At minimum every computer science major implement interpreter
The following language provide reasonable mixture paradigm practical application Racket dialect Lisp aggressively simple syntax

Computer scientist understand generative programming macro lexical dynamic scope closure continuation function dynamic dispatch subtyping module functors monad semantic concept distinct specific syntax
Computer scientist must solid grasp formal logic proof
Proof algebraic manipulation natural deduction engages reasoning common routine programming task
Proof induction engages reasoning used construction recursive function
Computer scientist must fluent formal mathematical notation reasoning rigorously basic discrete structure set tuples sequence function power set
For computer scientist important cover reasoning Students learn enough number theory study implement common cryptographic protocol
Students certainly see common rare yet unreasonably effective data structure algorithm
But important knowing specific algorithm data structure usually easy enough look computer scientist must understand design algorithm greedy dynamic strategy span gap algorithm ideal implementation
At minimum computer scientist seeking stable employment know following Computer scientist ready implement extend algorithm operates data structure including ability search element add element remove element
For completeness computer scientist know imperative functional version algorithm
A grasp theory prerequisite research graduate school
Theory invaluable provides hard boundary problem provides mean circumventing initially appear hard boundary
Computational complexity legitimately claim one truly predictive theory computer science
A computer scientist know boundary tractability computability lie
To ignore limit invite frustration best case failure worst
At undergraduate level theory cover least model computation computational complexity
Models computation cover automaton regular language regular expression pushdown automaton language formal grammar Turing machine lambda calculus undecidability
At undergraduate level student learn least enough complexity understand difference P NP
To avoid leaving wrong impression student solve large problem NP reduction SAT use modern SAT solver
There substitute solid understanding computer architecture
Computer scientist understand computer transistor
The understanding architecture encompass standard level abstraction transistor gate adder muxes flip flop ALUs control unit cache RAM
An understanding GPU model computing important foreseeable future
A good understanding cache bus hardware memory management essential achieving good performance modern system
To get good grasp machine architecture student design simulate small CPU
Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes operating system
As computer scientist aware kernel handle system call paging scheduling filesystems internal resource management
A good understanding operating system secondary understanding compiler architecture achieving performance
Understanding operating system I would interpret liberally include runtime system becomes especially important programming embedded system without one
It important student get hand dirty real operating system
With Linux virtualization easier ever
To get better understanding kernel student could Given ubiquity network computer scientist firm understanding network stack routing protocol within network
The mechanic building efficient reliable transmission protocol like TCP top unreliable transmission protocol like IP magic computer scientist
It core knowledge
Computer scientist must understand involved protocol design example choose TCP choose UDP
Programmers need understand larger social implication congestion use UDP large scale well
Given frequency modern programmer encounter network programming helpful know protocol existing standard Computer scientist understand exponential back packet collision resolution mechanism involved congestion control
Every computer scientist implement following No student ever pas intro neworking class without sniffing instructor Google query
It probably going far require student implement reliable transmission protocol scratch atop IP I say personally transformative experience student
The sad truth security majority security vulnerability come sloppy programming
The sadder truth many school poor job training programmer secure code
Computer scientist must aware mean program compromised
They need develop sense defensive programming mind thinking code might attacked
Security kind training best distributed throughout entire curriculum discipline warn student native vulnerability
At minimum every computer scientist need understand A reader pointed computer scientist also need aware basic IT security measure choose legitimately good password properly configure firewall iptables
Cryptography make much digital life possible
Computer scientist understand able implement following concept well common pitfall Since common fault implementation cryptosystems every computer scientist know acquire random number task hand
At least nearly every data breach shown computer scientist need know salt hash password storage
Every computer scientist pleasure breaking ciphertext using cryptosystems statistical tool
RSA everyone
Every student create digital certificate set http apache
It surprisingly arduous
Student also write console web client connects SSL
As strictly practical matter computer scientist know use GPG use authentication ssh encrypt directory hard disk
Software testing must distributed throughout entire curriculum
A course software engineering cover basic style testing substitute practicing art
Students graded test case turn
I use test case turned student student
Students seem care much developing defensive test case unleash hell come sandbagging classmate
Programmers often write software programmer worse
User interface design broadly user experience design might underappreciated aspect computer science
There misconception even among professor user experience soft skill ca taught
In reality modern user experience design anchored principle human factor engineering industrial design
If nothing else computer scientist know interface need make ease executing task proportional frequency task multiplied importance
As practicality every programmer comfortable designing usable web interface HTML CSS JavaScript
Good visualization rendering data fashion human perceive information

cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data

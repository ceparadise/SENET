A dimension provided information
Reference dimension provided variety reason often accumulation dimension defined elsewhere
drawing related documentation
These dimension may also used convenience identify single dimension specified elsewhere
different drawing sheet
Reference dimension intended used directly define geometry object
Reference dimension normally govern manufacturing operation machining way therefore typically include dimensional tolerance though tolerance may provided information deemed helpful
Consequently reference dimension also subject dimensional inspection normal circumstance
Prior use modern Design software reference dimension traditionally indicated drawing abbreviation REF written adjacent dimension typically right underneath dimension
However assistance modern abbreviation REF often replaced use parenthesis around dimension
As example distance millimeter might denoted instead
Although method denoting reference dimension accepted still use today increasingly common see use parenthesis instead abbreviation REF primarily due widespread use modern make use parenthesis default denotation method whenever reference dimension automatically created software

Follow u As probably noticed live world defined three spatial dimension one dimension time
In word take three number pinpoint physical location given moment
On coordinate break longitude latitude altitude representing dimension length width height depth
Slap time stamp coordinate pinpointed time well
To strip even world would like single bead measured thread
You slide bead forward slide bead backward need one number figure exact location string length
Where bead
It mark
Now let upgrade world
This essentially flat map like playing field game Battleship chess
You need length width determine location
In Battleship say know location convergence horizontal E line vertical line
Now let add one dimension
Our world factor height depth equation locating submarine exact location Battleship requires two number submarine would demand third coordinate depth
Sure might charging along surface might also hiding foot meter beneath wave
Which
Could fourth spatial dimension
Well tricky question currently ca perceive measure anything beyond dimension length width height
Just three number required pinpoint location world world would require four
At moment likely positioned particular longitude latitude altitude
Walk little left alter longitude latitude
Stand chair exact spot alter altitude
Here get hard Can move current location without altering longitude latitude altitude
You ca fourth spatial dimension u move
But fact ca move fourth spatial dimension perceive one necessarily rule existence
In mathematician Theodor Kaluza theorized fourth spatial dimension might link general relativity electromagnetic theory source
But would go
Theoretical physicist Oskar Klein later revised theory proposing fourth dimension merely curled three spatial dimension extended
In word fourth dimension rolled unseen little like fully retracted tape measure
Furthermore would mean every point world would additional fourth spatial dimension rolled away inside
String theorist however need slightly complicated vision empower superstring theory cosmos
In fact quite easy assume showing bit proposing dimension including time
Wait let blow mind yet
One way envisioning imagine point world contains retracted tape measure geometric shape
One example shape look bit like cross mollusk
Escher drawing Star Trek holiday ornament source
Think way A concrete wall look solid firm distance
Move closer however see dimple hole mark surface
Move even closer see made molecule
Or consider cable From distance appears single thick strand
Get right next find woven countless strand
There always greater complexity meet eye hidden complexity may well conceal tiny dimension
Yet remain certain three spatial dimension one time
If dimension await u beyond limited perception

Spatial geography describes compare distribution variable
For example geographer might study describe physical location fish population relation one another
In addition might compare distribution fish population two different state
Further could study fish population distributed relation variable major road industrial activity water body wildlife topography
By comparing distribution variable geographer determine variable affect one another
For example fish population found abundant road nearby geographer might conclude presence road cause fish population migrate decline
Policy maker might use information maintain fish stock important location
Spatial geography often concerned making distribution variable equitable
For example geographer might study distribute income evenly equalize literacy rate reduce infant mortality rate

When someone mention different dimension tend think thing like parallel universe alternate reality exist parallel thing work happened differently
However reality dimension play role ordering Universe really quite different popular characterization
To break dimension simply different facet perceive reality
We immediately aware three dimension surround u daily basis define length width depth object universe x z ax respectively
Beyond three visible dimension scientist believe may many
In fact theoretical framework Superstring Theory posit universe exists ten different dimension
These different aspect govern universe fundamental force nature elementary particle contained within
The already noted give length aka

A good description object straight line exists term length discernible quality
Add height get object becomes shape like square
The involves depth give object sense area
The perfect example cube exists three dimension length width depth hence volume
Beyond three lie seven dimension immediately apparent u still perceived direct effect universe reality know
Scientists believe time governs property known matter given point
Along three dimension knowing object position time essential plotting position universe
The dimension deeper possibility come play explaining interaction others thing get particularly tricky physicist
According Superstring Theory fifth sixth dimension notion possible world arises
If could see would see world slightly different would give u mean measuring similarity difference world possible one
In would see plane possible world could compare position possible universe start initial condition one
Big Bang
In theory could master fifth sixth dimension could travel back time go different future
In access possible world start different initial condition
Whereas fifth sixth initial condition subsequent action different everything different beginning time
The give u plane possible universe history begin different initial condition branch infinitely hence called infinity
In compare possible universe history starting different possible law physic initial condition
In arrive point everything possible imaginable covered
Beyond nothing imagined u lowly mortal make natural limitation conceive term dimension
The existence additional six dimension perceive necessary String Theory order consistency nature
The fact perceive four dimension space explained one two mechanism either extra dimension compactified small scale else world may live submanifold corresponding brane known particle besides gravity would restricted aka
brane theory
If compactified extra six dimension must form manifold shown
While imperceptible far sens concerned would governed formation universe beginning
Hence scientist believe peering back time using telescope spot light early universe
billion year ago might able see existence additional dimension could influenced evolution cosmos
Much like candidate grand unifying theory aka Theory Everything TOE belief universe made ten dimension depending model string theory use attempt reconcile standard model particle physic existence gravity
In short attempt explain known force within universe interact possible universe might work
For additional information article Universe Today another parallel scientist thought found
There also great resource online
There explains ten dimension detail
You also look PBS web site
It great page ten
You also listen Astronomy Cast
You might find The Large Scale Structure Universe pretty interesting
publishing story regarding work reported Japanese physicist last month Nature News set bit tabloid firestorm describing obscure bit physic theory clearest evidence Austrian scientist trying understand mystery holographic principle How many dimension universe
Several speculative theory physic involve extra dimension beyond four broken three dimension space one time
Some theory suggested A trio Japanese physicist applied reformulation string theory called IIB whereby matrix used describe property physical universe supercomputer effectively show Did early universe one spatial dimension
That concept heart theory University Buffalo physicist Dejan Stojkovic colleague proposed
Researchers University Cambridge taken peek secretive domain quantum mechanic
In theoretical paper published journal Physical Review A shown way particle A novel approach studying viscosity water revealed new insight behavior water molecule may open pathway electronics
Using ultracold atom researcher Heidelberg University found exotic state matter constituent particle pair limited two dimension
The finding field quantum physic may hold At TU Wien recently particle known fermion discovered material strong interaction electron
Just like light particle mass nonetheless move extremely slowly
A group Michigan State University MSU researcher specializing quantum calculation proposed radically new computational approach solving complex Schr√∂dinger equation hold key A research team led scientist Department Energy Ames Laboratory demonstrated first time magnetic field bacterial cell magnetic liquid studied

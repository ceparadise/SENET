involves sharing information ensure consistency redundant resource component improve reliability accessibility
One speaks A computational task typically
executed separate device could executed repeatedly single device
Replication space time often linked scheduling algorithm The access replicated entity typically uniform access single entity
The replication external user
Also failure scenario replica hidden much possible
The latter refers data replication respect aspect
Computer scientist talk active passive replication system replicate data service If time one master replica designated process request talking scheme scheme predominant
On side replica process request distributes new state scheme called database field
In scheme form must used
differs task replication since distributes load different computation across machine allows single computation dropped case failure
Load balancing however sometimes us data replication especially replication internally distribute data among machine
differs replication save copy data unchanged long period time
Replicas hand undergo frequent update quickly lose historical state
Replication one oldest important topic overall area
Whether one replicates data computation objective group process handle incoming event
If replicate data process passive operate maintain stored data reply read request apply update
When replicate computation usual goal provide
For example replicated service might used control telephone switch objective ensuring even primary controller fails backup take function
But underlying need case ensuring replica see event equivalent order stay consistent state hence replica respond query
A number widely cited model exist data replication property performance replication used many usually relationship original copy
The master log update ripple slave
The slave output message stating received update successfully thus allowing sending potentially successfully applied subsequent update
update submitted database node ripple server often desired introduces substantially increased cost complexity may make impractical situation
The common challenge exists replication transactional conflict prevention resolution
Most synchronous eager replication solution conflict prevention asynchronous solution conflict resolution
For instance record changed two node simultaneously eager replication system would detect conflict confirming commit abort one transaction
A system would allow transaction commit run conflict resolution resynchronization
The resolution conflict may based timestamp transaction hierarchy origin node much complex logic decides consistently node
Database replication becomes difficult scale
Usually scale go two dimension horizontal vertical horizontal data replica vertical data replica located away distance
Problems raised horizontal alleviated access protocol
Vertical cause fewer problem internet reliability performance improving
When data replicated database server information remains consistent throughout database system user tell even know server DBMS using system said exhibit replication transparency
Active storage replication usually implemented distributing update several physical
This way supported replicated without modification file system code work level block device driver layer
It implemented either hardware software
The basic method typical locally connected disk
The storage industry narrow definition local operation
A extendable across disk located physically distant location database replication model usually applied
The purpose replication prevent damage failure may occur one location case event occur improve ability recover
For replication latency key factor determines either far apart site type replication employed
The main characteristic replication write operation handled To address limit imposed latency technique applied link
Many use replication ensure fault tolerance avoid single point failure
See list
replication replicating file logical level rather replicating storage block level
There many different way performing
Unlike replication solution almost exclusively rely software
With use specifically intercept call filesystem function activity captured immediately occurs
This utilises type technology real time active virus checker employ
At level logical file operation captured like file open write delete etc
The kernel driver transmits command another process generally network different machine mimic operation source machine
Like storage replication replication allows synchronous asynchronous mode
In synchronous mode write operation source machine held allowed occur destination machine acknowledged successful replication
Synchronous mode le common file replication product although solution exist
File level replication solution yield benefit
Firstly data captured file level make informed decision whether replicate based location file type file
Hence unlike storage replication whole volume need replicated file replication product ability exclude temporary file part filesystem hold business value
This substantially reduce amount data sent source machine well decrease storage burden destination machine
A benefit decreasing bandwidth data transmitted granular replication
If application writes byte byte transmitted complete disk block generally byte
On negative side software solution requires implementation maintenance operating system level us machine processing power CPU
Similarly database many ability activity
The journal sent another machine either periodically real time streaming
On replica side journal used play back file system modification
One notable implementation DPM performs periodical update offer replication
This process comparing source destination filesystems ensuring destination match source
The key benefit solution generally free inexpensive
The downside process synchronizing quite consequently process generally run infrequently
One notable implementation
Another example using replication appears system may happen many node system share page memory usually mean node separate copy replica page
Many classical approach replication based model one device process unilateral control one process device
For example primary might perform computation streaming log update backup standby process take primary fails
This approach common one replicating database despite risk portion log lost failure backup might state identical one primary transaction could lost
A weakness scheme setting process could active one actually performing operation
We gaining spending twice much money get property
For reason starting period around distributed system research community began explore alternative method replicating data
An outgrowth work emergence scheme group replica could cooperate process backup others handling share workload
towering figure within database community analyzed replication scheme transactional model ultimately published widely cited paper skeptical approach
In nutshell argued unless data split natural way database treated disjoint concurrency control conflict result seriously degraded performance group replica probably slow function
Indeed suggests common approach likely result degradation scale
His solution partition data viable situation data actually natural partitioning key
The situation always bleak
For example period model proposed emerged widely adopted standard used Isis Toolkit Horus Transis Ensemble Totem Phoenix Quicksilver system basis CORBA computing standard model also used IBM Websphere replicate business logic Microsoft Windows Server technology
Virtual synchrony permit approach group process cooperate parallelize aspect request processing
The scheme used form data feasible provides linear speedup size group
A number modern product support similar scheme
For example support virtual synchrony model used implement replication scheme would also possible use Quicksilver manner
permit active replication every node network exact copy hence every node network active one time scheme optimized use

Any change system new feature new component system change adheres previous much possible changing internal behaviour
The purpose shield change system human user end interface
Confusingly term refers overall component refer
The term widely used computing marketing substitution term since term bad usually seen something user ca see control term good connotation usually associated hiding anything
The vast majority time term used misleading way refer actual invisibility computing process
Because misleading definition modern computer literature tends prefer use agnostic transparent
The term used particularly often regard invisible either upper lower neighbouring layer
Also temporarily used later around IBM Honeywell programming manual term referred certain technique
An application code transparent clear detail management contained logic solving main problem
It achieved putting code module internal detail making invisible main application
For example transparent introduces access file stored remotely network way uniform previous local access user might even notice using folder hierarchy
The early FTP considerably le transparent requires user learn access file client
Similarly file system allow transparent decompression data enabling user store file medium without special knowledge file system encrypt file transparently
This approach require running compression encryption utility manually
In also considered good practice develop use abstraction layer access application work different database abstraction layer allows part program access database transparently see example
In transparency facilitated use hide actual implementation done different underlying
Transparency mean form hide distributed nature user appearing functioning normal centralized system
There many type transparency Formal definition concept found Open Distributed Processing Reference Model ISO
The degree property achieved may vary widely
Not every system hide everything user
For instance due existence fixed finite always latency accessing resource distant user
If one expects interaction distributed system may noticeable

In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

use predefined programming modular unit object class subclass forth order make programming faster easier maintain
language help manage complexity large program
Objects package data operation operation publicly accessible internal detail data structure hidden
This information hiding made programming easier allowing programmer think part program isolation
In addition object may derived general one inheriting capability
Such object made possible define specialized object without repeating general one
programming began Simula language added information hiding
Another influential language Smalltalk program set object interacted sending message one another
Since one successful language
prototype class variable star called eclipsing binary second brightest star northern constellation Perseus
Its apparent visual magnitude change range period day
Even dimmest remains readily visible modern computer programming language

Alfred Thompson blog teaching computer science level
Alfred high school computer science teacher year
He also taught grade computer specialist
I spent latter part last week Palo Alto California working
There pretty amazing people involved project I learned lot various discussion around computer science curriculum
Since talking absolutely positively much part undergraduate computer science curriculum surprising core concept important part discussion
One statement made This quite true course struck maybe talk enough early enough high school computer science course
It important vocabulary word really talk mean deep level
Sometimes perhaps always
Not sure
I pretty sure I never spent enough time
What mean abstraction
There interesting definition floating around used starter
Making clear student tricky especially introduce
So simple version
I see abstraction using symbol represent real thing
In word model real world using data number mostly also image word manipulate using computer
We generate real wind real building computer see building react different speed wind model effect
Push button screen actually depress model behavior using right abstraction
Abstraction tool acting imaginary object represent real thing
In sense object oriented programming graphical user interface programming simplifies complicates discussion abstraction
On one hand GUI object make easy model real work object specific type
At time student make harder understand model abstraction item visible screen
Personally I find property implemented nicely C Visual Basic help picture abstraction way software object represents physical object model various real world object
Your mileage say may vary course
The fact object property method enables u model real world object
At time making transition physical object number somehow represent object come naturally everyone
It important however make transition
This heart computer science work
I trying work mind involved abstraction earlier consistently first programming course
My gut tell long run would make understanding concept easier
Do particularly good discussion point resource lesson learned teaching abstraction share
Any textbook especially good job
Or perhaps operational definition find work student
Abstraction core concept computer science
On hand bit abstract student
Sort pun intended
Unfortunately I think two concept behind use term abstraction abstraction way ignoring certain aspect real world making possible u make generalization reason abstraction computer programming way representing state machine way manipulate flow data machine
I would agree important different way end compromising clearly distinguish
I believe much difficulty student dealing computer science precisely lack distinction
I put together taught curriculum largely based assumption went across well
Patrick right I think
There lot idea abstraction fit short blog post
I probably need lot thinking present various aspect abstraction
I would love know curriculum put together
Is available somewhere
Code Charles Petzold
Read first chapter using Look Inside Amazon convince aptly book layman junior undergrad
Acutally riddle pun
My daughter constantly remind much information I take granted
I found letting physically hold object discus abstraction technique go long way towards understanding EVEN really relate
I think mind allowed iterate method faster physical feedback loop
For example one day I realized know click double click start button first using laptop pc
I took away pc talked electrical signal BS EE grabbed one toy button talked
They lesson last long repeated daily came back pc much background info made moving forward easier
There two way introduce concept abstraction early people get one use animal kingdom Creature Mammal Simian Human Woman example everything Woman abstraction
use food Food Carbohydrate Processed Carbohydrate Bread food example harder plenty different hierarchy impose involves lot replication lower branch unless use fortunately animal kingdom already really well organized abstract class Victorians
You use microcosm start Person Fruit simpler

An object Java basic building block Java application represents object might find around apple cat car human
The two characteristic object always
Consider person object
Its state might include hair color sex height weight also feeling anger frustration love
Its behavior could include walking sleeping cooking working anything else person might
Objects form core programming language
Hundreds book written describe intricacy basically OOP based holistic approach emphasizing inheritance streamlines development time
More traditional procedural language Fortran COBOL C take approach breaking task problem logical orderly series function
For example consider simple ATM application used bank
Before writing code developer first create roadmap plan proceed usually beginning list object need created interact
Developers may use class diagram clarify relationship object
Objects required use ATM transaction might Money Card Balance Receipt Withdrawal Deposit
These object need work together complete transaction making deposit result balance report perhaps receipt instance
Objects pas message order get thing done
An object instance class crux programming idea
Before object exist class based must exist
Perhaps want book object precise want book
We first need create class Book
This class could basis book world
It might look something like The class Book title author method allow set get either item would element well example excerpt
But yet object Java application ca yet anything
It need instantiated become object used
The relationship object class many object created using one class
Each object data underlying structure type data store behavior defined class
We create several object book class
Each object called class
Book HitchHiker new Book The HitchHiker Guide Galaxy Douglas Adams Book ShortHistory new Book A Short History Nearly Everything Bill Bryson Book IceStation new Book Ice Station Zebra Alistair MacLean These three object used read purchased borrowed shared

I studying Local Binary Pattern I trouble understanding following part number output label binary pattern et al
Another extension original operator us called
For uniformity measure pattern used U pattern number bitwise transition vice versa bit pattern considered circular
A local binary pattern called uniform uniformity measure
For example pattern transition transition transition uniform whereas pattern transition transition
In uniform LBP mapping separate output label uniform pattern pattern assigned single label
Thus number different output label mapping pattern P bit P
For instance uniform mapping produce output label neighborhood sampling point label neighborhood sampling point
I understand number different LBP output label P
Could someone explain
Thnx help Update I think I idea already I included example book A pattern uniformity measure exactly determined value b bit position first bit different bit position j first bit th different bit
We may example pattern
How many choice triple b j
Clearly two choice b
For j choice j choice
Thus total number choice j To need add three label zero one label pattern uniformity measure strictly

branch focus classifying according inherent difficulty relating
A computational problem understood task principle amenable solved computer equivalent stating problem may solved mechanical application mathematical step
A problem regarded inherently difficult solution requires significant resource whatever algorithm used
The theory formalizes intuition introducing mathematical study problem quantifying amount resource needed solve time storage

One role computational complexity theory determine practical limit computer
Closely related field theoretical computer science
A key distinction analysis algorithm computational complexity theory former devoted analyzing amount resource needed particular algorithm solve problem whereas latter asks general question possible algorithm could used solve problem
More precisely computational complexity theory try classify problem solved appropriately restricted resource
In turn imposing restriction available resource distinguishes computational complexity computability theory latter theory asks kind problem principle solved algorithmically
A viewed infinite collection together every instance
The input string computational problem referred problem instance confused problem
In computational complexity theory problem refers abstract question solved
In contrast instance problem rather concrete utterance serve input decision problem
For example consider problem

For reason complexity theory address computational problem particular problem instance
When considering computational problem problem instance
Usually alphabet taken binary alphabet set thus string
As mathematical object bitstrings must suitably encoded
For example represented encoded directly via encoding binary
Even though proof theorem regularly assume concrete choice input encoding one try keep discussion abstract enough independent choice encoding
This achieved ensuring different representation transformed efficiently
one central object study computational complexity theory

The problem consists deciding whether given graph
The formal language associated decision problem set connected course obtain precise definition language one decide graph encoded binary string
A computational problem single output expected every input output complex yes
Notable example include
It tempting think notion function problem much richer notion decision problem
However really case since function problem recast decision problem
For example multiplication two integer expressed set triple relation hold
Deciding whether given triple member set corresponds solving problem multiplying two number
To measure difficulty solving computational problem one may wish see much time best algorithm requires solve problem
However running time may general depend instance
In particular larger instance require time solve
Thus time required solve problem space required measure complexity calculated function size instance
This usually taken size input bit
Complexity theory interested algorithm scale increase input size
For instance problem finding whether graph connected much time take solve problem graph vertex compared time taken graph vertex
If input size time taken expressed function
Since time taken different input size different time complexity T defined maximum time taken input size
If T polynomial algorithm said algorithm
say problem solved feasible amount resource admits polynomial time algorithm

For precise definition mean solve problem using given amount time space computational model used
The deterministic Turing machine input total number state transition step machine make halt output answer yes
A Turing machine said operate within time time required input length

The complexity refer three different way measuring time complexity complexity measure different input size
Since input size may faster solve others define following complexity For example consider deterministic sorting algorithm
This solves problem sorting list integer given input
The input sorted sorted reverse order algorithm take time case
If assume possible permutation input list equally likely average time taken sorting O log
The best case occurs pivoting divide list half also needing O log time
To classify computation time similar resource space consumption one interested proving upper lower bound minimum amount time required efficient algorithm solving given problem
The complexity algorithm usually taken complexity unless specified otherwise
Analyzing particular algorithm fall field
To show upper bound time complexity problem one need show particular algorithm running time
However proving lower bound much difficult since lower bound make statement possible algorithm solve given problem
The phrase possible algorithm includes algorithm known today algorithm might discovered future
To show lower bound problem requires showing algorithm time complexity lower
Upper lower bound usually stated using hide constant factor smaller term
This make bound independent specific detail computational model used
For instance big O notation one would write O
A set problem related complexity

For complexity class defined way desirable prove relaxing requirement say computation time indeed defines bigger set problem
In particular although DTIME contained DTIME would interesting know inclusion strict
For time space requirement answer question given time space hierarchy theorem respectively
They called hierarchy theorem induce proper hierarchy class defined constraining respective resource
Thus pair complexity class one properly included
Having deduced proper set inclusion proceed make quantitative statement much additional time space needed order increase number problem solved
More precisely state The state The time space hierarchy theorem form basis separation result complexity class
For instance time hierarchy theorem tell u P strictly contained EXPTIME space hierarchy theorem tell u L strictly contained PSPACE
Many complexity class defined using concept reduction
A reduction transformation one problem another problem
It capture informal notion problem least difficult another problem
For instance problem solved using algorithm difficult say

The commonly used reduction reduction
This mean reduction process take polynomial time
For example problem squaring integer reduced problem multiplying two integer
This mean algorithm multiplying two integer used square integer
Indeed done giving input input multiplication algorithm
Thus see squaring difficult multiplication since squaring reduced multiplication
This motivates concept problem hard complexity class
A problem class problem every problem reduced
Thus problem harder since algorithm allows u solve problem
Of course notion hard problem depends type reduction used
For complexity class larger P reduction commonly used
In particular set problem hard NP set problem
If problem hard said
This mean hardest problem
Since many problem could equally hard one might say one hardest problem
Thus class problem contains difficult problem NP sense one likely Because problem P NP solved able reduce known problem Π another problem Π would indicate known solution Π
This solution Π would yield solution Π
Similarly NP problem reduced set finding problem solved polynomial time would mean P NP
The complexity class P often seen mathematical abstraction modeling computational task admit efficient algorithm

Problems known intractable sense include
If NP P problem also intractable sense
However identification inexact solution large exponent large constant term grows quickly may impractical practical size problem conversely solution grows slowly may practical realistic input solution take long time worst case may take short time case average case thus still practical
Saying problem P imply large case problem hard even
For example decision problem shown P yet algorithm written solve problem reasonable time case
Similarly algorithm solve wide range size le quadratic time routinely handle large instance
To see algorithm generally unusable practice consider program make operation halting
For small say assuming sake example computer operation second program would run year order magnitude
Even much faster computer program would useful small instance sense intractability problem somewhat independent technological progress

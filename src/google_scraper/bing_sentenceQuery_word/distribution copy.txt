Well look like stumbled upon one application python
It appears ANACONDA distribution tool code module needed data science
As free open source distribution mean ANACONDA distribution product shared among people product editable
Like go library orient whole package according need know
Open Source mean source code available use modify without licensing issue unless making something plan commerciallise
So ya sum
If starting learn probably dont need look plan head learning data science
ANACONDA one platform tool several others
To learn python basic dont bother simply get python interpreter window case linux preinstalled good go

field study distributed system
A model component located communicate coordinate action
The component interact order achieve common goal
Three significant characteristic distributed system concurrency component independent failure component
Examples distributed system vary
A run distributed system called distributed programming process writing program
There many alternative message passing mechanism including pure HTTP connector
A goal challenge pursued computer scientist practitioner distributed system however goal fallen favour industry distributed system different conventional system difference partial system failure partial upgrade simply papered attempt transparency see
also refers use distributed system solve computational problem
In problem divided many task solved one computer communicate message passing
The word term distributed system distributed programming originally referred computer network individual computer physically distributed within geographical area
The term nowadays used much wider sense even referring autonomous run physical computer interact message passing
While single definition distributed system following defining property commonly used A distributed system may common goal solving large computational problem user perceives collection autonomous processor unit
Alternatively computer may user individual need purpose distributed system coordinate use shared resource provide communication service user
Other typical property distributed system include following Distributed system group networked computer goal work
The term distributed computing lot overlap clear distinction exists
The system may characterized parallel distributed processor typical distributed system run concurrently parallel
Parallel computing may seen particular tightly coupled form distributed computing distributed computing may seen loosely coupled form parallel computing
Nevertheless possible roughly classify concurrent system parallel distributed using following criterion The figure right illustrates difference distributed parallel system
Figure schematic view typical distributed system system represented network topology node computer line connecting node communication link
Figure b show distributed system detail computer local memory information exchanged passing message one node another using available communication link
Figure c show parallel system processor direct access shared memory
The situation complicated traditional us term parallel distributed quite match definition parallel distributed see detailed discussion

Various hardware software architecture used distributed computing
At lower level necessary interconnect multiple CPUs sort network regardless whether network printed onto circuit board made loosely coupled device cable
At higher level necessary interconnect running CPUs sort
Distributed programming typically fall one several basic architecture category
Another basic aspect distributed computing architecture method communicating coordinating work among concurrent process

Alternatively enable distributed computing done without form direct utilizing shared
Reasons using distributed system distributed computing may include Examples distributed system application distributed computing include following Many task would like automate using computer type would like ask question computer produce answer
In task called
Formally computational problem consists together instance
Instances question ask solution desired answer question
Theoretical computer science seek understand computational problem solved using computer efficiently
Traditionally said problem solved using computer design produce correct solution given instance

Examples related problem include
A lot research also focused understanding nature distributed system process designating single organizer task distributed among several computer node
Before task begun network node either unaware node serve coordinator leader task unable communicate current coordinator
After coordinator election algorithm run however node throughout network recognizes particular unique node task coordinator
The network node communicate among order decide get coordinator state
For need method order break symmetry among
For example node unique comparable identity node compare identity decide node highest identity coordinator
The definition problem often attributed LeLann formalized method create new token token token lost
Coordinator election algorithm designed economical term total transmitted time
The algorithm suggested Gallager Humblet Spira general undirected graph strong impact design distributed algorithm general influential paper distributed computing

A general method decouples issue graph family design coordinator election algorithm suggested Korach Kutten Moran
In order perform coordination distributed system employ concept coordinator
The coordinator election problem choose process among group process different processor distributed system act central coordinator
Several central coordinator election algorithm exist
So far focus distributed system solves given problem
A complementary research problem property given distributed system
The analogous example field centralised computation given computer program task decide whether halt run forever
The halting problem general case naturally understanding behaviour computer network least hard understanding behaviour one computer
However many interesting special case decidable
In particular possible reason behaviour network machine
One example telling whether given network interacting asynchronous machine reach deadlock
This problem decidable likely efficient centralised parallel distributed algorithm solves problem case large network

When Ray Kurzweil met Google CEO Larry Page last July looking job
A respected inventor become futurist Kurzweil wanted discus upcoming book
He told Page read early draft wanted start company develop idea build truly intelligent computer one could understand language make inference decision
It quickly became obvious effort would require nothing le data computing power
I could try give access Page told Kurzweil
But going difficult independent So Page suggested Kurzweil never held job anywhere company join Google instead
It take Kurzweil long make mind January started working Google director engineering
This culmination literally year focus artificial intelligence say
Kurzweil attracted Google computing resource also startling progress company made branch AI called deep learning
software attempt mimic activity layer neuron neocortex wrinkly percent brain thinking occurs
The software learns real sense recognize pattern digital representation sound image data
The basic software simulate neocortex large array neuron artificial neural network decade old led many disappointment breakthrough
But improvement mathematical formula increasingly powerful computer computer scientist model many layer virtual neuron ever
With greater depth producing remarkable advance speech image recognition
Last June Google system shown million image YouTube video proved almost twice good previous image recognition effort identifying object cat
Google also used technology cut error rate speech recognition latest Android mobile software
In October Microsoft chief research officer Rick Rashid wowed attendee lecture China demonstration speech software transcribed spoken word English text error rate percent translated text simulated voice uttering Mandarin
That month team three graduate student two professor contest held Merck identify molecule could lead new drug
The group used deep learning zero molecule likely bind target
Google particular become magnet deep learning related AI talent
In March company bought startup cofounded Geoffrey Hinton University Toronto computer science professor part team Merck contest
Hinton split time university Google say plan take idea field apply real problem image recognition search understanding say
All normally cautious AI researcher hopeful intelligent machine may finally escape page science fiction
Indeed machine intelligence starting transform everything communication computing medicine manufacturing transportation
The possibility apparent IBM Watson computer us technique trained help doctor make better decision
Microsoft deployed deep learning Windows Phone Bing voice search
Extending deep learning application beyond speech image recognition require conceptual software breakthrough mention many advance processing power
And probably see machine agree think year perhaps ever
But say Peter Lee head Microsoft Research USA deep learning reignited grand challenge artificial There many competing approach challenge
One feed computer information rule world required programmer laboriously write software familiar attribute say edge sound
That took lot time still left system unable deal ambiguous data limited narrow controlled application phone menu system ask make query saying specific word
Neural network developed long dawn AI research looked promising attempted simulate way brain worked though greatly simplified form
A program map set virtual neuron assigns random numerical value weight connection
These weight determine simulated neuron mathematical output digitized feature edge shade blue image particular energy level one frequency phoneme individual unit sound spoken syllable
Some today artificial neural network train recognize complex pattern
Programmers would train neural network detect object phoneme blitzing network digitized version image containing object sound wave containing phoneme
If network accurately recognize particular pattern algorithm would adjust weight
The eventual goal training get network consistently recognize pattern speech set image human know say phoneme image dog
This much way child learns dog noticing detail head shape behavior like furry barking animal people call dog
But early neural network could simulate limited number neuron could recognize pattern great complexity
They languished
In Hinton others helped spark revival interest neural network deep model made better use many layer software neuron
But technique still required heavy human involvement programmer label data feeding network
And complex speech image recognition required computer power available
Finally however last decade researcher made fundamental conceptual breakthrough
In Hinton developed efficient way teach individual layer neuron
The first layer learns primitive feature like edge image tiniest unit speech sound
It finding combination digitized pixel sound wave occur often chance
Once layer accurately recognizes feature fed next layer train recognize complex feature like corner combination speech sound
The process repeated successive layer system reliably recognize phoneme object
Like cat
Last June Google demonstrated one largest neural network yet billion connection
A team led Stanford computer science professor Andrew Ng Google Fellow Jeff Dean showed system image million randomly selected YouTube video
One simulated neuron software model fixated image cat
Others focused human face yellow flower object
And thanks power deep learning system identified discrete object even though human ever defined labeled
What stunned AI expert though magnitude improvement image recognition
The system correctly categorized object theme image percent time
That might sound impressive percent better previous method
And Dean note category choose correctly slotting object required example distinguishing two similar variety skate fish
That would challenging even human
When system asked sort image general category accuracy rate jumped percent
Training many layer virtual neuron experiment took computer kind computing infrastructure Google developed search engine service
At least percent recent advance AI attributed availability computer power reckons Dileep George cofounder startup Vicarious
There sheer size Google data center though
Deep learning also benefited company method splitting computing task among many machine done much quickly
That technology Dean helped develop earlier career Google
It vastly speed training neural network well enabling Google run larger network feed lot data
Already deep learning improved voice search smartphones
Until last year Google Android software used method misunderstood many word
But preparation new release Android last July Dean team helped replace part speech system one based deep learning
Because multiple layer neuron allow precise training many variant sound system recognize scrap sound reliably especially noisy environment subway platform
Since likelier understand actually uttered result return likelier accurate well
Almost overnight number error fell good many reviewer deem Android voice search smarter Apple famous Siri voice assistant
For advance everyone think deep learning move artificial intelligence toward something rivaling human intelligence
Some critic say deep learning AI general ignore much brain biology favor computing
One critic Jeff Hawkins founder Palm Computing whose latest venture Numenta developing system biologically inspired use deep learning
Numenta system help predict energy consumption pattern likelihood machine windmill fail
Hawkins author book brain work might provide guide building intelligent machine say deep learning fails account concept time
Brains process stream sensory data say human learning depends ability recall sequence pattern watch video cat something funny motion matter series still image like Google used experiment
Google attitude lot data make everything Hawkins say
But make everything computing resource company like Google throw problem dismissed
They crucial say advocate brain still much complex today neural network
You need lot computational resource make idea work say Hinton
Although Google le forthcoming future application prospect intriguing
Clearly better image search would help YouTube instance
And Dean say model use phoneme data English quickly train system recognize spoken sound language
It also likely sophisticated image recognition could make Google car much better
Then search ad underwrite
Both could see vast improvement technology better faster recognizing people really looking even realize
Sergey Brin said want build benign version HAL A Space This intrigue Kurzweil long vision intelligent machine
In high school wrote software enabled computer create original music various classical style demonstrated appearance TV show
Since invention included several reading machine software could scan digitize printed text font music synthesizer could sound orchestral instrument speech recognition system large vocabulary
Today envisions cybernetic friend listens phone conversation read track every let tell thing want know even ask
This immediate goal Google match Google cofounder Sergey Brin said company early day wanted build equivalent sentient computer HAL one kill people
For Kurzweil aim help computer understand even speak natural language
My mandate give computer enough understanding natural language useful better job search better job answering question say
Essentially hope create flexible version IBM Watson admires ability understand query quirky long tiresome speech delivered frothy pie Watson correct answer What meringue harangue Kurzweil focused solely deep learning though say approach speech recognition based similar theory brain work
He want model actual meaning word phrase sentence including ambiguity usually trip computer
I idea mind graphical way represent semantic meaning language say
That turn require comprehensive way graph syntax sentence
Google already using kind analysis improve grammar translation
understanding also require computer grasp human think meaning
For Kurzweil tap Knowledge Graph Google catalogue million topic location people plus billion relationship among
It introduced last year way provide searcher answer query link
Finally Kurzweil plan apply algorithm help computer deal soft boundary ambiguity If sound daunting
understanding goal finished point search say
That project I think I ever Though Kurzweil vision still year reality deep learning likely spur application beyond speech image recognition nearer term
For one drug discovery
The surprise victory Hinton group Merck contest clearly showed utility deep learning field expected make impact
That
Microsoft Peter Lee say promising early research potential us deep learning machine use imaging application industrial inspection robot guidance
He also envisions personal sensor deep neural network could use predict medical problem
And sensor throughout city might feed system could instance predict traffic jam might occur

As ANNs many issue arise naively trained DNNs
Two common issue computation time
DNNs prone overfitting added layer abstraction allow model rare dependency training data
method Ivakhnenko unit pruning applied training combat overfitting
Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits unit hidden layer training
This help exclude rare dependency
Finally data augmented via method cropping rotating smaller training set increased size reduce chance overfitting
DNNs must consider many training parameter size number layer number unit per layer learning rate initial weight
optimal parameter may feasible due cost time computational resource
Various trick batching computing gradient several training example rather individual example speed computation

Data science much machine learning though
Data data science may may come mechanical process survey data could manually collected clinical trial involve specific type small data might nothing I discussed
But main difference fact data science cover whole spectrum data processing algorithmic statistical aspect
In particular data science also cover Of course many organisation data scientist focus one part process

Thanks Hari Very clear master piece indeed
Talking Machine Learning I think main challenge make decision option contradictory
If contradiction problem would solved using deterministic logic however complex
Making decision contradiction emotional system used
I would suggest add comparison Theory Complexity
I think overlap trying discover emergent behaviour
All reflects key struggle capture simple term statistical learning using handle task decision making
But characterization like When algorithm automated automated piloting car called AI specifically deep learning
quite arbitrary
What statistician data scientist past le friendly widespread use relevant field developing
For example manufacturing became computer aided dramatically changed velocity volume production still manufacturing
And idea manufacturing machine programmed task done human conceived Jacquard Bouchon et
The Jacquard loom operates principle modern computer controlled loom
Data Science body knowledge encompassing statistical computing method varying mix varying degree irritation community explained
Machine learning deep learning cognitive computing whatever learning term come enabling machine think reason like human basically displacing natural intelligence take granted part human range artificial method thus artificial intelligence task ranging simple complex
For example driverless car emulating present human driving driving condition naturally presented human I say present may time even idea human would operate machine might seem alien term driving seem antiquated taking new semantic
Where get ludicrous basic stuff like algorithm playing chess GO projected explaining human brain work
Explaining bird fish brain work difficult current state knowledge represent projection learning still inaccessible u
How fruit fly hundred neuron still mystifying neuroscience
What cognition work natural realm another axis get collapsed hubris surrounding data science
Dimensional reduction method unsupervised learning anyway

One topic seems come regularly mailing list online discussion merit lack thereof Computer Science Degree
An argument seems come time negative party coding number year never used recursion
So question This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built
By way Mario typical name ArrangeString function join I surprised language choice already implementation
Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division
In English definition say greatest common divisor number zero number greatest common divisor two number greatest common divisor remainder dividing
If like know work see Wikipedia article
Let compute gcd example
Each step equal one In first step equal zero second part definition applies
mod go remainder
At step second part applies time mod divide remainder
At step second argument answer
Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood
EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

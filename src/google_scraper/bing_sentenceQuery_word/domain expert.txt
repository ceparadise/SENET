During year analytics career prospective employer client often asked
Clearly description data scientist mythical unicorn computer science skill statistical knowledge domain expertise impact
The proliferation different analytics discipline social network analysis digital analytics supply chain analytics lends weight argument
There also anecdote web data science project went pear shaped analyst subject matter expert
A deeper look anecdote reveals issue due lack domain expertise due poor data science data bad sampling method unnecessary data cleansing
Still myth domain expertise trump else continues
Data mining competition demonstrated opposite shown data science successfully outsourced people without domain expertise
Many company run competition diverse topic optimizing flight route predicting ocean health diabetic retinopathy detection
Data scientist little expertise domain responded brilliantly useful solution
I background biology
Some data scientist even across multiple domain indicating data science skill transferable across domain
The counter argument Kaggle success competition domain expert already generated posing right competitor need
But brave new world massive data along mathematical tool computing power crunch number old world paradigm hypothesizing modeling likely challenged
Google shown whole new way understanding world without model theory approach language learning
So domain expertise necessary step posing
In experience domain knowledge data capture transformation process sensor acquired exploration raw data
Often good data scientist become subject expert playing data asking question domain expert data anomaly
For instance using process analytics team manufacturing company identified long standing previously undiscovered anomaly summarised sale inventory feed large retailer
This anomaly materially affected retail inventory reporting fixed programmatically
Subsequently data science team member
Domain expertise relevant perhaps particularly insight gained using unsupervised learning working complex physical process
An example situation use perform multiple aircraft fleet aircraft sensor maintenance data
While analysis started model interpretation result path analysis subsequent improve aircraft safety certainly required domain expertise
Returning back original question response follows
So hiring data scientist focus machine learning aspect particularly desire play data using number different technique language

What continues baffling amidst controversy necessity domain knowledge building data system year year data mining competition organized repeatedly proved Data Science deliver solution without presence Domain Experts
In competition Data Scientists minimal domain knowledge submitted excellent entry
In fact well known Data Scientists like competition across different solid Data Science skill universally applicable
There one counter argument posed success story
In many competition Domain Experts provided initial asking appropriate question preparing data
The competitor later took material developed model tested performance
Google demolished reliance business hypothesis offering alternative method understanding business absence Another school thought argues Domain Experts involved participate iterative manner rather sequential step
So value Domain Experts likely perceived Data Science project
Many time capturing exploring raw data Data Scientists get stumped gap anomaly collected data Domain Experts practical wisdom operational experience easily fill
During process good Data Scientists mature Domain Experts period time
Another important function Domain Experts play data visualization data seen interpreted rare insight
An example found airline fleet
Although prior model existed interpretive analysis result path analysis led improved understanding aircraft safety condition would possible without sound domain expertise
Two safe conclusion drawn discussion significance Data Science Domain Expertise developing robust solution Data Scientists strong Machine Learning skill analytical mind quickly grasp solve business problem exchanging sharing acquired domain learning Domain Experts different stage system development

Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Around world employer need versatile engineer capable developing range computer application
As company agency increasingly rely computer technology demand continues soar
Computer science broad field undergraduate computer science program learn variety language program application
The diverse ability engineer develop school prepare range professional opportunity begin working
After graduation computer science student expect find skill demand many available position field computer engineer fill
In Bureau Labor Statistics projected increase job software engineer developer ensuring computer science student market degree expand

As part degree cover following foundation computer science Accreditation powerful indicator program quality
Regardless enrollment level area study degree seeker confirm prospective school accreditation status enrolling
This particularly true student specialized subject like computer science individual program accreditation often important accreditation
More nation degree granting institution accredited regionally
The Department Education ED directly accredit school
Instead government enforces universal standard accrediting body
All accreditors must officially recognized ED Council Higher Education Accreditation considered official
college university receive two type accreditation national regional
Unless enrolling course vocational technical school regional accreditation need consider
Regional accreditation much common nation degree granting institution accredited regionally
Regional accreditation ensures three thing given program Employers graduate school professional organization may recognize computer science degree program accredited
Worse may get quality education need compete position field graduate
You confirm accreditation status school country searching
Program accreditation matter regional accreditation technical program
If earning BA computer science example worry program accreditation long school regionally accredited
On hand seeking bachelor engineering concentration computer science absolutely confirm program accreditation
While many field rely multiple agency evaluate program Accreditation Board Engineering Technology recognized accreditor undergraduate graduate program applied science computing engineering engineering technology

Remember unaccredited falsely accredited school attract student program considered diploma mill reason
They sell degree education
Protect confirm school accreditation status apply
Whether transferring another school applying first time generally need admitted school apply CS department
Many CS program formally admit new student major semester
Regardless status take prerequisite early possible two reason General admission requirement vary slightly school
Most college requirement incoming freshman transfer student
If decide take class online locally applying another school make sure coursework accredited accepted credit institution may attend future
Don waste time money taking prerequisite unaccredited school
Direct admission allows applicant enter CS department immediately upon admission school large department admit freshman transfer applicant directly major year
Students admitted directly enjoy access upper division course lab facility research assistantships internship normally reserved upperclassmen
Admission requirement early applicant usually student admission criterion much rigorous
Department admission officer looking application reflect Like degree today Bachelor Computer Science significant financial cost
If attend local college annual tuition could little
For larger school number could easily surpass per year
For online program average total cost Bachelor Degree Computer Science around
Wherever attend likely free
Fortunately growing field scholarship common
Large company Google Microsoft Intel offer scholarship studying computer science
Governmental department focus technology also offer scholarship
Some scholarship award set competition others based previous accomplishment
In addition scholarship financial aid available fund coursework

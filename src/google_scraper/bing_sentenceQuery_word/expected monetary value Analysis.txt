How quantitatively prioritize risk
Would prioritize risk highest probability occurrence risk greatest monetary impact
This Expected Monetary Value EMV come rescue Project Risk Management
After conducting Qualitative Risk Analysis list risk priority urgency assigned
By using Expected Monetary Value quantify risk determine whether qualitative analysis backed number
Expected Monetary Value recommended tool technique Quantitative Risk Analysis Project Risk Management
For PMP exam need know calculate Expected Monetary Value
To calculate Expected Monetary Value project risk management need The value get performing Step Expected Monetary Value
This value positive opportunity positive risk negative
Project risk management requires address type project risk
Suppose leading construction project
Weather cost construction material labor turmoil key project risk found construction project Regardless type project change
Hence though example construction industry theory applicable industry software development manufacturing
Next let see quantify project risk calculating Expected Monetary Value risk
In Expected Monetary Value example two negative project risk Weather Labor Turmoil positive project risk Cost Construction Material
The Expected Monetary Value project risk Though highest impact caused Labor Turmoil project risk Expected Monetary Value lowest
This probability occurring low
This mean The project Expected Monetary Value based project risk Therefore risk occur construction project project would lose
In scenario project manager add budget compensate
This simplistic Expected Monetary Value calculation example
Another technique used calculate complex Expected Monetary Value calculation conducting Decision Tree Analysis
This analysis help making complex project risk management decision
For detail read article
As project manager may apply different production technique minimize risk
For example example based software development manufacturing project manager could use
However method computing Expected Monetary Value project risk management would change

PMP Exam Preparation Study Materials Lessons Learned Contact Hours PMP FAQ etc
By I writing blog post expected monetary value EMV upon receiving request visitor blog named Mohammad Anjum
This technique important part risk management usually used large complex project
Expected monetary value used Perform Quantitative Risks Analysis process one technique PMBOK Guide involves mathematical calculation
Therefore many aspirant leave topic try avoid whole concept
On surface technique may look complex however simple technique involves simple mathematical calculation
Once understand concept like piece cake
Moreover concept also important PMP exam point view
In PMP test going see question expected monetary value analysis
By avoiding concept miss important concept also leave many question unattended exam
To understand concept I suggest read blog post follow example set
Before start discussing expected monetary value concept talk probability impact brief EMV calculation going use
If understand probability face difficulty understanding expected monetary value properly
Probability measurement likelihood occurrence event
For example toss coin either show head tail
There chance showing head chance showing tail
So case say probability showing head tail
Let discus mathematically
The formula calculate probability Probability event happening Number favorable event occur Total number event Now let see formula fit tossing coin
Total number event coin either show head tail Total number favorable event Therefore probability showing head Number favorable event Total number event So toss coin probability showing head
Got
If let give another example
Suppose throwing dice probability number coming
If throw dice show either
Therefore total number event Now want dice show number
Total number favorable event Therefore probability showing number Number favorable event Total number event So throw dice probability number showing
Now let find probability getting either number number
In case total number favorable event Therefore probability showing either number number Number favorable event Total number event So throw dice probability getting either
This short introduction probability
Now come impact
Here say impact amount spend identified risk occurs
For example identified peak project equipment may break may need buy new equipment cost USD
So impact risk USD
This short description impact
I hope probability impact clear
If yes move topic
expected monetary value EMV
Expected monetary value EMV statistical technique risk management used convert risk number turn assist project manager calculate help compare risk risk
According PMBOK Guide edition definition expected monetary value follows Expected monetary value analysis statistical concept calculates average outcome future includes scenario may may Therefore say
It help calculating amount required manage identified risk

It help selecting choice involves le money manage risk
To calculate expected monetary value event must probability impact occurs
Once get data multiply probability impact result expected monetary value
Therefore Expected Monetary Value EMV Probability Impact If multiple risk calculate EMV risk separately add
Please note calculate EMV risk regardless whether positive risk negative risk
If negative risk EMV negative positive risk EMV positive

Once calculate expected monetary value project add amount work package cost estimate get project baseline
The amount added work package cost estimate known contingency reserve
For example let say four risk probability impact follows From table say may need USD manage risk
Why
Because risk going happen altogether
Some may happen may
The risk occur add EMV pool risk occur utilize money pool
So case may need add USD budget cover identified risk
The expected monetary value concept work well calculate contingency reserve expect lot risk risk identify spread contingency reserve better among risk
If identified fewer risk get enough spread reserve may dry sooner
Positive risk play important role calculating contingency reserve
You must identify include positive risk expected value calculation
Expected monetary value also help selecting best decision
For example risk identified two risk response strategy manage risk
So select best strategy
You use expected monetary value select best risk response strategy manage risk
How
You calculate expected monetary value response select one lowest value
Now time see example expected monetary value analysis
You identified risk chance occurring
However risk occurs may cost USD
Calculate expected monetary value EMV risk event
Given question Probability risk Impact risk USD We know Expected monetary value EMV probability impact Hence expected monetary value EMV risk event USD
You identified opportunity chance happening
However positive risk occurs may help gain USD
Calculate expected monetary value EMV risk event
Given question Probability risk Impact risk USD We know Expected monetary value EMV probability impact Hence expected monetary value EMV risk event USD
In project identified two risk chance occurring
If risk occur cost USD USD respectively
What expected monetary value risk event
In question two negative risk therefore expected monetary value two risk sum expected monetary value risk individually
Expected monetary value two risk event EMV first event EMV second event EMV first event EMV second event Hence EMV two risk event Therefore expected monetary value EMV two event USD
During risk management planning team identified three risk probability
If first two risk occur cost USD USD however third risk occurs give benefit USD
Determine expected monetary value risk event
Expected monetary value three event EMV first event EMV second event EMV third event EMV first event EMV second event EMV third event EMV three event EMV first event EMV second event EMV third event Hence expected monetary value EMV three event USD
I selected four simplest type example expected monetary value analysis show EMV calculation different scenario
In real PMP exam see question based four basic type
I believe understand example face problem solving question based expected monetary value
The expected monetary value offer many benefit risk management planning
A follows The following drawback expected monetary analysis If large project want complete successfully within budget schedule escape expected monetary value analysis
You must perform risk management technique help develop decision tree contingency reserve
This help increase confidence level achieving project objective
Here blog post expected monetary value EMV end
If something say comment section
image credit Stuart I like
Thanks Felix
This short EMV guide great tool everyone particularly trying understand apply important concept project risk stand
Thanks much
Thank Warsi sahab comment
Expected monetary value important concept risk management involves mathematical calculation causing many professional leave topic
I hope blog post help understand concept better
Jazak Allah Khair writing nice blog post request
This help understand risk management concept
Here blog post I little confusion Probability tell u chance occurring risk event
probability mean chance occurring risk event risk event occurred consume impact value expected monitory value
And identified risk event happens different time shall loss using expected monitory value EMV impact value actually consumed occurring risk event
It rare identified risk occur
If happens mean risk management plan wrong miscalculated probability
EMV provides pool risk occurs utilize money impact money manage risk risk occur save money pool
Hi Usmani Thanks blog helpful one query So based EMV contingency reserve applied
What impact amount taken consideration calculation As I clear probability impact USD emv
CR would Wat happen risk occurs end need USD impact amount get Contingency reserve reserve risk
Some happen rest
So identified risk occurs use money pool
The larger number risk spread risk impact good
Hope clear
It nice blog learn project management especially beginner like
Could please explain positive risk due mind term risk mean negative impact
If impact positive risk benefit
Jazakumullah khair Please refer blog post common risk management term Would please give example two risk response strategy single risk event
Let give real world example
Suppose going place plane chance flight may cancelled
This risk identified two option reach place
The first option use public transport bus second option hire rental car
The bus take time cost le private car cost reach place earlier
Now two risk response strategy select one
Hope help
Now clear
Jazak Allah Khair Now I would like raise one request write blog post Decision Tree Monte Carlo simulation

Thanks good article
Though I bit confused EMV explanation PMBOK page Fig
The decision made higher EMV article mentioned You calculate expected monetary value response select one lowest value
Could please clarify
In case opportunity go highest choice provides highest value however threat go lowest option
Thanks Fahad
Please make clear note happen one risk probability negative risk occur impact USD
It consume contingency reserve
In case get money contingency reserve could management reserve else
Please explain
Thanks lot Walaikum assalam Tauseef I already said Some may happen may
The risk occur add EMV pool risk occur utilize money Anyway comment made clear
How say EMV average outcome scenario may may happen future look like total EMVs average define dividing sum value set number
Please explain clear
Thanks much As per understanding Risk management people oriented process based subjective evaluation objective process
Here finding cumulative emv risk event adding together
You already discounted multiplying percentage need discount

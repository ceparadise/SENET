In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine

In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address

However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment

The concept distance valid element object size typically given
For example character containing fourth element containing character offset three start
In programming usually denotes number address location added order get specific
In original meaning offset basic address unit usually used specify offset size
In context offset sometimes called
In instruction offset embedded within certain instruction provided range byte
For example within unconditional branch instruction xxx hexadecimal offset provided byte offset base register branch
An odd offset would cause unless base register also contained odd address since instruction aligned boundary execute without program hardware
The previous example describes indirect way address memory location format segment offset
For example assume want refer memory location
One way accomplished first defining segment beginning address defining offset
Further also allowed shift hexadecimal segment reach final absolute memory address
One thing note reach final absolute address many way

For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary

You could wire build computer operate would fiendishly expensive right
On hand computer relatively cheap
So computer use binary number therefore use place decimal digit
The word shortening word Binary digIT
Whereas decimal digit possible value ranging bit two possible value
Therefore binary number composed like
How figure value binary number
You way use base instead base
So You see binary number bit hold value increasing power
That make counting binary pretty easy
Starting zero going counting decimal binary look like When look sequence decimal binary number system
At number see carrying first take place binary system
If bit add bit becomes next bit becomes
In transition effect roll bit turning
Bits rarely seen alone computer
They almost always bundled together collection collection called
Why bit byte
A similar question Why egg dozen
The byte something people settled trial error past year
With bit byte represent value ranging shown In article learn CD us byte bit per sample

What vertical microinstruction
Ans A vertical microinstruction microinstruction state one sequence operation required carry machine language instruction
Vertical microinstructions short bit instruction
They called vertical normally listed vertically page
These bit microinstructions instruction needed carry one machine language instruction
In addition vertical microinstructions horizontal diagonal microinstructions well Â

technique imposes interpreter hardware architectural level computer
As microcode layer instruction implement instruction internal sequencing many element
Microcode used well specialized processor hardware
Microcode typically resides special memory translates machine instruction data input sequence detailed operation
It separate machine instruction underlying instruction designed altered freely
It also facilitates building complex instruction reducing complexity computer circuit
Writing microcode often called microcode particular processor implementation sometimes called
More extensive microcoding allows small simple powerful architecture wider relatively simple way achieve software compatibility different product processor family
Some hardware vendor especially use term synonym
In way code within device termed regardless microcode example said microcode updated though typically contain microcode firmware
When compared normal application program element composing microprogram exist lower conceptual level
To avoid confusion element differentiated prefix microinstruction microassembler microprogrammer etc
Engineers normally write microcode design phase processor storing ROM PLA structure combination
However machine also exist microcode stored
This traditionally denoted context computer either
In latter case CPU initialization process load microcode control store another storage medium possibility altering microcode correct bug instruction set implement new machine instruction
Complex digital processor may also employ one possibly order delegate must performed essentially asynchronously parallel
A programmer even programmer normally see change microcode
Unlike machine code often retains among different processor family microcode run exact designed constitutes inherent part particular processor design
Microprograms consist series microinstructions control CPU fundamental level hardware circuitry
For example single typical microinstruction might specify following operation To simultaneously control processor feature one cycle microinstruction often wider bit bit emulator feature
Microprograms carefully designed optimized fastest possible execution slow microprogram would result slow machine instruction degraded performance related application program use instruction
Microcode originally developed simpler method developing control logic computer
Initially CPU
Each step needed fetch decode execute machine instruction including operand address calculation read writes controlled directly rather minimal state machine circuitry
While efficient need powerful instruction set addressing complex operation made processor difficult design debug highly encoded instruction contribute well especially irregular encoding used
Microcode simplified job allowing much processor behaviour programming model defined via microprogram routine rather dedicated circuitry
Even late design process microcode could easily changed whereas CPU design cumbersome change
Thus greatly facilitated CPU design
From late large portion programming done instruction mean greater programmer productivity important advantage microcode relative ease powerful machine instruction defined
The ultimate extension Directly Executable High Level Language design statement language entirely directly executed microcode without compilation
The Fountainhead Processor example
During CPU speed grew quickly memory speed numerous technique used alleviate
machine instruction made possible microcode helped fewer complex machine instruction require le memory bandwidth
For example operation character string done single machine instruction thus avoiding multiple instruction fetch
Architectures instruction set implemented complex microprograms included
The approach increasingly complex instruction set later called
An alternate approach used many use instead combinational logic mainly instruction decoding let simple state machine without much microcode sequencing
The example microprocessor using PLA instruction decode sequencing
The PLA visible photomicrograph chip operation seen simulation
Microprogramming still used modern CPU design
In case microcode debugged simulation logic function substituted control store
Logic function often faster le expensive equivalent microprogram memory
A processor microprograms operate primitive totally different much architecture assembly instruction visible normal programmer
In coordination hardware microcode implement architecture
The underlying hardware need fixed relationship visible architecture
This make easier implement given instruction set architecture wide variety underlying hardware
The IBM architecture register implementation actually use hardware implemented much simpler underlying microarchitecture example data path arithmetic logic unit ALU main memory implemented register special unit data path ALU data path main memory also implemented register special unit core memory
The full data path implement register special unit core memory
The Model Model larger data path implement register faster transistor circuit
In way microprogramming enabled IBM design many model substantially different hardware spanning wide range cost performance making architecturally compatible
This dramatically reduces number unique system software program must written model
A similar approach used Digital Equipment Corporation DEC VAX family computer
As result different VAX processor use different microarchitectures yet architecture change
Microprogramming also reduces cost field change correct defect processor bug often fixed replacing portion microprogram rather change made wiring
In design introduced concept control store way simplify computer design move beyond method
The control store lattice one dimension accepts control time pulse CPU internal clock connects control signal gate circuit
A pulse distributor take pulse generated CPU clock break eight separate time pulse activates different row lattice
When row activated activates control signal connected
Described another way signal transmitted control store played much like roll
That controlled sequence wide word constructed played sequentially
In control store however song short repeated continuously
In enhanced concept adding concept akin computer software
His initial implementation consisted pair matrix first one generated signal manner Whirlwind control store second matrix selected row signal microprogram instruction word speak invoke next cycle
Conditionals implemented providing way single line control store could choose alternative second matrix
This made control signal conditional detected internal signal
Wilkes coined term describe feature distinguish simple control store
Each microinstruction microprogram provides bit control functional element internally compose CPU
The advantage CPU internal CPU control becomes specialized form computer program
Microcode thus transforms complex electronic design challenge control CPU le complex programming challenge
To take advantage CPU divided several part There may also used access main
Together element form
Most modern several execution unit
Even simple computer usually one unit read write memory another execute user code
These element could often brought together single chip
This chip come fixed width would form slice execution unit
These known chip
The family one best known example bit slice element
The part execution unit execution unit interconnected bundle wire called
Programmers develop microprograms using basic software tool
A allows programmer define table bit symbolically
Because close relationship underlying architecture microcode several property make difficult generate using compiler
A program intended execute bit way electronics allows much freedom debug microprogram
After microprogram finalized extensively tested sometimes used input computer program construct logic produce data
This program similar used optimize
No known computer program produce optimal logic even good logic vastly reduce number transistor number required ROM control store
This reduces cost producing electricity consumed CPU
Microcode characterized referring primarily whether microinstruction control CPU element little decoding horizontal microcode requires extensive decoding vertical microcode
Consequently horizontal microinstruction wider contains bit occupies storage space vertical microinstruction
Horizontal microcode several discrete combined single microinstruction simultaneous operation
Horizontal microcode typically contained fairly wide control store uncommon word bit
On tick sequencer clock microcode word read decoded used control functional element make CPU
In typical implementation horizontal microprogram word comprises fairly tightly defined group bit
For example one simple arrangement might For type micromachine implement JUMP instruction address following opcode microcode might require two clock tick
The engineer designing would write microassembler source code looking something like For tick common find portion CPU used remaining group bit microinstruction
With careful design hardware microcode property exploited parallelise operation use different area CPU example case ALU required first tick could potentially used complete earlier arithmetic instruction
In vertical microcode microinstruction significantly encoded bit field generally pas intermediate combinatory logic turn generates actual control sequencing signal internal CPU element ALU register etc
This contrast horizontal microcode bit field either directly produce control sequencing signal minimally encoded
Consequently vertical microcode requires smaller instruction length le storage requires time decode resulting slower CPU clock
Some vertical microcode assembly language simple conventional computer emulating complex computer
Some processor processor CMOS microprocessor later IBM mainframe mainframe term used Alpha processor term used IBM mainframe microprocessor
This form machine code access special register hardware resource available regular machine code used implement instruction function page table walk Alpha processor
Another form vertical microcode two field The selects part CPU controlled word control store
The actually control part CPU
With type microcode designer explicitly chooses make slower CPU save money reducing unused bit control store however reduced complexity may increase CPU clock frequency lessens effect increased number cycle per instruction
As transistor became cheaper horizontal microcode came dominate design CPUs using microcode vertical microcode used le often
When vertical horizontal microcode used horizontal microcode may referred
A computer built using writable microcode
In design rather storing microcode ROM logic microcode stored RAM called
Such computer sometimes called
Many experimental prototype computer use writable control store also commercial machine use writable microcode early workstation Nautilus family number IBM implementation DEC machine
Many machine offer writable control store option including DEC series
The IBM includes facility called invoked console part another processor complex
Some commercial machine example IBM storage writable control store microcode
WCS offer several advantage including ease patching microprogram certain hardware generation faster access ROMs provide
WCS allows user optimize machine specific purpose
Starting several Intel CPUs writable microcode
This example allowed bug Intel microcode fixed patching microprograms rather requiring entire chip replaced
The design trend toward heavily microcoded processor complex instruction began early continued roughly
At point design philosophy started becoming prominent
A CPU us microcode generally take several clock cycle execute single instruction one clock cycle step microprogram instruction
Some processor include instruction take long time execute
Such variation interfere far important modern system
When designing new processor RISC following advantage microcoded CISC There counterpoint well Many RISC processor designed execute every instruction long cache single cycle
This similar way CPUs microcode execute one microinstruction per cycle
VLIW processor instruction behave similarly wide horizontal microcode although typically without control hardware provided microcode
RISC instruction sometimes similar narrow vertical microcode
Microcoding popular processor

I come across many NoSQL database SQL database
There varying parameter measure strength weakness database scalability one
What difference horizontally vertically scaling database
pool resource whereas
An easy way remember think machine server rack add machine across direction add resource machine direction
In database world often based partitioning data
node contains part data data resides single node scaling done
spreading load CPU RAM resource machine
With often easier scale dynamically adding machine existing pool often limited capacity single machine scaling beyond capacity often involves downtime come upper limit
A good example horizontal scaling Cassandra MongoDB good example vertical scaling MySQL Amazon RDS The cloud version MySQL
It provides easy way scale vertically switching small bigger machine
This process often involves downtime
Data Grids often optimized horizontal vertical scaling simply bound disk
partitioning support
You read subject earlier post Horizontal scalability ability increase capacity connecting multiple hardware software entity work single logical unit
When server clustered original server scaled horizontally
If cluster requires resource improve performance provide high availability HA administrator scale adding server cluster
An important advantage horizontal scalability provide administrator ability increase capacity fly
Another advantage theory horizontal scalability limited many entity connected successfully
The distributed storage system Cassandra example run top hundred commodity node spread across different data center
Because commodity hardware scaled horizontally Cassandra fault tolerant single point failure SPoF
Vertical scalability hand increase capacity adding resource memory additional CPU machine
Scaling vertically also called scaling usually requires downtime new resource added limit defined hardware
When Amazon RDS customer need scale vertically example switch smaller bigger machine Amazon largest RDS instance GB memory
Scaling horizontally advantage disadvantage
For example adding inexpensive commodity computer cluster might seem solution first glance important administrator know whether licensing cost additional server additional operation cost powering cooling large footprint occupy data center truly make scaling horizontally better choice scaling vertically
Horizontal Scaling also referred basically addition machine setting cluster distributed environment software system
This usually requires program component standard tier architectural model
responsible distribute user request load among various cluster
Each machine run copy software hence capable servicing request
This one various function load balancer may performing
Another common responsibility load balancer us protocol exchange heartbeat message server ensure running fine
distributes load maintaining state machine many request served machine machine idle machine queued request etc
So load balancing algorithm considers thing redirecting request appropriate server machine
It also take account network overhead might choose server nearest provided available service request
The also done different way Load Balancer always act intermediary program every response In case request handed server load balancer response server user go load balancer
So server machine actually servicing request never directly interface user machine running client application
The machine hosting load balancer program handling user
Load Balancer act intermediary response coming server machine In case server received request bypass load balancer communicates response directly client
Setting cluster interface client application really complete architecture design
There still lot critical question answered number key design decision made affect overall property system
We first need identify business goal area would like add value
These goal give rise various requirement
We ask various question respect different systemic property
Will design address performance requirement
What performance characteristic care
Is overall system throughput interested serving maximum number request given time
Or system response time design sending back response client le time possible
Both many type performance characteristic related
Will design address availability requirement
Is system
If degree
Is design reliable
Does impact correctness
We forget correctness implicit goal system
Are really meeting scalability goal
Might achieving immediate one going happen long run
All kind requirement quantifiable measure associated
We make important design decision questioning developing prototype refining design
Firstly using approach distribute load horizontally scale system
Do various server node communicate
If yes system address situation one node go permanently temporarily
If yes system address situation network connecting node node running
Most importantly differentiate two situation
How
All make distributed system interesting challenging design implement
Vertical Scaling also referred approach attempt increase capacity single machine By adding processing power By adding storage More memory etc Summary What important understand difference scaling approach identify suit requirement see application really fit model choose
As would understood horizontal scaling come overhead form cluster setup management maintenance cost complexity
The design get increasingly complex programming model change
So simply throwing new hardware adding node machine way start
First see requirement met increasing capacity tuning characteristic single machine
If go approach combination
There additional architecture mentioned database service enable horizontal scaling without complexity manual sharding
These service sharding background enable run traditional SQL database scale like would NoSQL engine like MongoDB CouchDB
Two service I familiar PostgreSQL MySQL
I saw Xeround explains SQL database difficult differently treat grain salt vendor post
Also check Wikipedia nice explanation SQL NoSQL service list vendor scaling option combination
Yes scaling horizontally mean adding machine also implies machine equal cluster
MySQL scale horizontally term Reading data use replica reach capacity server begin sharding data across server
This becomes increasingly complex
Often keeping data consistent across replica problem replication rate often slow keep data change rate
Couchbase also fantastic NoSQL Horizontal Scaling database used many commercial high availability application game arguably highest performer category
It partition data automatically across cluster adding node simple use commodity hardware cheaper vm instance using Large instead High Mem High Disk machine AWS instance
It built Membase Memcached add persistence
Also case Couchbase every node read writes equal cluster failover replication full dataset replication across server like mySQL
see excellent Cisco benchmark Here great blog post Couchbase Architecture Traditional relational database designed database system
They scaled horizontally process tends complex error prone
NewSQL database likeNuoDB distributed database system designed scale horizontally maintaining property traditional RDBMS
For information NuoDB read technical whitepaper
SQL database like Oracle also support Horizontal scaling Shared disk cluster
For example Oracle RAC IBM purescale Sybase ASE Cluster edition
New node added Oracle RAC system purescale system achieve horizontal scaling
But approach different noSQL database like mongodb CouchDB IBM Cloudant data sharding part Horizontal scaling
In noSQL database data shraded horizontal scaling

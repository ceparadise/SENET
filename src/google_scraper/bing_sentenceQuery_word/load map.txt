In composed pair possible key appears collection
Operations associated data type allow The classic computer science problem task designing maintains set data operation
The two major solution dictionary problem
In case also possible solve problem using directly addressed specialized structure
Many programming language include associative array available many others
form direct support associative array
Associative array many application including fundamental
In associative array association key value often known binding word binding may also used refer process creating new association
The operation usually defined associative array Often instead add reassign single operation add new pair one already exist otherwise reassigns
In addition associative array may also include operation determining number binding constructing loop binding
Usually operation order binding returned may arbitrary
A generalizes associative array allowing multiple value associated single key
A related abstract data type binding operate direction value must associated unique key second lookup operation take value argument look key associated value
Suppose set loan made library represented data structure
Each book library may checked single library patron time
However single patron may able check multiple book
Therefore information book checked patron may represented associative array book key patron value
Using notation data structure would A lookup operation key Great Expectations would return John
If John return book would cause deletion operation Pat check book would cause insertion operation leading different state For dictionary small number binding may make sense implement dictionary using binding
With implementation time perform basic dictionary operation linear total number binding however easy implement constant factor running time small
Another simple implementation technique usable key restricted narrow range integer direct addressing array value given key stored array cell binding cell store special indicates absence binding
As well simple technique fast dictionary operation take constant time
However space requirement structure size entire keyspace making impractical unless keyspace small
The two major approach implementing dictionary
The frequently used general purpose implementation associative array combined separate key separate bucket array
The basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple operation
Therefore average overhead operation hash table computation key hash combined accessing corresponding bucket within array
As hash table usually perform O time outperform alternative situation
Hash table need able handle hash function map two different key bucket array
The two widespread approach problem
In separate chaining array store value store another container usually store value matching hash
On hand open addressing hash collision found table seek empty spot array store value deterministic manner usually looking next immediate position array
Open addressing lower ratio separate chaining table mostly empty
However table becomes filled element open addressing performance degrades exponentially
Additionally separate chaining us le memory case unless entry small le four time size pointer
Another common approach implement associative array
Compared hash table structure advantage weakness
The performance binary search tree significantly better hash table time complexity O log
This contrast hash table whose performance involves element sharing single bucket resulting O time complexity
In addition like binary search tree binary search tree keep element order
Thus traversing element follows pattern whereas traversing hash table result element seemingly random order
However hash table much better time complexity binary search tree O performance highly unlikely good used
It worth noting binary search tree used implement bucket hash table us separate chaining
This allows constant lookup assures performance O log
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element linked list similar data structure
Associative array may also stored unbalanced data structure specialized particular type key implementation method le efficient hash table well placing greater restriction type data handle
The advantage alternative structure come ability handle operation beyond basic one associative array finding binding whose key closest queried key query present set binding
Associative array implemented programming language package many language system provide part standard library
In language built standard system special syntax often using subscripting
syntactic support associative array introduced name table
made associative array optionally persistent key data structure
supported one possible implementation set map
Most modern scripting language starting including support associative array primary container type
In many language available library function without special syntax
In called called called see called since typically use implementation
In array associative except key limited integer string
In JavaScript see also object behave associative array key Map WeakMap type take arbitrary object key
In Lua called used primitive building block data structure
In called
The also support associative array
Most program using associative array point need store data permanent form like
A common solution problem generalized concept known produce text binary representation original object written directly file
This commonly implemented underlying object model like Cocoa include standard function convert internal data text form
The program create complete text representation group object calling method almost always already implemented base associative array class
For program use large data set sort individual file storage appropriate DB required
Some DB system natively store associative array serializing data storing serialized data key
Individual array loaded saved database using key refer
These used many year history long common RDBs lack standardization among reason limited use certain niche role
RDBs used role case although saving object RDB complicated problem known
After need high performance database suitable closely matching internal structure program using led renaissance store market
These system store retrieve associative array native fashion greatly improve performance common workflow

HashMap two important property size load factor
I went Java documentation say initial load factor
But I ca find actual use
Can someone describe different scenario need set load factor sample ideal value different case
The explains pretty well An instance HashMap two parameter affect performance initial capacity load factor
The capacity number bucket hash table initial capacity simply capacity time hash table created
The load factor measure full hash table allowed get capacity automatically increased
When number entry hash table exceeds product load factor current capacity hash table rehashed internal data structure rebuilt hash table approximately twice number bucket
As general rule default load factor offer good tradeoff time space cost
Higher value decrease space overhead increase lookup cost reflected operation HashMap class including get put
The expected number entry map load factor taken account setting initial capacity minimize number rehash operation
If initial capacity greater maximum number entry divided load factor rehash operation ever occur
As performance optimization good idea avoid optimizing thing prematurely
without hard data bottleneck
Default initial capacity take load factor current map size
The load factor represents level capacity doubled
product capacity load factor
This represents storing key value pair capacity becomes
Actually calculation perfect load factor closer log
Although load factor le yield better performance
I think probably pulled hat
Proof Chaining avoided branch prediction exploited predicting bucket empty
A bucket probably empty probability empty exceeds
Let represent size n number key added
Using binomial theorem probability bucket empty Thus bucket probably empty le As reach infinity number key added P approach log rapidly From The load factor measure full hash table allowed get capacity automatically increased It really depends particular requirement rule thumb specifying initial load factor
The amount capacity exhausted HashMap increase capacity
Load factor default initial capacity therefore bucket free increase capacity make many new bucket new hashcodes pointing exist increase number bucket
If set loading factor say something interesting might happen
Say adding object x hashmap whose hashCode hashmap bucket representing hashcode free get added bucket say adding another object whose hashCode also object get added sure BUT end bucket performance impact
Since longer present head bucket perform lookup time taken going time depends many item bucket
This called hash collision way even happens loading factor le
free bucket high performance high space requirement
I would pick table size n n n would give load factor without division slow system especially portable system division hardware

In implement structure map
A hash table us compute array desired value found
Ideally hash function assign key unique bucket hash table design employ imperfect hash function might cause hash hash function generates index one key
Such collision must accommodated way
In hash table average cost number lookup independent number element stored table
Many hash table design also allow arbitrary insertion deletion pair constant average cost per operation
In many situation hash table turn efficient lookup structure
For reason widely used many kind computer particularly associative array
The idea hashing distribute entry pair across array
Given key algorithm computes suggests entry found Often done two step In method independent array size index number using
In case array size remainder operation reduced improves speed increase problem poor hash function
A good hash function implementation algorithm essential good hash table performance may difficult achieve
A basic requirement function provide hash value
A distribution increase number collision cost resolving
Uniformity sometimes difficult ensure design may evaluated empirically using statistical test discrete uniform distribution
The distribution need uniform table size occur application
In particular one us dynamic resizing exact doubling halving table size hash function need uniform size
Here index computed range bit hash function
On hand hashing algorithm prefer size
The modulus operation may provide additional mixing especially useful poor hash function
For scheme hash function also avoid mapping two key consecutive slot
Such clustering may cause lookup cost skyrocket even load factor low collision infrequent
The popular multiplicative hash claimed particularly poor clustering behavior
believed provide good hash function table size either reduction
They may also appropriate risk malicious user trying network service submitting request designed generate large number collision server hash table
However risk sabotage also avoided cheaper method applying secret data using
A drawback cryptographic hashing function often slower compute mean case uniformity size necessary hashing function might preferable
If key known ahead time used create perfect hash table collision
If used every location hash table used well
Perfect hashing allows lookup case
This contrast chaining open addressing method time lookup low average may large O instance key hash value
A critical statistic hash table defined As load factor grows larger hash table becomes slower may even fail work depending method used
The expected property hash table assumes load factor kept bound
For number bucket time lookup grows number entry therefore desired constant time achieved
Second one examine variance number entry per bucket
For example two table entry bucket one exactly one entry bucket entry bucket
Clearly hashing working second one
A low load factor especially beneficial
As load factor approach proportion unused area hash table increase necessarily reduction search cost
This result wasted memory
Hash practically unavoidable hashing random subset large set possible key
For example key hashed million bucket even perfectly uniform random distribution according approximately chance least two key hashed slot
Therefore almost hash table implementation collision resolution strategy handle event
Some common strategy described
All method require key pointer stored table together associated value
In method known bucket independent sort entry index
The time hash table operation time find bucket constant plus time list operation
In good hash table bucket zero one entry sometimes two three rarely
Therefore structure efficient time space case preferred
Structures efficient fairly large number entry per bucket needed desirable
If case happen often hashing function need fixed
Chained hash table popular require basic data structure simple algorithm use simple hash function unsuitable method
The cost table operation scanning entry selected bucket desired key
If distribution key cost lookup depends average number key per roughly proportional load factor
For reason chained hash table remain effective even number table entry much higher number slot
For example chained hash table slot stored key load factor five ten time slower table load factor still time faster plain sequential list
For scenario entry inserted bucket case hash table ineffective cost searching bucket data structure
If latter linear list lookup procedure may scan entry cost proportional number entry table
The bucket chain often searched sequentially using order entry added bucket
If load factor large key likely come others rearranging chain may effective
More sophisticated data structure balanced search tree worth considering load factor large hash distribution likely one must guarantee good performance even scenario
However using larger table better hash function may even effective case
Chained hash table also inherit disadvantage linked list
When storing small key value space overhead pointer entry record significant
An additional disadvantage traversing linked list poor making processor cache ineffective
Some chaining implementation store first record chain slot array
The number pointer traversal decreased one case
The purpose increase cache efficiency hash table access
The disadvantage empty bucket take space bucket one entry
To save space hash table often many slot stored entry meaning many slot two entry
Instead list one use data structure support required operation
For example using theoretical time common hash table operation insertion deletion lookup brought rather O
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element list
A real world example hash table us binary search tree bucket class
The variant called us store entry hash slot
Each newly inserted entry get appended end dynamic array assigned slot
The dynamic array resized manner meaning grown many byte needed
Alternative technique growing array block size found improve insertion performance cost space
This variation make efficient use TLB slot entry stored sequential memory position
It also dispenses pointer required linked list save space
Despite frequent array resizing space overhead incurred operating system memory fragmentation found small
An elaboration approach bucket contains entry organized perfect hash table slot
While us memory slot entry worst case slot average case variant guaranteed constant lookup time low amortized time insertion
It also possible use bucket achieving constant time operation high probability
In another strategy called open addressing entry record stored bucket array
When new entry inserted bucket examined starting slot proceeding unoccupied slot found
When searching entry bucket scanned sequence either target record found unused array slot found indicates key table
The name open addressing refers fact location address item determined hash value
This method also called confused open hashing closed addressing usually mean separate chaining
probe sequence include A drawback open addressing scheme number stored entry exceed number slot bucket array
In fact even good hash function performance dramatically degrades load factor grows beyond
For many application restriction mandate use dynamic resizing attendant cost
Open addressing scheme also put stringent requirement hash function besides distributing key uniformly bucket function must also minimize clustering hash value consecutive probe order
Using separate chaining concern many object map hash value whether adjacent nearby completely irrelevant
Open addressing save memory entry small le four time size pointer load factor small
If load factor close zero far bucket stored entry open addressing wasteful even entry two
Open addressing avoids time overhead allocating new entry record implemented even absence memory allocator
It also avoids extra indirection required access first entry bucket usually one
It also better particularly linear probing
With small record size factor yield better performance chaining particularly lookup
Hash table open addressing also easier use pointer
On hand normal open addressing poor choice large element element fill entire line negating cache advantage large amount space wasted large empty table slot
If open addressing table store reference element external storage us space comparable chaining even large record loses speed advantage
Generally speaking open addressing better used hash table small record stored within table internal storage fit cache line
They particularly suitable element one le
If table expected high load factor record large data chained hash table often perform well better
Ultimately used sensibly kind hash table algorithm usually fast percentage calculation spent hash table code low
Memory usage rarely considered excessive
Therefore case difference algorithm marginal consideration typically come play
A hybrid chaining open addressing link together chain node within table
Like open addressing achieves space usage somewhat diminished cache advantage chaining
Like chaining exhibit clustering effect fact table efficiently filled high density
Unlike chaining element table slot
Another alternative solution ensures constant lookup time worst case constant amortized time insertion deletion
It us two hash function mean pair could two location
For lookup first hash function used found second hash function used
If collision happens insertion key second hash function map another bucket
If hash function used still collision key collided removed make space new key old key one hash function map another bucket
If location also result collision process repeat collision process traverse bucket point table resized
By combining multiple hash function multiple cell per bucket high space utilization achieved
Another alternative solution combine approach yet seems general avoid limitation
In particular work well even load factor grows beyond
The algorithm well suited implementing resizable
The hopscotch hashing algorithm work defining neighborhood bucket near original hashed bucket given entry always found
Thus search limited number entry neighborhood logarithmic worst case constant average proper alignment neighborhood typically requires one cache miss
When inserting entry one first attempt add bucket neighborhood
However bucket neighborhood occupied algorithm traverse bucket sequence open slot unoccupied bucket found linear probing
At point since empty bucket outside neighborhood item repeatedly displaced sequence hop
This similar cuckoo hashing difference case empty slot moved neighborhood instead item moved hope eventually finding empty slot
Each hop brings open slot closer original neighborhood without invalidating neighborhood property bucket along way
In end open slot moved neighborhood entry inserted added
One interesting variation collision resolution Robin Hood hashing
The idea new key may displace key already inserted probe count larger key current position
The net effect reduces worst case search time table
This similar ordered hash table except criterion bumping key depend direct relationship key
Since worst case variation number probe reduced dramatically interesting variation probe table starting expected successful probe value expand position direction
External Robin Hood hashing extension algorithm table stored external file table position corresponds page bucket record
employ two different hash function hash table
Both hash function used compute two table location
When object inserted table placed table location contains fewer object default table location equality bucket size
hashing employ principle power two choice
The good functioning hash table depends fact table size proportional number entry
With fixed size common structure similar linear search except better constant factor
In case number entry may definitely known advance example keywords language
More commonly known sure due later change code data
It one serious although common mistake provide way table resize
A hash table class almost always way resize good practice even simple custom table
An implementation check load factor something becomes large need done insert since thing would increase
To keep load factor certain limit many table implementation expand table item inserted
For example class default load factor threshold table expansion table size resized load factor greater
Since bucket usually implemented top constant proportion resizing greater keep load factor desired limit exact choice constant determined dynamic array
Resizing accompanied full incremental table whereby existing item mapped new bucket location
To limit proportion memory wasted due empty bucket implementation also shrink size item deleted
From point tradeoff operation similar deallocation dynamic array
A common approach automatically trigger complete resizing load factor exceeds threshold
Then new larger table entry removed old table inserted new table
When entry removed old table old table returned free storage pool
Symmetrically load factor fall second threshold entry moved new smaller table
For hash table shrink grow frequently resizing downward skipped entirely
In case table size proportional maximum number entry ever hash table one time rather current number
The disadvantage memory usage higher thus cache behavior may worse
For best control operation provided request
If table size increase decrease fixed percentage expansion total cost resizings insert delete operation still constant independent number entry number operation performed
For example consider table created minimum possible size doubled time load ratio exceeds threshold
If element inserted table total number extra occur dynamic resizings table
In word dynamic resizing roughly double cost insert delete operation
Some hash table implementation notably pay price enlarging hash table may interrupt operation
If one avoid dynamic resizing solution perform resizing gradually hash table almost always use alternative rehashing since cost rebuilding entire table disk would high
One alternative enlarging table perform rehashing gradually To ensure old table completely copied new table need enlarged necessary increase size table factor least resizing
If known key value always increase decrease variation achieved keeping list single recent key value hash table resize operation
Upon lookup key fall range defined list entry directed appropriate hash indeed hash different range
Since common grow overall number entry doubling range check binary search time redirection would O log log
As consistent hashing approach guarantee key hash issued never change even hash table later grown
hash table algorithm permit incremental hash table expansion
It implemented using single hash table two possible lookup function
Another way decrease cost table resizing choose hash function way hash value change table resized
Such hash function prevalent rehashing prohibitively costly
The problem designing hash value change table resized known problem
The four popular approach algorithm distance
In simplest model hash function completely unspecified table resize
For best possible choice hash function table size open addressing collision hold element single comparison successful lookup table size chaining key minimum collision comparison lookup
For worst choice hash function every insertion cause collision hash table degenerate linear search Ω amortized comparison per insertion comparison successful lookup
Adding rehashing model straightforward
As geometric resizing factor implies key inserted time total number insertion bounded O
By using rehashing maintain table using chaining open addressing unlimited element perform successful lookup single comparison best choice hash function
In realistic model hash function probability distribution hash function performance computed average choice hash function
When distribution assumption called simple uniform hashing shown hashing chaining requires comparison average unsuccessful lookup hashing open addressing requires
Both bound constant maintain using table resizing fixed constant le
The main advantage hash table table data structure speed
This advantage apparent number entry large
Hash table particularly efficient maximum number entry predicted advance bucket array allocated optimum size never resized
If set pair fixed known ahead time insertion deletion allowed one may reduce average lookup cost careful choice hash function bucket table size internal data structure
In particular one may able devise hash function even perfect
In case key need stored table
Although operation hash table take constant time average cost good hash function significantly higher inner loop lookup algorithm sequential list search tree
Thus hash table effective number entry small
However case high cost computing hash function mitigated saving hash value together key
For certain string processing application hash table may le efficient
Also many possible key key represented small enough number instead hash table one may use key directly index array value
Note collision case
The entry stored hash table enumerated efficiently constant cost per entry order
Therefore efficient way locate entry whose key given key
Listing entry specific order generally requires separate sorting step whose cost proportional log per entry
In comparison ordered search tree lookup insertion cost proportional log allow finding nearest key cost enumeration entry constant cost per entry
If key stored hash function may easy way enumerate key present table given moment
Although cost per operation constant fairly small cost single operation may quite high
In particular hash table us insertion deletion operation may occasionally take time proportional number entry
This may serious drawback interactive application
Hash table general exhibit poor data accessed distributed seemingly random memory
Because hash table cause access pattern jump around trigger miss cause long delay
Compact data structure array searched may faster table relatively small key compact
The optimal performance point varies system system
Hash table become quite inefficient many collision
While extremely uneven hash distribution extremely unlikely arise chance knowledge hash function may able supply information hash creates behavior causing excessive collision resulting poor performance
In critical application data structure better guarantee used however prevents attacker predicting input cause preferable
The hash function used hash table Linux cache changed Linux version countermeasure attack
Hash table commonly used implement many type table
They used implement array whose index arbitrary complicated object especially like
When storing new item hash collision occurs multimap unconditionally store item
When storing new item typical associative array hash collision occurs actual key different associative array likewise store item
However key new item exactly match key old item associative array typically era old item overwrites new item every item table unique key
Hash table may also used data structure although popular application
In database system hash table commonly used distribute row amongst node reducing network traffic hash join
Hash table used implement auxiliary data table used speed access data primarily stored slower medium
In application hash collision handled discarding one two colliding erasing old item currently stored table overwriting new item every item table unique hash value
Besides recovering entry given key many hash table implementation also tell whether entry exists
Those structure therefore used implement merely record whether given key belongs specified set key
In case structure simplified eliminating part entry value
Hashing used implement static dynamic set
Several dynamic language use hash table implement object
In representation key name member method object value pointer corresponding member method
Hash table used program avoid creating multiple character string content
For purpose string use program stored single implemented hash table checked whenever new string created
This technique introduced interpreter name used many kind data symbolic algebra system record database file file system binary decision diagram etc
Many programming language provide hash table functionality either associative array standard module
In example class provides hash table key value arbitrary type
The programming language including variant used includes collection
In Zend engine Zend engine respectively use one hash function generate hash value used managing mapping data pointer stored hash table
In PHP source code labelled Daniel Bernstein Times Addition
hash table implementation form type well hash type used internally implement namespaces therefore need pay attention security collision attack
Python also use hash internally fast lookup though store key value
In support hash table provided via generic class store pair generic class store value
In standard library generic structs use linear probing Robin Hood bucket stealing
The idea hashing arose independently different place
In January Luhn wrote internal IBM memorandum used hashing chaining
implemented program using hashing time
Open addressing linear probing relatively prime stepping credited Amdahl Russia idea
There several data structure use hash function considered special case hash table

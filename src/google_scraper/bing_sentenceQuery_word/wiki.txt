Email virus A virus intentionally rather accidentally us email system spread
While virus infected file may accidentally sent email virus aware email system function
They generally target specific type email system Microsoft Outlook commonly used harvest email address various source may append copy email sent may generate email message containing copy attachment
In order avoid detection user virus employ different kind
Some old virus especially platform make sure last modified date host file stay file infected virus
This approach fool antivirus software however especially maintain date file change
Some virus infect file without increasing size damaging file
They accomplish overwriting unused area executable file
These called
For example Chernobyl Virus infects file
Because file many empty gap virus length add size file
Some virus try avoid detection killing task associated antivirus software detect example
In computer operating system grow larger complex old hiding technique need updated replaced
Defending computer virus may demand file system migrate towards detailed explicit permission every kind file access
While kind antivirus software employ various technique counter stealth mechanism infection occurs recourse clean system unreliable
In Microsoft Windows operating system proprietary
This leaf antivirus software little alternative send read request Windows OS file handle request
Some virus trick antivirus software intercepting request OS
A virus hide intercepting request read infected file handling request returning uninfected version file antivirus software
The interception occur actual operating system file would handle read request
Thus antivirus software attempting detect virus either given permission read infected file read request served uninfected version file
The reliable method avoid stealth virus reboot medium known clear
Security software used check dormant operating system file
Most security software relies virus signature employ
Security software may also use database file Windows OS file security software identify altered file request Windows installation medium replace authentic version
In older version Windows file Windows OS file stored allow file overwritten would report altered system file authentic using file hash scan altered file would always guarantee finding infection
Most modern antivirus program try find inside ordinary program scanning
Unfortunately term misleading virus posse unique signature way human being
Such virus signature merely sequence byte antivirus program look known part virus
A better term would search
Different antivirus program employ different search string indeed different search method identifying virus
If virus scanner find pattern file perform check make sure found virus merely coincidental sequence innocent file notifies user file infected
The user delete case clean heal infected file
Some virus employ technique make detection mean signature difficult probably impossible
These virus modify code infection
That infected file contains different variant virus
One method evading signature detection use simple encipher encode body virus leaving encryption module static change one infection next
In case virus consists small decrypting module encrypted copy virus code
If virus encrypted different key infected file part virus remains constant decrypting module would example appended end
In case virus scanner directly detect virus using signature still detect decrypting module still make indirect detection virus possible
Since would symmetric key stored infected host entirely possible decrypt final virus probably required since rarity may reason virus scanner least flag file suspicious
An old compact way use arithmetic operation like addition subtraction use logical condition byte virus constant operation repeated decryption
It suspicious code modify code may part signature many virus definition
A simpler older approach use key encryption consisted operation parameter like incrementing decrementing bitwise rotation arithmetic negation logical NOT
Some virus employ mean encryption inside executable virus encrypted certain event virus scanner disabled update computer
This called
At said time executable decrypt virus execute hidden infecting computer sometimes disabling antivirus software
first technique posed serious virus scanner
Just like regular encrypted virus polymorphic virus infects file encrypted copy decoded module
In case polymorphic virus however decryption module also modified infection
A polymorphic virus therefore part remain identical infection making difficult detect directly using signature
Antivirus software detect decrypting virus using encrypted virus body
To enable polymorphic code virus also called mutating engine engine somewhere encrypted body
See technical detail engine operate
Some virus employ polymorphic code way constrains mutation rate virus significantly
For example virus programmed mutate slightly time programmed refrain mutating infects file computer already contains copy virus
The advantage using slow polymorphic code make difficult antivirus professional investigator obtain representative sample virus bait file infected one run typically contain identical similar sample virus
This make likely detection virus scanner unreliable instance virus may able avoid detection
To avoid detected emulation virus rewrite completely time infect new executables
Viruses utilize technique said
To enable metamorphism metamorphic engine needed
A metamorphic virus usually large complex
For example consisted line code part metamorphic engine
As software often designed security feature prevent unauthorized use system resource many virus must exploit manipulate system application software spread infect computer
strategy produce large number bug generally also produce potential hole entrance virus
In order replicate virus must permitted execute code write memory
For reason many virus attach may part legitimate program see
If user attempt launch infected program virus code may executed simultaneously
In operating system use determine program association Microsoft Windows extension may hidden user default
This make possible create file different type appears user
For example executable may created named user see therefore assumes file likely safe yet opened run executable client machine
The vast majority virus target system running
This due Microsoft large market share user
The diversity software system network limit destructive potential virus malware
operating system allow user choose variety packaging tool mean malicious code targeting system affect subset user
Many Windows user running set application enabling virus rapidly spread among Microsoft Windows system targeting exploit large number host
While Linux Unix general always natively prevented normal user making change environment without permission Windows user generally prevented making change meaning virus easily gain control entire system Windows host
This difference continued partly due widespread use account contemporary version like
In researcher created released virus
Bliss however requires user run explicitly infect program user access modify
Unlike Windows user Unix user administrator except install configure software result even user ran virus could harm operating system
The Bliss virus never became widespread remains chiefly research curiosity
Its creator later posted source code allowing researcher see worked
Many user install detect eliminate known virus computer attempt run executable file may distributed email attachment example
Some antivirus software block known malicious website attempt install malware
Antivirus software change underlying capability host transmit virus
Users must update software regularly hole
Antivirus software also need regularly updated order recognize latest

deception malicious individual pretend friend computer security expert benevolent individual goal convincing targeted individual reveal personal information
Other commonly used preventative measure include timely operating system update software update careful Internet browsing avoiding shady website installation trusted software
Certain browser flag site reported Google confirmed hosting malware Google
There two common method antivirus software application us detect virus described article
The first far common method virus detection using list definition
This work examining content computer memory RAM file stored fixed removable drive hard drive floppy drive USB flash drive comparing file known virus signature
Virus signature string code used identify individual virus virus antivirus designer try choose unique signature string found legitimate program
Different antivirus program use different signature identify virus
The disadvantage detection method user protected virus detected signature recent virus definition update protected new virus see
A second method find virus use based common virus behavior
This method ability detect new virus antivirus security firm yet define signature also give rise using signature
False positive disruptive especially commercial environment may lead company instructing staff use company computer system IT service checked system virus
This slow productivity regular worker
One may reduce damage done virus making regular data operating system different medium either kept unconnected system time hard drive accessible reason using different
This way data lost virus one start using backup hopefully recent
If backup session like closed becomes longer affected virus long virus infected file copied onto
Likewise operating system CD used start computer installed operating system become unusable
Backups removable medium must carefully inspected restoration
The Gammima virus example propagates via removable
Many website run antivirus software company provide free online virus scanning limited cleaning facility purpose website sell antivirus product service
Some subsidiary user upload one suspicious file scanned checked one antivirus program one operation
Additionally several capable antivirus software program available free download Internet usually restricted use
Microsoft offer optional free antivirus utility called updated part regular Windows update regime older optional malware removal tool upgraded antivirus product Windows
Some virus disable important Windows tool
An example virus CiaDoor
Many virus removed computer entering Windows networking using system tool
restore critical system file previous checkpoint
Often virus cause system hang freeze subsequent hard reboot render system restore point day corrupted
Restore point previous day work provided virus designed corrupt restore file exist previous restore point
Microsoft improved Windows later used check repair corrupted system file
Restoring earlier clean copy entire partition copy one earlier backup disk image relatively simple usually remove malware may faster disinfecting reinstalling reconfiguring operating system program scratch described restoring user preference
Reinstalling operating system another approach virus removal
It may possible recover copy essential user data booting connecting hard drive another computer booting second computer operating system taking great care infect computer executing infected program original drive
The original hard drive reformatted OS program installed original medium
Once system restored precaution must taken avoid reinfection restored
Before computer network became widespread virus spread particularly
In early day many user regularly exchanged information program floppy
Some virus spread infecting program stored disk others installed disk ensuring would run user booted computer disk usually inadvertently
Personal computer era would attempt boot first floppy one left drive
Until floppy disk fell use successful infection strategy boot sector virus common wild many year
Traditional computer virus emerged driven spread personal computer resultant increase BBS use software sharing
software sharing contributed directly spread program virus written infect popularly traded software
software equally common virus BBSs
Viruses increase chance spreading computer infecting file file system accessed computer
become common since
Most virus written scripting language Microsoft program spread throughout infecting document
Since Word Excel also available could also spread
Although virus ability send infected virus take advantage COM interface
Some old version Microsoft Word allow macro replicate additional blank line
If two macro virus simultaneously infect document combination two also appear mating two would likely detected virus unique parent
A virus may also send contact friend colleague address stored infected machine
If recipient thinking link friend trusted source follows link website virus hosted site may able infect new computer continue propagating
Viruses spread using first reported academically demonstrated

In nutshell computer science degree deal theoretical foundation information computation taking scientific practical approach computation application
Computation defined type calculation use computing technology follows model algorithm protocol practice information processing turn defined use model transform data computer
Computer science considered many practitioner foundational science one make knowledge achievement possible
The study computer science involves systematically studying methodical process algorithm order aid acquisition representation processing storage communication access information
This done analyzing feasibility structure expression mechanization process relate information
In computer science term information refers usually information encoded bit byte computer memory
Some higher education institution may use computer science CS umbrella term cover various specialist vocational degree involving computer technology
You may also find term computer science used refer information technology IT degree although many institution distinguish two exactly draw line varies
Make sure check chosen university course detail closely
The QS World University Rankings Subject includes ranking
The table sorted location based different criterion used compile ranking including academic reputation employer reputation research citation
Entry requirement computer science degree usually emphasize mathematics institution asking background physic
A background psychology sociology provide added dimension study would gained understanding human process information natural science may also helpful
Undergraduate applicant computer science degree usually expected formally studied computer science university
However recommended pick programming language gain understanding involved
While generally accepted beginner language include Python Haskell Java Pascal language may come across study
On hand may find institution discourage student learning programming beforehand avoid student learning bad programming habit early
Some institution offer joint course computer science studied alongside subject mathematics engineering computing
You expect begin computer science degree developing foundation key
Some core computer science course may cover include theory computation fundamental computer science compliers operating system information theory basic programming system architecture software development testing web application database algorithm data structure principle computer hardware

Last fall I went tour Blue Waters supercomputer University Illinois
I asked whether anyone ever used entire computer
I told always working multiple project
That made wonder usefulness supercomputer
Perhaps Blue Waters unusual shared industry university I know
I assume overhead managing processor memory single supercomputer
Would cost effective build smaller computer
Can anyone help understand value supercomputer
Or sometimes dedicated single project
A typical job Blue Waters using machine consumes total
Blue Waters node mean node hour job running couple minute
That allows scientist use machine somewhat interactively
You see moving average Supercomputers large collection smaller computer
The main reason collect together one place share cost efficiently way
You trying create computer lot work total cost computer power maintenance minimized lifetime computer
There several factor involved total cost ownership The cost equipment one
To minimize cost ownership want equipment useful work large percentage time possible ideally time realistically somewhat le like would considered good equipment burn becomes obsolete
In contrast computer laptop phone probably actually use le time asleep time eating relaxing half time awake even using computer processor idle time
The second cost power
There several part first cost power
Part cost consumed transporting power power plant computer
Part lost computer power supply converting AC power DC power
A larger DC converter usually made efficient
Additionally computer turn useful electric power waste heat
So also need pay remove heat
Again larger air conditioner usually made efficient multiple small air conditioner
The third cost maintenance
By putting together bunch computer designing one go rest keep running amortize cost maintenance staff much larger number computer node could node different placed different building city
The detail Blue Waters cabinet
Each cabinet node
Each node pretty normal computer
Most node AMD Opeteron processor running DRAM
About node instead single AMD Opteron NVidia GPU DRAM
If wanted could buy something similar node put living room play video game
Blue Waters node
Each node probably consumes bit Watts turn power heat
If node living room play video game would particularly big deal
It would consume electricity wall socket generate much heat small personal space heater
In winter would kind nice cozy
In summer run air conditioner frequently keep house comfortable
If running full power day every day electricity bill would go considerably perhaps double consuming
But put together consumes Megawatts generates correspondingly large amount heat
The true engineering marvel Blue Waters like large data center building
It enormous refrigerated box
The Blue Waters building particularly interesting fantastically efficient
About power going building actually used run node
I believe I read somewhere ca find moment lost power conversion removing waste heat
That lot better get gaming computer living room
You probably need power supply another couple hundred Watts run air conditioner
Let put together
By putting together thousand smaller computer spreading usage among many many people keep computer running time sharing resource efficient way
It cost money give people computer sit idle time
The best way save money computation people share computer computer busy time
Blue Waters much computer inside
It specially designed power efficient possible
Part involves putting near power plant reduce power loss power transmission line
Here satelite picture part Champaign IL containing Blue Waters demonstrate supercomputer extremely important modern research
always used total capacity depending management dynamic continual replacement cycle
massive supercomputer used defense industry weapon simulation matching one early impetus invention computer WWII computing projectile trajectory
use highly publicized
modern weapon simulation nuclear weapon highly classified
simulation allow new weapon design tested accurately via computational simulation
US even reject export advanced computing technology country eg China reason supercomputing national security implication another country effective supercomputing simulation
many us
used simulate product design dynamic
example Tide company needed figure mix different ingredient laundry soap optimal way supercomputer used help compute optimum mix
supercomputer involve running multiple different project
used shared resource management strategy choosing project based overall load research value etc
basic value supercomputer large scale computation simply run smaller computer le overall CPU capacity
last decade major shift toward building supercomputer commercial shelf technology aka COTS decrease price still high performance

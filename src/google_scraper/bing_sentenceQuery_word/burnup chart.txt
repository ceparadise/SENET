CaSandra bachelor degree Computer Information Systems taught Agile along Scrum Kanban year
Want watch later
chart used Scrum track report delivery team progress towards completing Sprint work
These chart simple effective visual representation communicate status Sprint
Normally Agile tool help create chart automatically otherwise Scrum Master responsible creating maintaining
To help understand difference compare act baking pie burning eating pie burning
What come first
The ingredient
Let review term used Scrum understand need order create either chart
Scrum popular Agile framework adopted many organization develop software product although framework used type complex product
Scrum promotes iterative development mean every week Scrum team delivers potentially shippable product feature piece functionality valuable customer
The week time frame known
The sprint contains product backlog item commonly referred although could also contain defect
We refer item sprint
Each PBI assigned value represents effort doubt complexity
The point assigned delivery team people development work
You need know sum point committed sprint
PBIs also considered slice pie
For chart delivery team need break PBIs task break task hour
Think task hour crumb pie
This may seem feel bit like team new Scrum yet established velocity help guide towards realistic Sprint commitment since able see many hour think may spend PBIs course sprint
This help show whether total number hour exceeds delivery team capacity total number hour team available
Finally average number point accepted course sprint
For purpose lesson chart need know velocity
Now general understanding terminology used Scrum ingredient let discus chart created
There various way create chart Agile tool built functionality create chart automatically
Otherwise using chart feature Excel sufficient
What mean
Your friend come dinner party brought favorite pie
After dinner maybe everyone grab fork begin eat burn pie slice slice crumb crumb nothing left
The crumb represent task hour
In show hour show date sprint
On day sprint plot sum hour
Each day plot amount hour left complete work
This create progress line chart trend downwards
Many time using Agile tool ideal line created show many hour team burning daily basis
The progress line ideal progress line close one another
At end sprint pie gone meaning task hour crumb left eat
Get FREE access day create account
Baking pie requires lot energy burn calorie mixing ingredient
But chart baking pie slice slice imagine calorie burning
The represents sum point value pie slice PBIs
The represents sprint date
On day plot number point considered done
Then day continue plot number point considered done
The line chart ideally trend upwards
At end sprint team baked whole pie
These chart primarily reserved team using Scrum several sprint move away providing hour task level
Neither chart better depends trying achieve
If teaching team meet sprint commitment often commit may appropriate
However delivery team becomes mature move away breaking slice pie tiny crumb
When focus point chart may better choice
So really chart useful
chart great simple tool help communicate progress sprint
If ca remember one remember pie
Your team either eating pie crumb crumb nothing left baking pie slice slice
There many way create chart either using tool Excel however goal keep simple always conversation instead completely relying chart communicate progress

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Can someone explain build chart
Please give walkthrough build one
Basically burnup chart simply graph plotting total story point across project amount done story point ordinate iteration abscissa
See example burndown chart
So order build burnup chart simply following iteration From source give example based SharePoint likely extract important information The difference chart chart simply way represents information
A project done work remaining zero chart often intuitive plotting intersection project total represent project completion
The intersection X Y ax right chart implicit
Otherwise difference two chart type minimal
Specifically In either case build chart graphing point represent project
This often represented story point whatever unit track ideal hour feature even dollar
Note chart require legend explicit second line identifying project total building towards unless continually adjust scale make top axis implicit total
Regardless represent make sure represent total provide metric valid scale
To plot Burn Up Chart plot work completed per day story point compare estimated work completed
Say need complete story point per sprint
working day
If complete story point first day plot graph
The next day complete story point plot
So forth
Map expected story point burn chart

For project single coach chart great help
It explain lot concept story based development iterative development help coach recognize pattern development take action adjust direction team
I found chart always bit harder understand might look intimidating
So introducing first time paste report email others
It best show person let conversation start

The basic definition flowchart defines diagram represents algorithm
Talking broadly computer science get problem solve
We break problem manageable task often called
Finally small part work together provide solution original problem
Normally get problem tend break number process step taken arrive solution
A flowchart visual representation step
Just word say visually show flow certain program
Flowchart thought visual representation
When programming problem solve first think language gon na write program
We focus problem first figuring needed logic solve problem write flowchart show path took solution problem
Then program using certain language

Problem A program input add display total number
As see particular programming language
Just algorithm
As see initial problem solved using flowchart visually represented algorithm making easier u program
And note similarity flowchart final program
Hope answered question
Flowchart graphical representation algorithm
An algorithm step step procedure solve problem
A flowchart type diagram represents algorithm workflow process showing step box various kind order connecting arrow
This diagrammatic representation illustrates solution model given problem
Flowcharts used analyzing designing documenting managing process program various field
Still question
Ask

learn share knowledge build career
Does anyone know free Agile chart template excel create chart excel
I find lot chart ca find instruction template chart
Thanks As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Here quickie burn I created Google Docs
You able use foundation creating
Hope help
Thanks

Is way get burnup chart build whole project
across version
I use Jira GreenHopper plugin The key setting version appropriately
My setup might work least inspiration I top level version complete project
Then I bunch release version chunk intended get actually released customer
Each project version parent
You define planning board view version card thingies
And finally I version sprint appropriate release version parent
With setup I select version every level chart view work expected
Note finish task afterwards change parent version task get updated accordingly diagram might confusing

Graphs mathematical concept found many us computer science
Graphs come many different flavor many found us computer program
Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part
Edge labeled graph usually drawn label drawn adjacent arc specifying edge
Here following part
Here following part
Here following part
Vertices like called sink
Vertices like called source
Here following part
Graphs often used represent physical entity network road relationship people etc inside computer
There numerous mechansims used

Possible operation include
Not program need operation program efficent representation compute operation needed others suffice
represented function
We could represent Dgraph follows In rest note assume Vertices type Vertices set finite range type
Thus graph represented follows There many many algorithm graph
In note look
They include

Does agile team review velocity burndown predict next iteration
Many team sometimes encounter problem
This happens variety reason The story roughly size manager know velocity really mean velocity show true project state
Fortunately another way solve problem
One problem velocity measure capacity sound measure speed
When team calculate velocity either burndown burnup measure sum total given iteration
That total rough approximation capacity
I call rough approximation unless team work story variation number point story worth
If story small variation matter much
But variation large team encounter problem
One team problem used relative estimation story point deciding story size
It worked product owner create relatively small story
It pretty stable velocity point per iteration
Then product owner changed role company new product owner Dan started work team
Dan wind work previous team took several week meanwhile product owner two team working totally different product
Since Dan new product know make story small previous product owner done
And time workshop story team
So Dan story larger team used
Instead story size Fibonacci sequence Dan story ranged point
The team trouble using velocity measure story size changed much
Even accepted four story half usual point per iteration team trouble finishing work
That estimate precise
They accurate precise
The estimate precise unit measure
The estimation variation large
The team realized velocity longer stable could use predictor project progress
So started use measure
Here worked
The team started demo every day Dan show progress
The demo couple terrific side effect Dan present accept reject story learned product much faster otherwise would
Demos terrific party need see
Unfortunately management team willing
Instead team created product dashboard manager could see team completed still remained done
One team manager famous asking Are done yet When team showed manager product backlog burnup chart manager question
This chart helped manager realize long people kept adding feature team would done
Yes team made progress someone kept adding feature kept finish line sight
It turned several sure particular product took many request project
The team thought great chart different manager wanted know much team completed compared work
The team used product feature chart show manager overall feature growth green line progress feature red line remaining feature blue line
Clearly Features Complete line show entire picture
You might wondering count feature product backlog burnup chart
I count number story
That
The reason I count story customer buy use story
Customers use point
Points activity
Stories value
I like know whether anyone team ahead behind rest team
Cumulative flow show
This chart show developer tester staying close finishing work without much delay development testing
However fair amount work ready analysis state
This particular team product owner liked ready backlog several month ahead team
One problem team discussed work analysis long ever took work
Once team product owner saw chart product owner realized prep might team needed
Sometimes team trouble making progress someone asks team member something another project
That certainly case Dan
I found team create multitasking chart something like one manager understand team making progress everyone expected
Sometimes team release partially complete work often behind flag
Sometimes team wait customer feedback
Sometimes team wait another team deploy work
Sometimes safe team release partial customer need entire feature set
In case useful see state work
This particular team lot work waiting release status
Is literally work progress
It
The WIP might team control useful know work released
Velocity personal team
A team velocity based familiarity code amount automated useful testing team support work story size
If story become large team estimation variance show varying velocity
If need show project progress use measure
I never fan traffic light enough granularity show real project state
And cynical part say project red proved otherwise
You show project progress product backlog burnup chart feature chart
A team monitor cumulative flow make sure team sweet spot looking far enough ahead making sure one behind
And report multitasking data released management team help remove obstacle prevent finishing project
Velocity useful measure capacity
Use data show project progress

In also called basic
A record collection possibly different data type typically fixed number sequence
The field record may also called particularly
Fields may also called though risk confusion element
A may may considered record vice versa depending convention specific programming language
For example date could stored record containing numeric field field represented string numeric field
A Personnel record might contain
A Circle record might contain instance center might represented record containing coordinate
Records distinguished fact number field typically fixed field name field may different type
A describes value variable
Most modern computer language allow programmer define new record type
The definition includes specifying data type field name label accessed
In field name generally preferred due simplicity proper record type studied language
Since record may contain field addition data express many feature
Records exist storage medium including
Records fundamental component data structure especially
Many computer organized array often grouped larger physical record efficiency
The parameter often viewed field record variable argument passed function viewed record value get assigned variable time call
Also often used implement procedure call entry containing procedure parameter local variable return address internal field
An object language essentially record contains procedure specialized handle record object type elaboration record type
Indeed language record special case object known PODSs contrast object use OO feature
A record viewed computer analog
In vein record type viewed computer language analog two implementation abstract specific language
A record may zero A key field set field record serf identifier
A unique key often called simply
For example employee file might contain employee number name department salary
The employee number unique organization would primary key
Depending storage medium file organization employee number might also stored separate file make lookup faster
The department code may unique may also indexed case would considered
If indexed entire employee file would scanned produce listing employee specific department
The salary field would normally considered usable key
Indexing one factor considered designing file
The concept record traced various type used since remote time
The modern notion record computer science field type size already implicit century mechanical calculator
The original medium used data opposed control used record punch card single record
Compare journal entry punch card
Records well established first half century data processing done using punched card
Typically record data file would recorded one punched card specific column assigned specific field
Generally record smallest unit could read external storage
card reader tape disk
Most implementation early special syntax record concept available extensively used use
Some early computer hardware support delimiting record field special instruction copying record
The concept record field central early file utility
first widespread programming language support record type record definition facility quite sophisticated time
The language allows definition nested record alphanumeric integer fractional field arbitrary size precision well field automatically format value assigned insertion currency sign decimal point digit group separator
Each file associated record variable data read written
COBOL also provides statement assigns corresponding field two record according name
The early language developed numeric computing support record type later version language add
The original lacking record except provided adequate surrogate
The one first language fully integrate record type basic type logically consistent type system
The programming language provided record
The programming language initially provided record concept kind template could laid top memory area rather true record data type
The latter provided eventually declaration two concept still distinct language
Most language designed Pascal also supported record
The selection field record value yield value
Some language may provide facility enumerate field record least field reference
This facility needed implement certain service
It requires degree
In system record subtyping operation value record type may also include In setting specific record type implies specific set field present value type may contain additional field
A record field would thus belong type record field would record field
The rationale passing record function expects record argument work since function find field requires within record
Many way practically implementing record programming language would trouble allowing variability matter central characteristic record type theoretical context
Most language allow assignment record exactly record type including field type name order
Depending language however two record data type defined separately may regarded distinct type even exactly field
Some language may also allow assignment record whose field different name matching field value corresponding field variable position within record example field called assigned record variable field
In alternative two operand still required sequence field type
Some language may also require corresponding type size encoding well whole record assigned uninterpreted
Other language may flexible regard require value field legally assigned corresponding variable field example field assigned field vice versa
Other language may match field value name rather position
These possibility apply comparison two record value equality
Some language may also allow order comparison using based comparison individual field
allows preceding type assignment also allows record structure terminology
In Algol array record integer field one could write obtain array integer consisting field element
As result statement would effect
In command would execute command sequence field record declared variable
So instead writing one could write
The representation record memory varies depending programming language
Usually field stored consecutive position memory order declared record type
This may result two field stored word memory indeed feature often used access specific bit word
On hand compiler add padding field mostly invisible programmer order comply alignment constraint imposed field must occupy single word
Some language may implement record array address pointing field possibly name type
Objects language often implemented rather complicated way especially language allow
A type record contains information identify record type locate information within record
It may contain offset element element therefore stored order may omitted
Alternatively various element record including element identifier simply follow one another order
The following show example record definition

Databases used organise data clear consistent way
Most website online application use database
With much data shared online data security important issue
The actual unit data entered give
These unit data also called
When create database need set data type
For example film database might need alphabetical character number
Fields usually restricted certain data type
way classifying data value common property
Different kind data value also need different amount store different operation performed upon
The data type In database programming language data type set follows The structure also called
When design database need create schema explain type data stored
There key area consider data Before creating database need think purpose
What database going used
What search might performed
In film table example structure table would If creating database people data type would use capture someone age
It would best capture age date birth DATE data type eg
An alternative would capture age number like
However need think database
If input someone age need update every time someone year older
This would inefficient time consuming
It would much better enter date birth

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

What difference tuples record
Both let build type multiple simpler type
Some language treat tuples kind record
A tuple ordered group element like
A record typically group named element like value two field labelled value field
The word tuple come common suffix quintuple sextuple septuple octuple mean group respectively
The word record come data table
You think possible tuples field table column correspond field row collect field particular record instance
You treat tuple kind record index element tuple name within equivalent record
I believe Standard ML related language use record basic unit provide type disjunction treat tuples kind record way
According Wikipedia In computer science struct one simplest data structure consisting two value variable stored consecutive memory position component called field member record accessed applying different offset starting address
I would say little difference tuple record
Record complete row data element one table let say student record roll
one table tuple super set record data belongs table also
row record student roll table relationship
attendance result contact fee etc
So whole lot data set one student table tuple
As I know
Thanks

I want store mixed data type array
How could one
You make array element discriminated union aka
The member used hold choice member used array element
So want store first element would When want access element array must first check type use corresponding member union
A statement useful It left programmer ensure member always corresponds last value stored
Use union You keep track type element though
Array element need size possible
You could work around creating The size element union size largest element
There different style defining whatever name IMO make much nicer removing internal union
This style used X Window System thing like Events
The example Barmar answer give name internal union
The example Sp
answer us anonymous union avoid specify every time access variant record
Unfortunately anonymous internal structs union available
It compiler extension therefore inherently
A better way IMO invert whole definition
Make data type struct put tag type specifier struct
Then wrap union
Now may appear repeating
But consider definition likely isolated single file
But eliminated noise specifiying intermediate get data
Instead go end le obnoxious
D Another thing allows form inheritance

One gotcha aware constructing one designated initializers
All member initializers union member
The initializer ignored optimizing compiler initializer follows data area
Even though know layout
No ai
Use internal tag instead overlay outer tag like want confuse compiler
You array separated array But lose information type
If need keep information type way keep third array int int enumerated value Then code function cast depending value
Union standard way go
But solution well
One
That take advantage aligned memory low bit address always zero
For example system pointer int must multiple low bit must hence use store type value
Of course need clear bit dereferencing value
If make sure data aligned one bit tag
On current system virtual address still bit hence high bit also used tag
This one disavantage need memory data stored anywhere
Therefore case type range data limited store value directly pointer
This used Chrome engine check least significant bit address see pointer double signed value called smi small integer
If int Chrome simply arithmetic right shift bit get value otherwise pointer dereferenced
In prior version Mozilla Firefox also use small integer optimization like low bit used store type int string object
etc
But since JaegerMonkey took another path
The value always stored double precision variable
When double normalized one used directly calculation
However high bit denote NaN low store address computer value value directly remaining used store type
This technique called
If main data type best solution delivers good performance
In machine also used address often bit stated
Read technique Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

I decided read Silberschatz Galvin Gagne edition summer
I gotten topic confusing interrupt role relates operating system
The text say operating system begin first process init wait event occur event usually signaled interrupt
The text also say interrupt come either hardware software
How work little detail
Is operating system driven interrupt
I looking big picture understanding
This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
When OS run process init would sent signal manager etc like memory device etc
The interrupt way telling processor OS ready new input etc
So sometime init OS waiting ready interrupt would indicate exactly
So event relates
In regard hardware software interrupt hardware interrupt come hardware
Eg
device like keyboard etc
A hardware interrupt cause processor save state begin execution interrupt handler
On hand software interrupt instruction instruction set cause processor change privilege level also known
These detail covered later text book
Interrupts allow operating system take notice external event mouse click
Software interrupt better known exception allow OS handle unusual event like error coming code execution
The sequence event usually like The important interrupt operating system timer tick interrupt
The timer tic interrupt allows OS periodically regain control currently running user process
The OS decide schedule another process return back process housekeeping etc
The timer tick interrupt provides foundation concept preemptive multitasking
An interrupt unusual event happens need processed regardless whatever else going
I say unusual quote necessarily unexpected bad unusual point view CPU happen busy executing code may unrelated
The CPU mechanism listening interrupt way configuring interrupt various kind occur
This allows operating system arrange notified hardware device thing including hardware clock simply generates interrupt regular interval
Through CPU interrupt handling configuration designated code OS gain control whenever interrupt happen
The computer unpleasant state application programmer interrupt handler start running machine busy something else could OS notified something happened
It gather information needed actually handle interrupt wherever machine lying around whatever processing required without disturbing could anything running CPU
If OS want switch application process currently running save enough context able restore later without disturbing context load context let CPU resume normal execution context
As mentioned interrupt used getting notification hardware device alternative would periodically check keeping track time getting guaranteed opportunity regain control application process order switch application running recovering application process executing invalid instruction also enable application make request OS
These last known system call
To prevent application messing machine normally run machine user mode prevents application basically anything reading writing virtual memory already allocated
This mean else file asking memory accessing device etc application make system call basically leaving information want somewhere know OS look executing CPU instruction cause interrupt right kind
The OS see application trying determine whether carry request
This guarantee OS involved process attempt anything affect anything outside process way access policy enforced
So essentially yes OS driven interrupt
An abstract OS bootstrap machine normal operation state point hand control normal process
Under normal circumstance OS regain control handling interrupt since pretty much nothing interesting happens without interrupt OS basically control everything time
The operating system driven interrupt
This mean If process execute device service user respond operating system sit quietly waiting something happen
Events almost always signaled occurrence interrupt trap trap hardware interrupt generated invalid instruction given return control OS
An example invalid instruction program trying access another program memory space without permission

In signal emitted hardware software indicating event need immediate attention
An interrupt alert processor condition requiring interruption current code processor executing
The processor responds suspending current activity saving executing called interrupt service routine ISR deal event
This interruption temporary interrupt handler finish processor resume normal activity
There two type interrupt hardware interrupt software interrupt
used device communicate require attention
Internally hardware interrupt implemented using electronic alerting signal sent processor external device either part computer external
For example pressing key moving trigger hardware interrupt cause processor read keystroke mouse position
Unlike software type described hardware interrupt occur middle instruction execution requiring additional care programming
The act initiating hardware interrupt referred IRQ
A caused either exceptional condition processor special cause interrupt executed
The former often called used error event occurring program execution exceptional enough handled within program
For example exception thrown processor commanded divide number zero instruction error impossible
The operating system catch exception choose abort instruction
Software interrupt instruction function similarly used variety purpose request service like interrupt sent request reading writing data disk
Each interrupt interrupt handler
The number hardware interrupt limited number interrupt request IRQ line processor may hundred different software interrupt
Interrupts commonly used technique especially
Such system said
Interrupts similar difference signal used mediated kernel possibly via system call handled process interrupt mediated processor handled
The kernel may pas interrupt signal process caused typical example
Hardware interrupt introduced optimization eliminating unproductive waiting time waiting external event
They may implemented hardware distinct system control line may integrated memory subsystem
If implemented hardware interrupt controller circuit IBM PC PIC may connected interrupting device processor interrupt pin several source interrupt onto one two CPU line typically available
If implemented part interrupt mapped system memory
Interrupts categorized different type Processors typically internal allows software ignore external hardware interrupt set
Setting clearing mask may faster accessing interrupt mask register IMR PIC disabling interrupt device
In case architecture disabling enabling interrupt processor act however may actually slower
An interrupt leaf machine state called
Such interrupt four property An interrupt meet requirement called
The phenomenon overall system performance severely hindered excessive amount processing time spent handling interrupt called
A interrupt signaled maintaining interrupt line high low
A device wishing signal interrupt drive line active level high low hold level serviced
It cease asserting line CPU command otherwise handle condition caused signal interrupt
Typically processor sample interrupt input predefined time bus cycle state microprocessor
If interrupt active processor sample CPU see
One possible use type interrupt minimize spurious signal noisy interrupt line spurious pulse often short noticed
Multiple device may share interrupt line designed
The interrupt line must actively driven settle inactive state
Devices actively assert line indicate outstanding interrupt let line float actively drive signalling interrupt
The line asserted state one one sharing device signalling outstanding interrupt
interrupt favored easy share line without losing interrupt multiple shared device interrupt time
Upon detecting assertion interrupt line CPU must search device sharing line one triggered interrupt detected
After servicing device CPU may recheck interrupt line status determine whether device also need service
If line CPU avoids checking remaining device line
Since device interrupt frequently others device interrupt particularly expensive careful ordering device check employed increase efficiency
The original standard mandated interrupt advantage sharing interrupt
There also serious problem sharing interrupt
As long device line outstanding request service line remains asserted possible detect change status device
Deferring servicing device option would prevent detection service request device
If device line CPU know service interrupt device permanently block interrupt device
An interrupt signalled interrupt line either falling edge high low rising edge low high
A device wishing signal interrupt drive pulse onto line release line inactive state
If pulse short detected special hardware may required detect edge
Multiple device may share interrupt line designed
The interrupt line must resistor actively driven settle one particular state
Devices signal interrupt briefly driving line state let line float actively drive signalling interrupt
This type connection also referred
The line carry pulse generated device
This analogous bus trolley passenger pull signal driver requesting stop
However interrupt pulse different device may merge occur close time
To avoid losing interrupt CPU must trigger trailing edge pulse
rising edge line pulled driven low
After detecting interrupt CPU must check device service requirement
interrupt suffer problem interrupt sharing
Service device postponed arbitrarily interrupt continue received device serviced
If device CPU know service may cause spurious interrupt even periodic spurious interrupt interfere interrupt signalling device
However fairly easy edge triggered interrupt missed example interrupt masked period unless type hardware latch record event impossible recover
Such problem caused many lockup early computer hardware processor know expected something
More modern hardware often one interrupt status register latch interrupt request well written interrupt software often check register ensure event missed
The elderly ISA bus us interrupt mandate device able share
The also us interrupt
Many older device assume exclusive use interrupt line making electrically unsafe share
However ISA motherboards include resistor IRQ line device share ISA interrupt fine
Some system use hybrid signalling
The hardware look edge also verifies interrupt signal stay active certain period time
A common use hybrid interrupt NMI interrupt input
Because NMIs generally signal major even catastrophic system event good implementation signal try ensure interrupt valid verifying remains active period time
This approach help eliminate false interrupt affecting system
A use physical interrupt line
Instead device signal request service sending short message communication medium typically
The message might type reserved interrupt might type memory write
interrupt behave much like interrupt interrupt momentary signal rather continuous condition
software treat two much manner
Typically multiple pending interrupt message virtual interrupt line allowed merge closely spaced interrupt merge
shared extent underlying communication medium shared
No additional effort required
Because identity interrupt indicated pattern data bit requiring separate physical conductor many distinct interrupt efficiently handled
This reduces need sharing
Interrupt message also passed serial bus requiring additional line
serial computer bus us exclusively
In analogy applied term often used describe mechanism whereby system signal notify device work done
Typically software system place data mutually agreed upon memory location ring doorbell writing different memory location
This different memory location often called doorbell region may even multiple doorbell serving different purpose region
It act writing doorbell region memory ring bell notifies hardware device data ready waiting
The hardware device would know data valid acted upon
It would typically write data send etc
The term usually
It similar interrupt cause work done device however doorbell region sometimes implemented region sometimes doorbell region writes physical device sometimes doorbell region hardwired directly physical device register
When either writing directly physical device register may cause real interrupt occur device central processor unit one
Doorbell interrupt compared similarity
Multiple device sharing interrupt line triggering style act spurious interrupt source respect
With many device one line workload servicing interrupt grows proportion square number device
It therefore preferred spread device evenly across available interrupt line
Shortage interrupt line problem older system design interrupt line distinct physical conductor
interrupt interrupt line virtual favored new system architecture relieve problem considerable extent
Some device poorly designed programming interface provide way determine whether requested service
They may lock otherwise misbehave serviced want
Such device tolerate spurious interrupt also tolerate sharing interrupt line
card due often cheap design construction notorious problem
Such device becoming much rarer becomes cheaper new system architecture mandate shareable interrupt
Interrupts provide low overhead good low load degrade significantly high interrupt rate unless care taken prevent several pathology
These various form system spends time processing interrupt exclusion required task
Under extreme condition large number interrupt like high network traffic may completely stall system
To avoid problem must schedule network interrupt handling carefully schedule process execution
With processor additional performance improvement interrupt handling achieved RSS used
Such NICs provide multiple receive associated separate interrupt routing interrupt different core processing interrupt request triggered network traffic received single NIC distributed among multiple core
Distribution interrupt among core performed automatically operating system routing interrupt usually referred manually configured
A purely implementation receiving traffic distribution known RPS distributes received traffic among core later data path part functionality
Advantages RPS RSS include requirement specific hardware advanced traffic distribution filter reduced rate interrupt produced NIC
As downside RPS increase rate IPIs
RFS take approach accounting performance improvement achieved processing interrupt request core particular network packet consumed targeted application
Typical us interrupt include following system timer disk signal
Other interrupt exist transfer data byte using sense control motor anything else equipment must
Another typical use generate periodic interrupt dividing output crystal oscillator interrupt handler count interrupt order processor keep time
These periodic interrupt often used OS task reschedule priority running
Some older computer generated periodic interrupt controlled utility eliminate drift electric clock
For example disk interrupt signal completion data transfer disk peripheral process waiting read write file start
As another example interrupt predicts request loss power allowing computer equipment perform orderly
Also interrupt used feature buffering event like
Interrupts used allow emulation instruction unimplemented certain model computer line
For example instruction may implemented hardware system emulated system
Execution unimplemented instruction cause interrupt
The operating system interrupt handler recognize occurrence unimplemented instruction interpret instruction software routine return interrupting program instruction executed
This provides application software portability across entire line

A signal informing occurred
When program receives interrupt signal take specified action ignore signal
Interrupt signal cause program suspend temporarily service interrupt
Interrupt signal come variety source
For example every generates interrupt signal
Interrupts also generated indicate event occurred
These called Interrupt signal initiated program called

Can running interrupt handler another interrupt handler
If possible scenario safe scenario
If possible
This depends processor architecture kernel architecture
Generally speaking interrupt handler start interrupt disabled
This necessary interrupt handler room storage minimum interrupt handler need exclusive use register including program counter processor must save somewhere set banked register
On processor possible interrupt interrupted another interrupt
To give one example I familiar ARM processor IRQ normal interrupt FIQ fast interrupt
Each register bank program counter stack pointer interrupt vector
An IRQ handler start IRQ disabled FIQ enabled FIQ handler start IRQ FIQ disabled
Thus FIQ triggered middle handling IRQ
It operating system decide interrupt handler reenable interrupt priority interrupt different type priority
The longer interrupt blocked longer latency handle interrupt come soon another
In particular OS typically need reenable interrupt fast
To give couple example At point interrupt handler unmasks interrupt must ready cope must using resource another interrupt handler would thrash
Furthermore since interrupt handler finished job must mechanism program counter saved somewhere mechanic depends lot processor kernel architecture

What difference Trap Interrupt
If terminology different different system mean
A exception user process
It caused division zero invalid memory access
It also usual way invoke kernel routine run higher priority user code
Handling synchronous user code suspended continues afterwards
In sense active time code expects trap happen relies fact
An something generated hardware device like hard disk graphic card port etc
These asynchronous
happen predictable place user code passive since interrupt handler wait happen eventually
You also see trap kind interrupt since handler trap handler look like interrupt handler register stack pointer saved context switch execution resume case left
closely related
Traps type exception similar interrupt
Intel defines two overlapping category vectored event v exception class v v
All quote post April version
For definitive complex perspective I recommend reading SDM chapter Interrupt Exception handling
Vectored Events cause processor jump interrupt handler saving much processor state enough execution continue point later
Exceptions interrupt ID called vector determines interrupt handler processor jump
Interrupt handler described within Interrupt Descriptor Table
occur random time execution program response signal hardware
System hardware us interrupt handle event external processor request service peripheral device
Software also generate interrupt executing INT n instruction
occur processor detects error condition executing instruction division zero
The processor detects variety error condition including protection violation page fault internal machine fault
classified depending way reported whether instruction caused exception restarted without loss program task continuity
Summary increment instruction pointer
A exception reported immediately following execution trapping instruction
Traps allow execution program task continued without loss program continuity
The return address trap handler point instruction executed trapping instruction
A exception generally corrected corrected allows program restarted loss continuity
When fault reported processor restores machine state state prior beginning execution faulting instruction
The return address saved content CS EIP register fault handler point faulting instruction rather instruction following faulting instruction
Example A page fault often recoverable
A piece application address space may swapped disk ram
The application trigger page fault try access memory swapped
The kernel pull memory disk ram hand control back application
The application continue left faulting instruction accessing swapped memory time memory access succeed without faulting
An exception always report precise location instruction causing exception allow restart program task caused exception
Aborts used report severe error hardware error inconsistent illegal value system table
Software invoked interrupt triggered INT instruction behave manner
The instruction completes processor save state jump interrupt handler
Generally speaking term like exception fault abort mean thing called Interrupts
Coming difference Trap Interrupt Trap Is programmer initiated expected transfer control special handler routine
For ex instruction good example Where Interrupt Hardware Is program control interruption based external hardware event external CPU For ex Pressing key keyboard time timer chip A special kind commonly referred
An general term cover interrupt hardware device interrupt software
A trap called code like program used call OS routine normally synchronous
An interrupt called event many time hardware like network card received data CPU timer name suggests interrupt normal control flow CPU switch driver routine handle event
An interrupt within system
An interrupt handler summoned deal cause interrupt control returned interrupted context instruction
A trap interrupt
An interrupt used signal completion obviate need device polling
A trap used call operating system routine catch arithmetic error
I think Traps caused execution current instruction thus called synchronous event
interrupt caused independent instruction running processor related external event thus known asynchronous one
Interrupts hardware interrupt trap interrupt
Occurrences hardware interrupt usually disable hardware interrupt true trap
If need disallow hardware interrupt trap served need explicitly clear interrupt flag
And usually interrupt flag computer affect hardware interrupt opposed trap
This mean clearing flag prevent trap
Unlike trap interrupt preserve previous state CPU
A trap software write program declare variable divide zero value treated run program throw error call special version trap program asks o required service
In case interrupt general word hardware interrupt like error cpu interrupted random time course fault hardware brings

operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Τhis sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

In special used control behaviour
In fact generator
A generator similar function return array generator parameter called generates sequence value
However instead building array containing value returning generator yield value one time requires le memory allows caller get started processing first value immediately
In short generator function
Generators implemented term expressive construct
Generators also known semicoroutines special case weaker coroutines always yield control back caller passing value back rather specifying coroutine jump see
Generators usually inside loop
The first time generator invocation reached loop iterator created encapsulates state generator routine beginning argument bound corresponding
The generator body executed context iterator special action encountered time value provided action used value invocation expression
The next time generator invocation reached subsequent iteration execution generator body resumed action yet another action encountered
In addition action execution generator body also terminated action time innermost loop enclosing generator invocation terminated
In complicated situation generator may used manually outside loop create iterator used various way
Because generator compute yielded value demand useful representing sequence would expensive impossible compute
These include
infinite sequence live data stream
When eager evaluation desirable primarily sequence finite otherwise evaluation never terminate one either convert use parallel construction creates list instead generator
For example Python generator evaluated list via F evaluates lazily generator sequence evaluates eagerly list
In presence generator loop construct language reduced single loop end loop construct usual loop construct comfortably simulated using suitable generator right way
For example ranged loop like implemented iteration generator Python
Further implemented sending generator using loop
Generators first appeared prominent feature string manipulation language available later version ECMAScript language
In CLU C generator called Ruby
The final standard natively provide generator yet various library implementation exist documented
A yield statement used implement iterators data abstraction
Every expression including loop generator
The language many generator even implement logic semantics using generator mechanism OR done way
Printing square achieved using writing However time custom generator implemented suspend keyword function exactly like yield keyword CLU
As Icon every expression generator
The infinite generator prime serve example It possible introduce generator using macro
The resulting code might aspect different native
generator syntax uncluttered
A good example found
The set macro defined source allow generator defined syntax following example This iterated using Moreover allows applied class provides function
It possible write class defining iterable method iterator method class
For example possible write following program A basic range implementation would look like Perl natively provide generator support provided module us framework
Example usage In generator mechanism founded named
In model everything generator every datum created data constructor generated demand
For example list constructor operator used parenthesization
This us standard adaptor function value agreeable predicate stop requesting new value soon one encountered
The shared storage access used universal mediator Haskell
List comprehension freely used provides several related facility generator
First form work kind producer sequence also value Some sequence implemented imperatively private state variable implemented possibly infinite lazy list
Also new struct definition property specifies used sequence
But directly Racket come generator library traditional generator specification
For example Note Racket core implement powerful continuation feature providing general continuation composable also delimited continuation
Using generator library implemented Racket
The community PHP implemented generator PHP
Details found original
Ruby support generator starting version form Enumerator class
Java standard interface implementing iterators since early day since Java foreach construction make easy loop object provide interface
The collection framework typically provide iterators collection
However generator built language
This mean creating iterators often much trickier language generator especially generation logic complex
Because state must saved restored every time item yielded iterator possible store state local variable use looping routine generator available instead must manually simulated using object field hold local state loop counter
Even simple iterators built way tend significantly bulkier using generator lot
The original example could written An infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written int Iterator Also infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written using Stream interface Or get Iterator BaseStream Stream interface
An example C generator available since C version Both example utilise Generics required
It possible use multiple statement applied sequence iteration In iterators basis loop provides generator via since version
These define sequence lazily evaluated sequential access via list eagerly evaluated sequential access via array eagerly evaluated indexed access via contain code generates value
For example form sequence square number filtering number range number
Generators added version
An example generator In Python generator thought contains frozen
Whenever iterator method called Python resume frozen frame executes normally next statement reached
The generator frame frozen yielded value returned caller
PEP implemented Python add expression allowing generator delegate part operation another generator
Python syntax modeled called generator expression aid creation generator
The following extends example using generator expression compute square countfrom generator function
Harmony feature generator function
An infinite Fibonacci sequence written using function generator The iterators package used purpose

Computer Science facing major roadblock research
The problem evident student afflicts many researcher well people simply tough time inventing research topic sound sufficiently profound exciting
Many PhD student waste needle year simply coming thesis topic
And researcher often resort reading document government grant agency know work next proposal
Good news CS community problem last solved
The table provides answer
To generate technical phrase randomly choose one item column
For example selecting column column column produce

A test data generator specialized software tool generates false mock data use testing software application
The generated data may either random specifically chosen create desired result
A test data generator commonly used testing database database management software DBMS system generally require large amount data sort store limit reached
A test data generator used create either random data structured formatted data
Structured data generally useful database system often save data table column contain specific type information random data suited purpose
Test data generator follow specific procedure Once path testing determined test data generator generates data result execution selected path aim creating data meant traverse path chosen path selector
This done mathematical modeling
There different kind test data generator Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

data specifically identified use test typically computer program
Some data may used confirmatory way typically verify given set input given function produce expected result
Other data may used order challenge ability program respond unusual extreme exceptional unexpected input
Test data may produced focused systematic way typically case domain testing using approach typically case randomized automated test
Test data may produced tester program function aid tester
Test data may recorded used forgotten
It always possible produce enough data testing
The amount data tested determined limited consideration time cost quality
Time produce cost produce quality test data efficiency
Domain testing family test technique focus test data
This might include identifying common critical input representative particular equivalence class model value might appear boundary one equivalence class another outrageous value rejected program combination input input might drive product towards particular set output
Software testing important part Software Development Life Cycle today

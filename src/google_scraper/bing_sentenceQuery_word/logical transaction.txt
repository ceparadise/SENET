cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

Can someone provide straightforward simpler possible explanation transaction applied computing even copied Wikipedia
A transaction unit work want treat whole
It either happen full
A classical example transferring money one bank account another
To first withdraw amount source account deposit destination account
The operation succeed full
If stop halfway money lost Very Bad
In modern database transaction also thing like ensure ca access data another person written halfway
But basic idea transaction ensure
They guarantee NOT situation money withdrawn one account deposited another
A transaction way representing state change
Transactions ideally four property commonly known ACID See Wikipedia entry detail
Although typically applied database
In particular see
A series data manipulation statement must either fully complete fully fail leaving database consistent state Here simple explanation
You need transfer buck account A account B
You either If something go wrong first second operation pair problem either buck disappeared appeared nowhere
A transaction mechanism allows mark group operation execute way either execute commit system state started execute rollback
either transfer buck leave account initial state
A transaction sequence one SQL operation treated unit
Specifically transaction appears run isolation furthermore system fails transaction either executed entirety
The concept transaction motivated two completely independent concern
One concurrent access database multiple client system resilient system failure
Transaction support known ACID property Properties Transactions Transactions following four standard property usually referred acronym ACID Transaction Control There following command used control transaction ACID tomicity onsistency solation urability When wish multiple transactional resource involved single transaction need use something like solution
quite widely supported
I would suggest definition processing would useful cover transaction concept computer science
From wikipedia In computer science transaction processing information processing divided individual indivisible operation called transaction
Each transaction must succeed fail complete unit remain intermediate state
In addition response noted least theory restriction whatsoever kind resource involved transaction
Most time database multiple distinct database also conceivable printer take part transaction cause transaction fail say event paper jam
I think transaction atomic action term DBMS
mean seperated
yes transction may several instruction system execute
binded together finished single basic task
example
need walk bridge let treat transction say need step
overall step seperated
done half two choice continue finish go back start point
like result transaction success committed fail rollback Transaction indivisible unit data processing transaction must ACID property ie Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durable Transaction nothing intermidiate mean transfer money one account another account one account lose much one gain amount transfer money one account another account still empty transaction Transaction defined collection task considered minimum processing unit
Each minimum processing unit divided
The main operation transaction read write
All transaction must contain four property commonly known ACID property purpose ensuring accuracy completeness data integrity
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

A plural simply mathematical
It exactly one finite number given time
The FSM change one state another response external change one state another called
An FSM defined list state initial state condition transition
The behavior state machine observed many device modern society perform predetermined sequence action depending sequence event presented
Examples dispense product proper combination coin deposited whose sequence stop determined floor requested rider change sequence car waiting require input combination number proper order
The finite state machine le computational power model computation
The computational power distinction mean computational task Turing machine FSM
This FSM limited number state
FSMs studied general field
An example simple mechanism modeled state machine
A turnstile used control access subway amusement park ride gate three rotating arm waist height one across entryway
Initially arm locked blocking entry preventing patron passing
Depositing coin slot turnstile unlocks arm allowing single customer push
After customer pass arm locked another coin inserted
Considered state machine turnstile two possible state
There two possible input affect state putting coin slot pushing arm
In locked state pushing arm effect matter many time input given stay locked state
Putting coin giving machine input shift state
In unlocked state putting additional coin effect giving additional input change state
However customer pushing arm giving input shift state back
The turnstile state machine represented showing possible state transition based upon input given machine output resulting input The turnstile state machine also represented called
Each state represented
Edges show transition one state another
Each arrow labeled input trigger transition
An input cause change state input state represented circular arrow returning original state
The arrow node black dot indicates initial state
A description status system waiting execute
A transition set action executed condition fulfilled event received
For example using audio system listen radio system radio state receiving next stimulus result moving next station
When system CD state next stimulus result moving next track
Identical stimulus trigger different action depending current state
In machine representation also possible associate action state Several type used
The common representation shown combination current state
B input
Y show next state
C

The standard includes graphical symbol describe action transition SDL embeds basic data type called Abstract Data Types action language execution semantic order make finite state machine executable
There large number variant represent FSM one figure
In addition use modeling reactive system presented finite state machine significant many different area including
Finite state machine class automaton studied
In computer science finite state machine widely used modeling application behavior design study computation language
Finite state machine subdivided transducer acceptor classifier sequencer
also called produce binary output indicating whether received input accepted
Each state FSM either accepting accepting
Once input received current state accepting state input accepted otherwise rejected
As rule input character action used
The example figure show finite state machine accepts string nice
In FSM accepting state state
A possibly infinite set symbol sequence aka
formal language called Finite State Machine accepts exactly set
For example set binary string even number zero regular language cf
Fig
set string whose length prime number
A machine could also described defining language would contain every string accepted machine none rejected one language accepted machine
By definition language accepted FSMs language regular FSM accepts
The problem determining language accepted given finite state acceptor instance generalization graph edge weighted element arbitrary
The start state also accepting state case automaton accepts empty string
An example accepting state appears DFA detects whether input string contains even number
also start state indicates state even number input
S therefore accepting state
This machine finish accept state binary string contains even number including binary string containing
Examples string accepted DFA etc
A generalization finite state machine similar acceptor produce single output termination two terminal state
generate output based given input state using action
They used control application field
In control application two type distinguished subclass acceptor transducer type
They produce one sequence seen output sequence acceptor transducer output
A distinction automaton
In deterministic automaton every state exactly one transition possible input
In automaton input lead one one transition given state
The algorithm transform nondeterministic automaton usually complex deterministic automaton identical functionality
A finite state machine one state called combinatorial FSM
It allows action upon transition state
This concept useful case number finite state machine required work together convenient consider purely combinatorial part form FSM suit design tool
There set semantics available represent state machine
For example tool modeling designing logic embedded controller
They combine usually one current state flow graph one language resulting different formalism set semantics
These chart like Harel original state machine support hierarchically nested state state action transition action
In accordance general classification following formal definition found For deterministic FSMs conventional allow
defined every combination
If FSM state next symbol defined announce error
reject input
This useful definition general state machine le useful transforming machine
Some algorithm default form may require total function
A finite state machine computational power restricted head may perform read operation always move left right
That formal language accepted finite state machine accepted kind restricted Turing machine vice versa
If output function function state input alphabet definition corresponds modelled
If output function depends state definition corresponds modelled
A machine output function known
If disregard first output symbol Moore machine readily converted Mealy machine setting output function every Mealy transition
labeling every edge output symbol given destination Moore state
The converse transformation le straightforward Mealy machine state may different output label incoming transition edge
Every state need split multiple Moore machine state one every incident output symbol

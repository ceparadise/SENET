In general practice performed determine performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify system resource usage
Performance testing subset practice strives build performance standard implementation design architecture system
simplest form performance testing
A load test usually conducted understand behaviour system specific expected load
This load expected concurrent number user performing specific number within set duration
This test give response time important business critical transaction
The etc
also monitored test assist identifying application software hardware software installed
normally used understand upper limit capacity within system
This kind test done determine system robustness term extreme load help application administrator determine system perform sufficiently current load go well expected maximum
also known endurance testing usually done determine system sustain continuous expected load
During soak test memory utilization monitored detect potential leak
Also important often overlooked performance degradation
ensure throughput response time long period sustained activity good better beginning test
It essentially involves applying significant load system extended significant period time
The goal discover system behaves sustained use
Spike testing done suddenly increasing decreasing load generated large number user observing behaviour system
The goal determine whether performance suffer system fail able handle dramatic change load
Rather testing performance load perspective test created determine effect configuration change system component system performance behaviour
A common example would experimenting different method
Isolation testing unique performance testing involves repeating test execution resulted system problem
Such testing often isolate confirm fault domain
This relatively new form performance testing global application Facebook Google Wikipedia performance tested load generator placed actual target continent whether physical machine cloud VMs
These test usually requires immense amount preparation monitoring executed successfully
Performance testing serve different purpose Many performance test undertaken without setting sufficiently realistic performance goal
The first question business perspective always
These consideration part testing
Performance goal differ depending system technology purpose always include following If system identifies form procedure concurrency goal highly desirable
By definition largest number concurrent system user system expected support given moment
The scripted transaction may impact true especially iterative part contains activity
If system concept performance goal likely based maximum throughput transaction rate
This refers time taken one system node respond request another
A simple example would HTTP request browser client web server
In term response time tool actually measure
It may relevant set server response time goal node system
tool difficulty measuring time since generally concept happens within apart recognizing period time activity wire
To measure render response time generally necessary include functional part performance test scenario
Many load testing tool offer feature
It critical detail performance specification requirement document performance test plan
Ideally done requirement development phase system development project prior design effort
See detail
However performance testing frequently performed specification one expressed maximum acceptable response time given population user
Performance testing frequently used part process performance profile tuning
The idea identify weakest link inevitably part system made respond faster result overall system running faster
It sometimes difficult task identify part system represents critical path test tool include provide instrumentation run server agent report transaction time database access time network overhead server monitor analyzed together raw performance statistic
Without instrumentation one might someone crouched server see much CPU load performance test generating assuming Windows system test
Performance testing performed across web even done different part country since known response time internet vary regionally
It also done although would need configured introduce lag would typically occur public network
Loads introduced system realistic point
For example system user base accessing system via modem connection half load injector computer simulate real user either inject load mix connection ideal simulate network latency connection following user profile
It always helpful statement likely peak number user might expected use system peak time
If also statement constitutes maximum allowable percentile response time injector configuration could used test whether proposed system met specification
Performance specification ask following question minimum A stable build system must resemble production environment closely possible
To ensure consistent result performance testing environment isolated environment UAT development
As best practice always advisable separate performance testing environment resembling production environment much possible
In performance testing often crucial test condition similar expected actual use
However practice hard arrange wholly possible since production system subjected unpredictable workload
Test workload may mimic occurrence production environment far possible simplest system one exactly replicate workload variability
architectural implementation
created additional complexity performance testing
To truly replicate state enterprise service asset share common platform require coordinated performance testing consumer creating transaction volume load shared infrastructure platform
Because activity complex costly money time organization use tool monitor simulate condition also referred noise performance testing environment understand capacity resource requirement verify validate quality attribute
It critical cost performance new system performance test effort begin inception development project extend deployment
The later performance defect detected higher cost remediation
This true case functional testing even performance testing due nature scope
It crucial performance test team involved early possible acquire prepare testing environment key performance requisite
Performance testing mainly divided two main category This part performance testing mainly deal work flow key identified business process
This done using wide variety tool like
Each tool mentioned list exhaustive complete either employ scripting language C Java JS form visual representation drag drop create simulate end user work flow
Most tool allow something called Record Replay performance tester launch testing tool hook browser thick client capture network transaction happen client server
In script developed emulate various business scenario This form face performance testing
With performance monitoring behaviour response characteristic application test observed
The parameter usually monitored performance test execution Server hardware Parameters As first step pattern generated parameter provide good indication bottleneck lie
To determine exact root cause issue use tool measure part device software contribute poor performance establish throughput level threshold maintained acceptable response time
Performance testing technology employ one PCs Unix server act injector emulating presence number user running automated sequence interaction recorded script series script emulate different type user interaction host whose performance tested
Usually separate PC act test conductor coordinating gathering metric injector collating performance data reporting purpose
The usual sequence ramp load start virtual user increase number time predetermined maximum
The test result show performance varies load given number user response time
Various tool available perform test
Tools category usually execute suite test emulate real user system
Sometimes result reveal oddity average response time might acceptable outlier key transaction take considerably longer complete something might caused inefficient database query picture etc
Performance testing combined order see happens acceptable load exceeded
Does system crash
How long take recover large load reduced
Does failure cause collateral damage
method model behaviour system spreadsheet
The model fed measurement transaction resource demand disk weighted business transaction per hour
The weighted transaction resource demand added obtain hourly resource demand divided hourly resource capacity obtain resource load
Using responsetime formula responsetimes calculated calibrated result performance test
Analytical performance modeling allows evaluation design option system sizing based actual anticipated business use
It therefore much faster cheaper performance testing though requires thorough understanding hardware platform
Tasks perform test would include According Microsoft Developer Network Performance Testing Methodology consists following activity

amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design

Accurate data collection essential maintaining integrity research making informed business decision ensuring
For example retail sale data might collected website visit online survey learn customer
In project data collection would include physical server also exact description installed operating system application server support
Surveys interview focus group primary instrument collecting information
Today help Web analytics tool organization also able collect data mobile device website traffic server activity relevant source depending project
Big data describes voluminous amount collected organization
But take lot time money load traditional analysis new approach collecting analyzing data emerged
To gather information raw data extended aggregated
From artificial intelligence program use complex look repeatable pattern
Generally two type data quantitative data qualitative data
data data numerical form statistic percentage
Qualitative data descriptive data color smell appearance quality
In addition quantitative qualitative data organization might also make use secondary data help drive business decision
Secondary data typically quantitative nature already collected another party different purpose
For example company might use Census data make

In grouping variable number data item possibly zero shared significance problem solved need operated upon together controlled fashion
Generally data item type language supporting inheritance derived common ancestor type
A collection concept applicable prescribe specific implementation concrete though often conventional choice see discussion
Examples collection include
array table usually considered collection hold fixed number data item although commonly play role implementation collection
array generally considered collection
Many collection define particular linear ordering access one end
The actual data structure implementing collection need example priority queue often implemented kind tree
Important linear collection include In list order data item significant
Duplicate data item permitted
Examples operation list searching data item list determining location present removing data item list adding data item list specific location etc
If principal operation list addition data item one end removal data item generally called
If principal operation addition removal data item one end called
In case data item maintained within collection order unless removed somewhere else special case list collection
Other specialized operation list include sorting order data item great importance
A stack LIFO data structure two principal operation add element top collection remove top element
In priority queue track minimum maximum data item collection kept according ordering criterion order data item matter
One may think priority queue list always keep minimum maximum head remaining element kept bag
Other collection instead interpreted sort function given input collection yield output
Important associative collection include A set interpreted specialized multiset turn specialized associative array case limiting possible set represented
In set order data item matter undefined duplicate data item permitted
Examples operation set addition removal data item searching data item set
Some language support set directly
In others set implemented dummy value key used representing set
In multiset bag like set order data item matter case duplicate data item permitted
Examples operation multisets addition removal data item determining many duplicate particular data item present multiset
Multisets transformed list action sorting
In associative array map dictionary lookup table like dictionary lookup like word provides like definition
The value might reference compound data structure
A usually efficient implementation thus data type often known hash
In graph data item association one data item collection somewhat like tree without concept data item peer
Examples operation graph traversal search explore association data item looking specific property
Graphs frequently used model situation solve related problem
An example creates graph mesh representation data network figure association switching node need broken turn tree thus prevent data going around loop
In tree special kind graph data item associated number data item turn associated number data item frequently viewed
Every data item root single parent root parent number child possibly zero
Examples operation tree addition data item maintain specific property tree perform sorting etc
traversal visit data item specific sequence
Tree collection used naturally store hierarchical data presented manner menu system file directory data storage system
Specialized tree used various algorithm
For example us kind tree called
As described collection various kind collection abstract concept
There exists literature considerable confusion abstract concept computer science specific implementation various language kind language
Assertions collection list set tree etc
data structure abstract data type class must read mind
Collections first foremost abstraction useful formulating solution computing problem
Viewed light retain important link underlying mathematical concept lost focus implementation
For example priority queue often implemented heap associative array often implemented hash table abstract type often referred preferred implementation heap hash though strictly correct
Some collection may language list complex collection implemented library sometimes

Data Collection important aspect type research study
Inaccurate data collection impact result study ultimately lead invalid result
Data collection method impact evaluation vary along continuum
At one end continuum quantatative method end continuum Qualitative method data collection
http The rely random sampling structured data collection instrument fit diverse experience predetermined response category
They produce result easy summarize compare generalize
In Quantitative research survey research interview structured Qualitative research
In structured interview researcher asks standard set question nothing
Leedy Ormrod distinct advantage enabling researcher establish rapport potential partiocipants therefor gain interview yield highest response rate survey also allow researcher clarify ambiguous answer appropriate seek information
Disadvantages include impractical large sample involved time consuming expensive
Leedy Ormrod le time consuming le expensive researcher ready access anyone planet hasa response rate high face interview cosiderably higher mailed sample may biased extent people without phone part population researcher want draw inference
form personal interviewing instead completing questionnaire interviewer brings along laptop computer enter information directly database
This method save time involved processing data well saving interviewer carrying around hundred questionnaire
However type data collection method expensive set requires interviewer computer typing skill
sent large number people save researcher time truthful responding questionnaire regarding controversial issue particular due fact response anonymous
But also people receive questionnaire return might representative originally selected sample
Leedy Ormrod A new inevitably growing methodology use Internet based research
This would mean receiving would click address would take secure fill questionnaire
This type research often quicker le disadvantage method include exclusion people computer unable access validity survey question people might hurry complete might give accurate response
http Questionnaires often make use Checklist rating device help simplify quantify people behavior list behavior characteristic entity te researcher looking researcher survey participant simply check whether item list observed present true vice useful behavior need evaluated also known Likert scale
Leedy Ormrod play important role impact evaluation providing information useful understand process behind observed result ass change perception qualitative method beused improve quality quantitative evaluation helping generate evaluation hypothesis strengthening design survey questionnaire expanding clarifying quantitative evaluation finding
These method characterized following attribute Regardless kind data involved data collection qualitative study take great deal researcher need record potentially useful data thououghly accurately systematically using field note sketch audiotape photograph suitable data collection method must observe ethical principle research
The qualitative method commonly used evaluation classified three broad category The following link provides information three method
Different way collecting evaluation data useful different purpose advantage disadvantage
Various factor influence choice data collection method question want investigate resource available timeline


also called collection data specially organized rapid search retrieval
Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary
early adopter computer database technology
In United States National Crime Information Center NCIC established police record subsequently computerized made available police agency throughout country
The NCIC database enables local police department apprehend offender might otherwise evade advent database marketing individual customer characteristic purchase history retained company information system
Even company particularly large retailer catalog house compile comprehensive data individual customer able customize offering communication

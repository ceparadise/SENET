I read leverage created tranche CDS index junior tranche risk index
I get junior tranche risk I see leverage created controlling le
The leverage conceptual borrowing something buy something standard form leverage
I think become clear compare equity tranche position position underlying index
An equity tranche CDX IG would incur loss one constituent underlying index default
There name index representing basket

The underlying index would suffer loss
This risk asymmetry spread equity tranche move multiple move underlying index called tranche delta
Let say multiple want short IG exposure
I buy protection IG equity tranche instead IG index receive similar economic exposure obviously lot basis risk
That leverage
Without seeing source I say sure thinking way
You sell CDS index buy junior tranche proceeds selling index used pay junior
note possible special account Say
If sell worth index play courtesy buyer gave minus
Your account value minus margin
You take use buy junior included index
And use
position start
Leverage
Of course one must margin available run naked short practically anything

We familiar lever
It help multiply strength user called leverage enabling move much heavier object normally could
Most u probably even played lever form
Like physical lever applies leverage multiply strength user multiplies company financial strength regard common stockholder allowing provide stockholder larger return could without leverage
Besides common equity common stock retained earnings company use debt preferred stock lease finance asset
These three additional financing source tend fixed cost lower earnings company receives asset
As result lever return common stockholder investment upward
Let look example action
Rick Boswell decides open business investing money
In first year business earns tax
The business pay tax add leaf Rick net income return investment
In second year company take debt us money buy back worth Rick equity
Again company earns paying tax pay interest debt
This leaf taxable income net income
The company return investment Rick return equity investment
In finance common round two decimal place would say
Notice even though company return lower Rick higher
In third year business sell worth preferred stock using proceeds buy back Rick stock
Everything remains second year except preferred dividend must paid net income leaving Rick
However Rick investment provides return investment
Finally fourth year business lease worth asset year paying interest included year allowing Rick take business exchange
There interest lease reducing taxable income net income leaving Rick return investment
You may noticed interest debt lease deducted tax dividend paid preferred stockholder deducted tax
This important point remember evaluating financial leverage interest tax deductible dividend
This make real tax cost debt lease lower stated cost

Now seen financial leverage work let simplify little
As remember example company asset total investment four year Rick investment equity went way
The fast way find return common stockholder know net return asset net income available common stockholder divided total asset total asset total common equity
This allows calculate use equity multiplier
The total asset divided total common equity
In first year Rick equity multiplier return investment company return investment
In second year Rick equity decreased giving equity multiplier
The company earned return investment Rick earned return normal rounding investment
Notice arrived time simply multiplying company return investment equity multiplier
Will work
In third year Rick equity multiplier company return investment Rick return investment
Just fun also fourth year
Equity multiplier company return investment Rick return investment
It work every time
If plan use analysis financial leverage help make investment decision also want benchmark company result least return investment equity multiplier industry operate
A good way find newest copy Dun Bradstreet look company industry
The data find include anything could want know industry quickly compare company industry see better worse average
You use knowledge decide return expect receive worth risk asked take
generally good thing company take much debt preferred stock lease financing increase risk stakeholder must accept
And return demand higher return investment resulting diminishing return common stockholder
The total asset divided total common equity used determine return investment

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

As startup CEOs keep mind distinction coding vocational training knowledge

In particular interactive information interchange also known dialogue conversation meeting two communicating device computer user see
A session set established certain point time torn later point
An established communication session may involve one message direction
A session typically always meaning least one communicating part need save information session history order able communicate opposed communication communication consists independent request response
An established session basic requirement perform
A session also basic step transmit mode
However unidirectional transmission define session
may implemented part protocol service
In case transport protocol implement formal session layer session application layer generally HTTP session maintained higher level program using method defined data exchanged
For example HTTP exchange browser remote host may include identifies state unique information user preference authorization level
thought allow single request response one Session
Protocol version improved completing CGI making easier maintain Web Session supporting file uploads
Most session maintained transport layer single connection single session
However transaction phase session creates separate connection
Maintaining session continuity phase requires
The embedded within A HREF FORM link passed back CGI
CGI us ensure session continuity transaction phase
One advantage one work well low bandwidth modem connection
TCP session typically implemented software using new process thread created computer establishes join session
HTTP session typically implemented using one thread per session mean database information state session
The advantage multiple process thread relaxed complexity software since thread history encapsulated variable
The disadvantage large overhead term system resource session may interrupted system restarted
When client may connect server cluster server special problem encountered maintaining consistency server must maintain session state
The client must either directed server duration session server must transmit session information via shared file system database
Otherwise client may reconnect different server one started session cause problem new server access stored state old one
session handy efficient become difficult handle conjunction system usable embedded system storage
The problem solved using shared storage applying forced peering client single server cluster although compromise system efficiency load distribution
A method using session system without reserve portion RAM storage session data
This method applicable server limited number client
router access point infrequent disallowed access one client time
session use cooky cryptographic technique maintain state without storing much data server
When presenting dynamic web page server sends current state data client web browser form cookie
The client save cookie memory disk
With successive request client sends cookie back server server us data remember state application specific client generate appropriate response
This mechanism may work well context however data stored client vulnerable tampering user software access client computer
To use session confidentiality integrity required following must guaranteed To accomplish server need encrypt session data sending client modification information party prevented via cryptographic mean
Transmitting state back forth every request practical size cookie small
In essence session trade server disk space extra bandwidth web request require
Moreover web browser limit number size cooky may stored web site
To improve efficiency allow session data server may compress data creating cookie decompressing later cookie returned client
A session token unique identifier generated sent identify current interaction session
The client usually store sends token sends parameter GET POST query
The reason use session token client handle session data stored server usually client direct access linked identifier
Examples name programming language use naming HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID PHPSESSID CGISESSID ASPSESSIONID
In process keeping track user activity across session interaction
Typical session management task include keeping track application open document application opened state restored user log log later
For website session management might involve requiring user session expired certain time limit passed without user activity
It also used store information HTTP request
A desktop session manager program save restore desktop session
A desktop session window currently running current content
Session management system provided
On system session management provided Session Manager Subsystem user session functionality extended application like
Session management particularly useful user save open page setting restore later date
To help recover system application crash page setting also restored next run
example web browser support session management
Session management often managed application
HTTP stateless client computer running web browser must establish new TCP network connection web server new HTTP GET POST request
The web server therefore rely established TCP network connection longer single HTTP GET POST operation
Session management technique used web developer make stateless HTTP protocol support session state
For example user authenticated web server user next HTTP request GET POST cause web server ask user account password
For discussion method used accomplish see In situation multiple web server must share knowledge session state typical environment session information must shared cluster node running web server software
Methods sharing session state node cluster include multicasting session information member node see one example technique sharing session information partner node using sharing session information node using network socket storing session information shared file system storing session information outside cluster
If session information considered transient volatile data required transaction contain data subject compliance auditing example see example two law necessitate compliance auditing method storing session information used
However session information subject audit compliance consideration given method used session storage replication clustering
In Simple Object Access Protocol message constructed Extensible Markup Language message used consumer application cause web server create session
Just HTTP stateless protocol
As SMS became interoperable across rival network text messaging started ascent towards becoming ubiquitous global form communication various enterprise became interested using SMS channel commercial purpose
Initial service require session management since communication example
Today application referred distinct messaging
The development interactive enterprise application required session management SMS stateless protocol defined GSM standard early implementation controlled enter command service identifier manually

Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Still question
Ask

learn share knowledge build career
I sometimes talking example managed code unmanaged code I idea difference
What difference definition
What consequence using either
Does distinction exist
Managed code Visual Basic C compiler create
It run CLR Common Language Runtime among thing offer service like garbage collection type checking reference checking
So think My code CLR
Visual Basic C produce managed code writing application one language writing application managed CLR
If writing application Visual produce managed code like optional
Unmanaged code compiles straight machine code
So definition code compiled traditional compiler code
Also since compiles machine code intermediate language
No free memory management anything else CLR provides
Since create unmanaged code Visual Basic C Visual Studio unmanaged code written
Since Visual compiled either managed unmanaged code possible mix two application
This blur line two complicates definition worth mentioning know still memory leak example using third party library badly written unmanaged code
Here example I found This general Windows
Managed environment automatic memory management garbage collection type safety unmanaged everything else
So example managed environment unmanaged
Managed code differentiation coined Microsoft identify computer program code requires execute management Common Language Runtime virtual machine resulting Bytecode
Managed code code written target service managed runtime execution environment Common Language Runtime Technology
The Managed Code running Common Language Runtime accessed outside runtime environment well call directly outside runtime environment
It refers contract cooperation natively executing code runtime
It offer service like garbage collection type checking reference checking etc
By using managed code avoid many typical programming mistake lead security hole unstable application also many unproductive programming task automatically taken care type safety checking memory management destruction unused Objects etc
What Unmanaged Code
Unmanaged code compiles straight machine code directly executed Operating System
The generated code run natively host processor processor directly executes code generated compiler
It always compiled target specific architecture run intended platform
So want run code different architecture recompile code using particular architecture
Unmanaged executable file basically binary image code directly loaded memory
This approach typically result fastest code execution diagnosing recovery error might difficult time consuming case
The memory allocation type safety security etc need taken care programmer lead unmanaged code prone memory leak like buffer overrun pointer override etc
All code compiled traditional compiler Unmanaged Code
COM component ActiveX interface API function example unmanaged code
Managed code code written many programming language available use Microsoft Framework including C J etc
Since Visual compiled either managed unmanaged code possible mix two application

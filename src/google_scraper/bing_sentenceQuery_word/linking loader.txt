In collection used often
These may include configuration data documentation help data message template specification
In referred
A also collection implementation behavior written term language interface behavior invoked
For instance people want write higher level program use library make instead implementing system call
In addition behavior provided reuse multiple independent program
A program invokes behavior via mechanism language
For example simple C behavior library invoked using C normal
What distinguishes call library function versus another function program way code organized system
Library code organized way used multiple program connection code part program organized used within one program
This distinction gain hierarchical notion program grows large program
In case may internal library reused independent large program
The distinguishing feature library organized purpose reused independent program user need know interface internal detail library
The value library lie reuse behavior
When program invokes library gain behavior implemented inside library without implement behavior
Libraries encourage sharing code fashion ease distribution code
The behavior implemented library connected invoking program different
If code library accessed build invoking program library called
An alternative build executable invoking program distribute independently library implementation
The library behavior connected executable invoked executed either part process starting execution middle execution
In case library called loaded
A dynamic library loaded linked preparing program execution
Alternatively middle execution application may explicitly request module
Most although programmer also create custom library
Most modern provide library implement majority system service
Such library service modern application requires
As code used modern application provided system library
The earliest programming concept analogous library intended separate definition program
brought COMPOOL Communication Pool concept popular attention although adopted idea software
Following computer science principle Comm Pool purpose permit sharing System Data among many program providing centralized data description
also included primitive capability library system described inadequate library facility retrospect
Another major contributor modern library concept came form innovation
FORTRAN subprogram compiled independently compiler lacked
So prior introduction module FORTRAN subprogram impossible
Finally historian concept remember influential
Simula first language nearly identical modern concept used
The concept Simula also progenitor
Even developed originally Simula class could included library file added compile time
Libraries important program process resolve reference known library module
The linking process usually automatically done program search set library module given order
Usually considered error link target found multiple time given set library
Linking may done executable file created whenever program used
The reference resolved may address jump routine call
They may main program one module depending upon another
They resolved fixed relocatable address common base allocating runtime memory module referenced
Some programming language may use feature called whereby linker aware integrated compiler linker know external reference used code library never actually even though internally referenced discarded compiled application
For example program us integer arithmetic arithmetic operation exclude library routine
This feature lead smaller application file size reduced memory usage
Some reference program library module stored relative symbolic form resolved code library assigned final static address
process adjusting reference done either linker
In general relocation done individual library address memory may vary depending program using library combined
avoids reference absolute address therefore require relocation
When linking performed creation executable another object file known
In case linking usually done may also done
A also known one intended statically linked
Originally static library existed
Static linking must performed module recompiled
All module required program sometimes statically linked copied executable file
This process resulting file known program
A static build may need used desired
A file intended shared shared object file
Modules used program loaded individual shared object memory rather copied linker creates single monolithic executable file program
Shared library statically linked meaning reference library module resolved module allocated memory executable file created
But often linking shared library postponed loaded
Most modern shared library file format executable file
This offer two main advantage first requires making one loader rather two single loader considered well worth added complexity
Secondly allows executables also used shared library
Typical combined executable shared library format Unix Windows
In older environment stack based data local allowed shared library code significant restriction placed shared library code
Library code may shared memory multiple well disk
If virtual memory used process would execute physical page RAM mapped different address space process
This advantage
For instance system application often hundred kilobyte size loaded quickly majority code located library already loaded purpose operating system
Programs accomplish RAM sharing using lead complex flexible architecture using common virtual address Windows
These system make sure various trick like address space reserving slot shared library code great probability shared
A third alternative used successor
This allows code place significant restriction code placed shared
In case different version shared library cause problem especially library different version file name different application installed system require specific version
Such scenario known named Windows
Most modern operating system method eliminate situation use application specific private library
Dynamic linking linking performed program loaded executed rather executable file created
A dynamically linked library DLL dynamic shared object DSO system library intended dynamic linking
Only minimum amount work done executable file created record library routine program need index name number routine library
The majority work linking done time application loaded load time execution run time
Usually necessary linking program called dynamic linker linking loader actually part underlying
However possible exceedingly difficult write program us dynamic linking includes dynamic linker even operating system provides support dynamic linking
Programmers originally developed dynamic linking operating system starting MTS built late
Since shared library system change often system compute likely load address shared library system needed store information library executables
If every shared library loaded undergone process load predetermined address speed process dynamic linking
This optimization known macOS Linux
Disadvantages technique include time required precompute address every time shared library change inability use requirement sufficient virtual address space use problem alleviated adoption architecture least time
Loaders shared library vary widely functionality
Some depend executable storing explicit path library
Any change library naming layout file system cause system fail
More commonly name library path stored executable operating system supplying method find library based algorithm
If shared library executable depends deleted moved renamed incompatible version library copied place earlier search executable would fail load
This called existing many platform
The infamous Windows variant commonly known
This problem occur version library uniquely identified program reference library full unique identifier
The DLL hell problem earlier Windows version arose using name library guaranteed unique resolve dynamic link program
To avoid DLL hell later version Windows rely largely option program install private partial retreat use shared mechanism prevent replacement shared system DLLs earlier version
check determine proper place load DLLs implement DLLs check directory defined order
First Windows check directory loaded program directory set calling function System Windows directory current working directory finally directory specified PATH
Applications written framework since also check primary store shared dll file remove issue
used flexible system collecting list library number known location similar PATH concept system first start
Moving library around cause problem although user incur time cost first starting system
Most system search path specifying file system look dynamic library
Some system specify default path others dynamic loader
Some format specify additional directory search library particular program
This usually overridden although disabled setgid program user ca force program run arbitrary code root permission
Developers library encouraged place dynamic library place default search path
On downside make installation new library problematic known location quickly become home increasing number library file making management complex
Dynamic loading subset dynamic linking involves dynamically linked library loading unloading request
Such request may made implicitly explicitly run time
Implicit request made compile time linker add library reference include file path simply file name
Explicit request made application make direct call operating system API run time
Most operating system support dynamically linked library also support dynamically loading library via linker
For instance us API function based system including UNIX system use
Some development system automate process
Although originally pioneered dynamic linking reach used consumer late
It generally available form operating system early
During period OOP becoming significant part programming landscape
OOP runtime binding requires additional information traditional library supply
In addition name entry point code located within also require list object depend
This one OOP main advantage inheritance mean part complete definition method may different place
This simply listing one library requires service another true OOP system library may known vary system system
At time many developer worked idea program display running desktop computer would use service data storage processing
For instance program computer would send message minicomputer return small sample huge dataset display
RPC already handled task standard RPC system
Soon majority minicomputer mainframe vendor instigated project combine two producing OOP library format could used anywhere
Such system known supported remote access
Microsoft COM example system local use DCOM modified version support remote access
For time object library held status next big thing programming world
There number effort create system would run across platform company competed try get developer locked system
Examples include DOE PDO Microsoft number system
After inevitable cooling marketing hype object library continue used programming distributed information system
rough OOP equivalent older type code library
They contain describe characteristic define action involve object
Class library used create object characteristic set specific value
In OOP language like distinction clear class often contained library file like Java instantiated object residing memory although potentially able made separate file
In others like class library merely starting point includes entire state environment class instantiated object
Another solution library issue come using completely separate executables often lightweight form calling using RPC network another computer
This approach maximizes operating system code needed support library code used provide application support security every program
Additionally system require library exist machine forward request network
However approach mean every library call requires considerable amount overhead
RPC call much expensive calling shared library already loaded machine
This approach commonly used make heavy use remote call notably system
Code generation library generate transform
They used data access framework testing generate dynamic proxy object
They also used intercept field access
The system store file directory
The filename always start end suffix static library shared object dynamically linked library
Some system might multiple name dynamically linked library name name remaining name name might include major version library full version number example system would filename second major interface revision dynamically linked library
The file sometimes found library directory archive usable system
The system inherits static library convention library stored file use dynamically linked library suffix instead
Most library macOS however consist framework placed inside special directory called wrap library required file metadata
For example framework called would implemented bundle called either dynamically linked library file symlink dynamically linked library file
usually suffix although file name extension may identify dynamically linked library
library
The interface revision either encoded file name abstracted away using interface
Depending compiled file either static library representation dynamically linkable library needed compilation known
Unlike world us different file extension linking file one must first know regular static library import library
In latter case file must present run time

In computing take one generated combine single file file another file
A simpler version writes output directly memory called though typically considered separate process
Computer program typically composed several part module need contained within single case refer mean
Typically object file contain three kind symbol For compiler object file result compiling one input source code file
When program comprises multiple object file linker combine file unified executable program resolving symbol go along
Linkers take object collection called
Some linkers include whole library output include symbol referenced object file library
Libraries exist diverse purpose one system library usually linked default
The linker also take care arranging object program
This may involve code assumes specific another base
Since compiler seldom know object reside often assumes fixed base location example zero
Relocating machine code may involve absolute jump load store
The executable output linker may need another relocation pas finally loaded memory execution
This pas usually omitted offering every program put address space conflict even program load base address
This pas may also omitted executable executable
On variant process performed linker assembling object file program called loading executable code onto file
Additionally operating system program handle job linking loading program
Many environment allow dynamic linking postponing resolving undefined symbol program run
That mean executable code still contains undefined symbol plus list object library provide definition
Loading program load well perform final linking
Dynamic linking need linker
This approach offer two advantage There also disadvantage Static linking result linker copying library routine used program executable image
This may require disk space memory dynamic linking portable since require presence library system run
Static linking also prevents DLL Hell since program includes exactly version library routine requires conflict program
In addition program using routine library require entire library installed
As compiler information layout object final output take advantage shorter efficient instruction place requirement address another object
For example jump instruction reference absolute address offset current location offset could expressed different length depending distance target
By generating conservative instruction usually largest relative absolute variant depending platform adding possible substitute shorter efficient instruction final link
This step performed input object read assigned temporary address pas subsequently reassigns address may turn allow relaxation occur
In general substituted sequence shorter allows process always converge best solution given fixed order object case relaxation conflict linker need weigh advantage either option
While instruction relaxation typically occurs relaxation already take place part optimising process
In case relaxation also occur part relocation process combined technique
In environment including mainframe type program known
However linkage name implies additional capability allowing addition replacement deletion individual program section
Operating system different format executable contain supplementary data component section program individual program section replaced part program updated relocatable address reference corrected linkage editor part process
One advantage allows program maintained without keep intermediate object file without program section changed
It also permit program update distributed form small file originally card deck containing object module replaced
In system object code form format image update introduced system using medium
In later release subsequent system contain additional data version component module create traceable record update
Note term linkage editor construed implying program operates mode like example text editor
It strictly intended execution editing command supplied user sequentially organized record unit record medium card deck example DASD medium disk file example tape also supported tape often used initial installation OS

In part responsible loading
It one essential stage process starting program place program memory prepares execution
Loading program involves reading content containing program instruction memory carrying required preparatory task prepare executable running
Once loading complete operating system start program passing control loaded program code
All operating system support program loading loader apart highly specialized computer system fixed set specialized program
typically loader instead code executes directly ROM
In order load operating system part specialized used
In many operating system loader permanently resident memory although operating system support may allow loader located region memory
In case operating system support virtual memory loader may actually copy content executable file memory rather may simply declare virtual memory subsystem mapping region memory allocated contain running program code content associated executable file
See
The virtual memory subsystem made aware page region memory need filled demand program execution actually hit area unfilled memory
This may mean part program code actually copied memory actually used unused code may never loaded memory
In loader
The Unix loader task include In loader function contained following Some operating system need adjust address pointer executable compensate variation address loading start
The operating system need relocating loader program always loaded location address space pointer absolute address rather offset program
Some example IBM mainframe descendant including mainframe
In descendant system privileged operating system facility called IEWFETCH internal component OS Supervisor whereas LOADER application perform many function plus Linkage Editor entirely external OS Supervisor although certainly us many Supervisor service
IEWFETCH utilizes highly specialized theoretically possible load relocate entire executable within one revolution DASD medium m maximum m average legacy rpm drive
For load module exceed track size also possible load relocate entire module without losing revolution medium
IEWFETCH also incorporates facility overlay structure facilitates running potentially large executables minimum memory model small KB version OS KB KB common
The OS always resident portion Supervisor formatted way compatible version IEWFETCH
Unlike normal executables OS nucleus scatter loaded part nucleus loaded different portion memory particular certain system table required reside initial KB table code may reside elsewhere
The system application named IEWL
IEWL main function associate load module executable program object module output say assembler compiler including automatic call library language function format may efficiently loaded IEWFETCH
There large number editing option conventional application commonly employed
The load module format includes initial text record followed immediately relocation control record text record followed instance text record relocation control record pair end module
The text record usually large relocation control record small IEWFETCH three relocation control record buffer fixed byte smaller relocation control record certainly possible byte maximum possible IEWL ensures limitation complied inserting additional relocation record required next text record necessary special case sequence record may text record relocation record control record text record
A special byte within relocation control record buffer used disabled bit spin communication area initialized unique value
The Read CCW relocation control record Program Controlled Interrupt bit set
The processor thereby notified CCW accessed channel via special exit
At point processor enters disabled bit spin loop sometimes called shortest loop world
Once byte changed initialized value processor instantaneously know reading relocation control record completed bit spin terminated relocation may proceed synchronously rotation medium relocation occurs gap within medium relocation control record next text record
If relocation text record completed NOP CCW changed TIC loading relocating proceed using next buffer
If channel encounter NOP CCW channel program terminate restarted IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit
The three buffer continuous circular queue pointing next last pointing first three buffer constantly reused loading relocating proceeds
IEWFETCH thereby load relocate load module practical size minimum possible time
another type loader load link like already loaded running program

Programming involves creating file called
Most programming involves two additional important type file An executable file contains program data instruction associated information required producing memory image execute program
Object file motivated desire support capability breaking complex program smaller piece compiled assembled independently
For program produced assembling compiling several source code file assembly compilation source code file produce object code file contains portion executable file produced source code file
In addition object file contains information needed connect object file together
The format file type memory image defined operating system
An operating system also provides support software called loader linkers handling file type
In modern operating system software executed part dynamically code executing
There executable file considered whose format defined operating system
These file handled interpreter language Java Perl Ruby
The format object executable file depends operating system
Compilers assembler adapted different operating system order generate output conforms appropriate format
On Microsoft Windows platform object file name suffix
Compiled assembled executable file name suffix
On Unix based platform object file name suffix
There conventional file name suffix compiled assembled executable file
A Unix operating system however recognize file type special code start file
A loader take executable file copy section memory
Then produce process control block control program execution
Finally start executing code usually jumping main address
A loader must able Relevant information must included executable file format
Some need considered design executable file format executable file us separate data text section executable file includes section symbol table associating executed code source code The ability break source code program smaller code unit two important advantage But separate compilation introduces two problem When compiler allocates memory location source code file start address address set aside operating system
Only one source code file use address
The others relocated address reference changed accordingly
To useful separately compiled file must reference
For example one file call subprogram another file
The address external reference known file compiled separately
Supporting separate compilation requires operating system software combine code multiple compilation step
This software called simply
The object file result compiling single source code file
As often case computer science distinction following meaning In keeping common terminology linking loading described earlier called
refers linking loading done program execution
Modern operating system typically use dynamic linking loading programming language library function
Dynamic linking loading three important benefit A jump table implementation dynamic linking loading lazy defers loading linking subprogram needed
However loading linking done per subprogram
After loaded linked subprogram called many time needed negligible overhead
Multiple dynamically linked subprogram typically gathered library file called
These file typically use suffix Windows operating system suffix operating system

In computer science computer program take one generated combine one program
Computer program usually made multiple span separate object file compiled computer program
The program whole refers object file using symbol
The linker combine separate file single unified program resolving symbolic reference go along
similar process available many operating system postpones resolution symbol program executed
When program run loaded well
Dynamic linking require linker

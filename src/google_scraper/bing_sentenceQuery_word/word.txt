In natural unit data used particular design
A word handled unit hardware processor
The number word important characteristic specific processor design
The size word reflected many aspect computer structure operation majority processor usually word sized largest piece data transferred single operation word many architecture
The largest possible size used designate location memory typically hardware word hardware word mean natural word processor opposed definition used
Modern processor including usually word size modern general purpose computer usually use bit
Special purpose digital processor instance may use size many size used historically including bit
The example system earlier word size
Several earliest computer modern well used rather plain typically word size decimal digit early fixed word length
The size word sometimes differ expected due earlier computer
If multiple compatible variation family processor share common architecture instruction set differ word size documentation software may become notationally complex accommodate difference see
Depending computer organized unit may used When computer architecture designed choice word size substantial importance
There design consideration encourage particular size particular us
address consideration point different size different us
However consideration economy design strongly push one size size related multiple fraction submultiples primary size
That preferred size becomes word size architecture
size past one influence unit address resolution choice word size
Before character often stored six bit allowed character alphabet limited upper case
Since efficient time space word size multiple character size word size period usually multiple bit binary machine
A common choice also good size numeric property floating point format
After introduction design used character supported letter standard size character accurately became eight bit
Word size thereafter naturally multiple eight bit bit commonly used
Early machine design included used often termed
In type organization numeric operand fixed length rather end detected character special marking often called encountered
Such machine often used number
This class machine included
Most machine work one unit memory time since instruction datum several unit long instruction take several cycle access memory
These machine often quite slow
For example instruction fetch take cycle read digit instruction reduced cycle cycle instruction need address field
Instruction execution took completely variable number cycle depending size operand
The memory model architecture strongly influenced word size
In particular resolution memory address smallest unit designated address often chosen word
In approach address value differ one designate adjacent memory word
This natural machine deal almost always word unit advantage allowing instruction use minimally sized field contain address permit smaller instruction size larger variety instruction
When byte processing significant part workload usually advantageous use rather word unit address resolution
This allows arbitrary character within character string addressed straightforwardly
A word still addressed address used requires bit alternative
The word size need integer multiple character size organization
This addressing approach used IBM common approach machine designed since
Individual byte accessed machine one two way
Bytes manipulated combination shift mask operation register
Moving single byte one arbitrary location another may require equivalent following Alternatively many machine implement byte operation instruction using special register memory
For example byte pointer contained size byte bit allowing byte accessed bit position byte within word word address data
Instructions could automatically adjust pointer next byte example load deposit store operation
Different amount memory used store data value different degree precision
The commonly used size usually multiple unit address resolution byte word
Converting index item array address item requires operation rather multiplication
In case relationship also avoid use division operation
As result modern computer design word size operand size power two time size byte
As computer design grown complex central importance single word size architecture decreased
Although capable hardware use wider variety size data market force exert pressure maintain extending processor capability
As result might central word size fresh design coexist alternative size original word size backward compatible design
The original word size remains available future design forming basis size family
In designed successor
They used quantity referred quantity
This contrast earlier machine natural unit addressing memory would called quantity one half word would called
In fitting scheme VAX bit
Another example family processor three different word length later released
As software routinely one next documentation define refer older thus shorter full word length CPU software may compiled
Also similar byte used small number many program shorter word bit may used context range wider word needed especially save considerable stack space cache memory space
For example Microsoft maintains definition bit despite fact API may used processor standard word size would bit respectively
Data structure containing different sized word refer byte byte byte respectively
A similar phenomenon developed support various size backward compatibility instruction set instruction mnemonic carry q identifier denoting term architecture original word size
In general new processor must use data word length virtual address width older processor older processor
Often carefully written source code written mind recompiled run variety processor even one different data word length different address width

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In computer architecture word unit data defined bit length addressed moved computer
Usually defined bit length word equivalent width computer data bus word moved single operation storage processor
For computer architecture word multiple eight bit
In IBM evolutionary architecture word bit four contiguous byte
In Intel PC processor architecture word bit two contiguous byte
Some computer processor architecture support half word half bit length word double word doubleword two contiguous word
Intel processor architecture also support quadword two contiguous doublewords double quadword two contiguous quadwords
A word contain computer storage address application data manipulated example added data another word space
In architecture double word larger unit required contain instruction address application data
Typically instruction word length architecture support halfword instruction
In general longer architected word length computer processor single operation

I tried get grasp mean I looked wiki definition vague
So question
Is length data bus address bus
Word size refers number bit processed computer CPU one go day typically bit bit
Data bus size instruction size address size usually multiple word size
Just confuse matter backwards compatibility Microsoft Windows API defines WORD bit DWORD bit QWORD bit regardless processor
One answer much used
Way back computer could full word memory would bit depending particular machine
One would carefully structure program design around word size target machine
But computer access individual byte access string data dozen byte long one relatively seamless operation
Much significant technical word size memory bus width determines many byte transferred CPU memory one memory cycle
So word size somewhat meaningless another answer suggests company like Microsoft often define arbitrary manner real relationship anything
Word size mean
bit data processed microprocessor unit
Just add description
It obvious CPU main processor computer
So get data process
Ans RAM Random Access Memory store temporary data processed
So CPU load data RAM via bus one limitation amount data load time
How many bit
far I know
Those bit word size computer
So basically amount data loaded processed CPU represents called word size
word size mean fixed size length bit within processor architecture By posting answer agree

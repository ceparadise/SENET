In necessary run system
When user open counted therefore requires allocate certain able run
Such resource could access section computer data device interface buffer one required amount power
A computer single processor perform one process time regardless amount program loaded user initiated
Computers using single processor appear running multiple program processor quickly alternate program processing needed small amount time
This process known
The time allocation automatic however higher lower priority may given certain process essentially giving high priority program processor time
On computer different process allocated different processor computer truly multitask
Some program require intense processing power coded able run one processor thus running quickly efficiently
This method generally suitable multiprogramming environment actually helpful

Cloud Computing environment provision supply computing resource basis demand needed
It build upon advance virtualisation distributed computing support cost efficient usage computing resource emphasizing resource scalability service
It allows business outcome scale resource based need
Managing customer demand creates challenge resource allocation
Virtual Machine VM technology employed resource provisioning
It expected using virtualized environment reduce average job response time well executes task according availability resource
Hence VMs allocated user based characteristic job
Effective dynamic utilization resource cloud help balance load avoid situation like slow run system
This paper mainly focus allocation VM user based analyzing characteristic job
Main principle work low priority job deadline job high delay execution high priority job deadline job low dynamically allocate VM resource user job within deadline responsibility organizing committee Graph Algorithms High Performance Implementations Applications

Common Searches Ubiquitous sensing smart city enables data collected pose several challenge requires capture complexity dynamic system
system CPSs integrating machine learning statistical method optimization control highly desirable since existing technique CPSs become inadequate
For instance identify analyze dynamical interplay phenomenon mobility demand supply data take action improve service efficiency still challenging unsolved problem transportation system
In talk present dynamic robust resource allocation framework match supply towards uncertain demand seeking reduce total resource allocation cost
First present receding horizon control framework incorporates historical sensing data demand prediction dispatch decision practical constraint
However demand prediction error negligible affect system performance
Therefore demand uncertainty model constructed data develop two computationally tractable robust resource allocation method provide probabilistic guarantee system expected performance
As case study evaluated proposed framework using real taxi operational data
Lastly I provide overview research us knowledge system dynamic guarantee security resiliency property CPSs
I introduce research coding scheme stealthy data injection attack detection stochastic game scheme resilient control strategy

Within field information processing approach goal understanding human thinking relation process kind information computer Shannon Weaver
It arose World War II Sternberg Sternberg
The approach treat essentially nature brain
The information processing approach psychology closely allied philosophy also related though identical psychology philosophy Horst
Information processing may either may
The approach became popular name
The connectionist network made different node work priming effect happens prime node activates connected node Sternberg Sternberg
But unlike semantic network single node specific meaning rather knowledge represented combination differently activated node Goldstein cited Sternberg
There several proposed model theory describe way process information
Sternberg made three different component creative analytical practical ability Sternberg Sternberg
Creativeness ability new original idea analytical help person decide whether idea good one
Practical ability used implement idea persuade others value Sternberg Sternberg
In middle Sternberg theory cognition information processing
In Sternberg theory say information processing made three different part metacomponents performance component component Sternberg Sternberg
These process move executive function lower order function
Metacomponents used planning evaluating problem performance component follow order metacomponents component learns solve problem Sternberg Sternberg
This theory action explained working art project
First decision draw plan sketch
During process simultaneous monitoring process whether producing desired accomplishment
All step fall metacomponent processing performance component art
The portion learning improving drawing skill
According definition information processing science concerned gathering manipulating storing retrieving classifying recorded information
It suggests information firmly implanted memory must pas three stage mental processing sensory memory memory memory
An example working memory model
This includes central executive phonologic loop episodic buffer visuospatial sketchpad verbal information long term memory visual information Sternberg Sternberg
The central executive like secretary brain
It decides need attention central executive lead three different subsection
The first phonological storage subvocal rehearsal phonological loop
These section work together understand word put information memory hold memory
The result verbal information storage
The next subsection visuospatial sketchpad work store visual image
The storage capacity brief lead understanding visual stimulus
Finally episodic buffer
This section capable taking information putting memory
It also able take information phonological loop visuospatial sketchpad combining memory make unitary episodic representation Sternberg Sternberg
In order work sensory register take via five sens visual auditory tactile olfactory taste
These present since birth able handle simultaneous processing food taste smell see
In general learning benefit occur developed process pattern recognition
The sensory register large capacity behavioral response short second
Within model sensory store short term memory working memory limited capacity
Sensory store able hold limited amount information limited amount time
This phenomenon similar picture taken flash
For brief moment flash go flash seems still
However soon gone way know Sternberg Sternberg
Short term memory hold information slightly longer period time still limited capacity
According Linden The capacity STM initially estimated seven plus minus two item Miller fit observation neuropsychological testing average digit span healthy adult seven Cowan others
However emerged number item retained grouped chunk using perceptual conceptual association individual stimulus
Its duration second subject mind
This occurs often name people newly introduced
Images information based meaning stored well decay without rehearsal repetition information
On hand memory potentially unlimited capacity Sternberg Sternberg duration indefinite
Although sometimes difficult access encompasses everything learned point time
One might become forgetful feel information
Another approach viewing way information processed human suggested called Presnell
Piaget developed model based development growth
He identified four different stage different age bracket characterized type information distinctive thought process
The four stage sensorimotor birth year preoperational year concrete operational year formal operational period year older
During sensorimotor stage newborn toddler rely sens information processing respond reflex
In preoperational stage child learn imitation remain unable take people point view
The concrete operational stage characterized developing ability use logic consider multiple factor solve problem
The last stage formal operational preadolescents adolescent begin understand abstract concept develop ability create argument counter argument
Furthermore adolescence characterized series change biological cognitive social realm
In cognitive area worth noting brain prefrontal cortex well limbic system undergoes important change
The prefrontal cortex part brain active engaged complicated cognitive activity planning generating goal strategy intuitive thinking thinking
This consistent Piaget last stage formal operation McLeod
The prefrontal cortex becomes complete adolescence early adulthood
The limbic system part brain modulates reward sensitivity based change level neurotransmitter dopamine emotion
In short cognitive ability vary according development stage life
It adult stage better able better planner process comprehend abstract concept evaluate risk benefit aptly adolescent child would able
In computing broadly refers use algorithm transform defining activity computer indeed broad computing professional organization known International Federation Information Processing
It essentially synonymous term although general connotation

In late century information acquired two major utilitarian
On one hand considered economic resource somewhat par resource labour material capital
This view stem evidence possession manipulation use information increase many physical process
The rise activity industrial well human remarkable
Analysis one three traditional division economy show sharp increase activity since beginning century
By activity accounted half United States see Table giving rise information society
As individual societal resource information interesting characteristic separate traditional notion economic resource
Unlike resource information expansive limit apparently imposed time human cognitive capability
Its expansiveness attributable following naturally diffusive reproduces rather consumed use shared exchanged transaction
At time information compressible syntactically semantically
Coupled ability substituted economic resource transportability high speed ability impart advantage holder information characteristic base societal industry research education publishing marketing even politics
Societal concern husbanding information resource extended traditional domain library organizational institutional governmental information umbrella information resource management
The second perception information economic commodity help stimulate worldwide growth new segment national information service sector
Taking advantage property information building perception individual societal utility value sector provides broad range information product service
By market share information service sector grown billion
This equivalent country computer market turn represented roughly percent global market computer year
However probable convergence computer television constitutes market share time larger computer impact information service entertainment education likely restructure respective market share information
Humans receive information sound hearing image text sight shape temperature affection touch odour smell
To interpret signal received sens human developed learned complex system language consisting alphabet symbol stimulus associated rule usage
This enabled recognize object see understand message read hear comprehend sign received olfactory sens
The carrier sign received sens energy wave light wave chemical electrochemical stimulus
In engineering parlance human receptor analog signal somewhat loose convention message conveyed via carrier called information simply
Until development cognitive information stored processed analog form basically technology printing photography telephony
Although human adept processing information stored memory analog information stored external mind processed easily
Modern information technology greatly manipulation externally stored information result representation digital presence absence energy electricity light magnetism
Information represented digitally form often referred digital information
Modern information system characterized extensive analog digital information
With respect information storage communication transition analog digital information bring historic transformation manner human create access use information
The principal category information source useful modern information system text video voice
One first way prehistoric human communicated sound represented concept pleasure anger fear well object surrounding environment including food tool
Sounds assumed meaning use consistently put
Combining part sound allowed representation complex concept gradually led development speech eventually spoken natural language
For information communicated broadly need stored external human memory accumulation human experience knowledge learning would severely limited without storage development system made necessary
Civilization traced time human began associate abstract shape concept sound speech represented
Early recorded representation visually perceived object event example animal activity depicted Paleolithic cave drawing
The evolution writing system proceeded early development language symbol would represent entire concept
Such symbol would go many metamorphosis shape resemblance symbol object stood gradually disappeared semantic meaning would become precise
As world human became larger symbol called grew number
Modern Chinese result evolutionary direction pictographic writing system upwards ideograph
At point evolution written language method representation shifted pictographic phonetic speech sound began represented alphabet graphic symbol
Combinations relatively small set symbol could stand complex concept word phrase sentence
The written phonetic alphabet thought taken place millennium
The pragmatic advantage alphabetic writing system pictographic became apparent twice past millennium invention century development information processing electronic mean since
From time early human learned represent concept symbolically used whatever material readily available nature recording
The Sumerian writing system impressed soft subsequently hardened drying sun oven
The earliest dating millennium preserved animal bone shell early writing India done palm leaf birch bark
Applications technology yielded material writing
The Chinese recorded pictograph silk using brush made animal hair long invented paper
The first wrote cotton began using sheet roll made fibrous lining papyrus plant millennium
The reed brush palette wrote hieroglyphic script
Writing material superior papyrus made prepared skin animal became commonplace year first recorded use quill replaced reed brush
By century parchment came principal writing material Europe
invented China beginning century year use confined East Asia
In Arab Chinese army clashed Battle Talas near Samarkand among Chinese taken captive papermakers Arabs learned technique
From century paper became dominant writing material
Papermaking finally reached Spain Sicily century took another three century practiced Germany
With invention movable type became standard method creating copy
Typesetting entirely manual operation adoption keyboard century
In fact mechanized process recording original text
Although typewriter invented early century England first practical version constructed American inventor appear
The mechanical typewriter finally found wide use World War I
Today electronic variant computer video terminal used pervasively record original text
Recording original nontextual image information manual process development early decade century drawing carving principal early mean recording graphic
Other technique developed alongside example etching stone metal
The invention film photographic process added new dimension information acquisition first time complex visual image real world could captured accurately
Photography provided method storing information le space accurately previously possible narrative information
During century versatile electromagnetic medium opened new possibility capturing original analog information
used capture speech music magnetic provides medium recording analog voice video signal directly simultaneously
Magnetic technology us direct recording analog information including alphanumerics
Magnetic character bar code special mark printed check label form subsequent sensing magnetic optical reader conversion digital form
Banks educational institution retail industry rely heavily technology
Nonetheless paper film continue dominant medium direct storage textual visual information analog form
The versatility modern information system stem ability represent information electronically digital signal manipulate automatically exceedingly high speed
Information stored device basic component technology
Because device exist one two state information represented either absence presence energy electric pulse
The two state binary device conveniently designated binary digit bit zero one
In manner alphabetic symbol writing system represented digitally combination zero pulse one pulse
Tables equivalence alphanumeric character string binary digit called coding system counterpart writing system
A combination three binary digit represent eight character one four digit character
The choice particular coding system depends size character set represented
The widely used system American Standard Code Information Interchange code representing English alphabet numeral certain special character standard computer keyboard corresponding EBCDIC used computer produced IBM International Business Machines compatible system
The digital representation character eight bit called
The ASCII code capable representing alphanumeric special accommodate writing system many phonetic script including Latin Cyrillic
Some alphabetic script require seven bit example also used Urdu Persian language consonantal character well number vowel diacritical mark may four shape depending position word
For digital representation nonalphabetic writing system even code accommodating character inadequate
Some writing system use Chinese character example ideograph minimal standard Hanzi system Chinese kanji system Japanese ideograph
Digital representation script accomplished three way
One approach develop phonetic character set Chinese Pinyin Korean Hangul Japanese hiragana phonetic scheme alphabetic set similar number
As use phonetic alphabet Oriental yet widespread may converted ideographic mean dictionary lookup
A second technique decompose ideograph small number elementary sign called stroke sum constitutes nonphonetic alphabet
The third approach use eight bit encode large number ideograph instance two byte represent uniquely ideograph
Because ASCII code inadequate number writing system either nonalphabetic phonetic script posse large number diacritical mark computer industry began formulating new international coding standard based bit
perforated paper tape widely used store data
Today supplanted medium based electromagnetic technology except special application storage medium two type access
In medium primary memory time required accessing given piece data independent location medium access time depends data location position head
The typical medium magnetic tape
The storage density magnetic tape increased considerably year mainly increase number track packed across width tape
While magnetic tape remains popular choice application requiring storage data exchange new tape variant began entering market
Video recording tape adapted digital storage DAT surpasses tape storage device offering highest areal data density
DAT technology us recording method tape recording head move simultaneously allows extremely high recording density

It estimated percent document United States exist digitized form paper document digitized keyboard transcription contain drawing still image transcription would highly uneconomical
Such document digitized economically process called see
Document imaging utilizes digital scanner generate digital representation document page
An divide page minute picture area called produce array binary digit representing brightness pixel
The resulting stream bit compressed little percent original volume device called image controller stored magnetic optical medium
A large storage capacity required take byte store typical compressed text page character much byte store page containing image
Aside document imaging application digital scanning used transmission document via facsimile satellite photography application
An image scanner digitizes entire document page storage display image recognize character word text
The stored material therefore linguistically manipulated text processing software technique
When manipulation desired software program performs OCR function converting optically scanned character electric signal comparing internally stored representation alphabet character select one match scanned character closely reject unidentifiable token
The sophisticated OCR program distinguish shape size pitch learn experience
A universal OCR available however even single alphabet
Still digitized scanning transferred film compact digital disc holding image
A recent development make possible bypass step completely capturing image special diskette transferring
Since technology produce graphic file either case image editable mean suitable software

These capability opened way new kind multimedia document employ print video sound generate powerful colourful message communicate securely electronic speed allow modified almost
The traditional business letter journal longer
The development recording medium technique enabled society begin building store human knowledge
The idea collecting organizing written record thought originated year ago writing introduced soon
Early collection Sumerian Egyptian writing recorded cuneiform clay tablet hieroglyphic script papyrus contained legal economic transaction
In early collection produced millennium collection India dating century difficult separate concept archive library
From Middle East concept document collection penetrated world
Roman king institutionalized population property census early century
The great established century best known large collection papyrus containing inventory property tax payment citizen ruler
It short ancient equivalent today administrative information system
The scholarly splendour Islamic world century large part attributed maintenance public private book library
The House Wisdom founded Baghdad contained public library large collection material wide range subject library Caliph Cordova Spain boasted book
The late rapid development European library century followed invention printing movable type spurred growth printing publishing industry
Since beginning century become principal medium knowledge
The phrase primary literature used designate original information various printed format newspaper monograph conference proceeding learned trade journal report patent bulletin newsletter
The classic medium scientific communication first appeared
Three hundred year later number periodical title published world estimated reflecting growth number practitioner science expansion body knowledge specialization also maturing system reward encourages scientist publish
The sheer quantity printed information time prevented individual fully absorbing even minuscule fraction
Such device table content summary index various type aid identifying locating relevant information primary literature use since century led development termed secondary literature century
The purpose secondary literature filter primary information source usually subject area provide indicator literature form review
Over past year evolved system disciplinary national international abstracting indexing service act gateway several attribute primary literature author subject publisher date language publication citation
The professional activity associated tool called documentation
The quantity printed material also make impossible well undesirable institution acquire house small portion
The husbanding recorded information become matter public policy many country established national archive direct orderly acquisition document record
Since institution alone able keep output document record new form cooperative planning sharing recorded material public private national regional library network
The emergence century affected humankind inventory recorded information dramatically
During early used digitize text first time purpose reduce cost time required publish two American abstracting journal National Library Medicine NASA
By late body digitized alphanumeric information known numeric database new type information resource
This resource husbanded outside traditional repository information library archive Advances computer storage telecommunication software computer sharing automated technique text indexing searching fueled development database service industry
Meanwhile electronic application bibliographic control library archive led development computerized catalog union catalog library network
They also resulted introduction automation program institution
The explosive growth communication network particularly scholarly world accelerated establishment virtual At leading edge development information
Residing thousand database distributed worldwide growing portion vast resource accessible almost instantaneously via web computer network linking global researcher increasingly nonacademic organization
Internet resource electronic information include selected library catalog collected work literature abstracting journal electronic journal encyclopaedia scientific data numerous discipline software archive register daily news summary environmental report price commodity market well hundred thousand message
The vast inventory recorded information useful systematically organized mechanism exist locating item relevant human need
The main approach achieving organization reviewed following section tool used retrieve desired information
In collection physical object related order
The ordering may random according characteristic called key
Such characteristic may property object size weight shape colour may assigned set object class date purchase
The value key arranged sorting sequence dependent type key involved alphanumeric key value usually sorted alphabetic sequence type may sorted basis similarity class book particular subject flora genus
In case order imposed set information object two reason create inventory locating specific object set
There also exist secondary objective selecting particular ordering example conservation space economy effort fetching object
Unless object collection replicated ordering scheme unable meet function ordering equal effectiveness
The main approach overcoming limitation ordering recorded information relies extended description content information feature physical item
This approach employ various tool content analysis subsequently facilitate accessing searching recorded information
The collection library archive primary repository information constitute ordering physical material print document image form map photograph format recording videotape
To break away confines ordering librarianship developed extensive set attribute term describes item collection
The rule assigning attribute called rule
Descriptive cataloging extraction bibliographic element author name title publisher date publication etc
item assignment subject category heading item termed
Conceptually library catalog table matrix row describes discrete physical item column provides value assigned key
When catalog represented digitally computer attribute serve ordering key
By sorting catalog different key possible produce variety index well subject bibliography
More important attribute computerized catalog becomes search key access point collection surpassing utility traditional card catalog
The useful access key item subject
The extensive list subject heading scheme provide however gross access content item
A technique called provides refinement library subject heading
It consists extracting item assigning subject descriptor phrase denoting significant concept topic name occur characterize content record
Indexing frequently accompanies abstracting technique condensing full text document short summary contains main idea invariably incurs information loss often introduces bias
indexed abstracting journal provide mean keeping user informed primary information source
The description electronic document generally follows principle bibliographic cataloging document part database expected accessed directly individually
When database element globally distributed database server searchable parallel matter document naming considerably challenging several complexity introduced
The document description must include name database physical location
Because database server may delete particular document description must also contain pointer document logical address generating organization
In contrast usefulness descriptive cataloging analog document physical attribute format size highly variable electronic document therefore meaningless universal scheme
On hand data type document text sound etc
critical transmission use
Perhaps challenging design living document constantly changing pastiche consisting section electronically copied different document interspersed original narrative graphic voice comment contributed person distant location whose different version reside different server
Efforts way standardize naming document universe electronic network
The subject analysis electronic text accomplished mean machine indexing using one two approach assignment subject descriptor unlimited vocabulary free indexing assignment list authorized descriptor controlled indexing
A collection authorized descriptor called authority list also display various relationship among descriptor synonymy thesaurus
The result indexing process computer file known inverted index alphabetic listing descriptor address occurrence document body
indexing use every character string word natural language text index term extreme case indexing word document except function word article preposition becomes access point
Used earlier generation concordance literary analysis computer application humanity indexing placed great demand computer storage resulting index least large body text
With decreasing cost mass storage automatic indexing capability incorporated routinely software
Text indexing may supplemented syntactic technique increase precision robustness
One method SGML take advantage standard text marker used editor pinpoint location characteristic document element paragraph table example
In indexing spatial data map astronomical image textual index specifies search area described set coordinate defining rectangle irregular polygon
These digital spatial document attribute used retrieve display specific point selected region document
There specialized technique may employed augment indexing specific document type encyclopaedia catalog bulletin board table map
The analysis digitally recorded information semantic viewpoint matter considerable complexity lie foundation application automatic question answering database retrieval mean unrestricted query
The general approach computational linguistics derive representation syntactic semantic relation linguistic element sentence larger part document
Syntactic relation described decomposing grammar sentence
For semantic representation three related formalism dominate
In conceptual entity object action event represented linked node
Frames represent similar graph network physical abstract attribute object sense define object
In script event action rather object defined term attribute
Indexing linguistic analysis text generate relatively gross measure semantic relationship subject similarity document given collection
Subject similarity however pragmatic phenomenon varies observer circumstance observation purpose time forth
A technique experimented briefly assigned document one role function one link pointer document similar role showed potential pragmatic measure similarity use however unwieldy computing environment day
Some year later similar technique became popular name In technique document person group person consider related concept sequence hierarchy experience motive characteristic connected via mimicking way human associate idea
Objects linked need text speech music graphic image animation video interlinked database
The object stored hyperlink user easily navigate network association clicking series entry computer screen
Another technique elicits semantic relationship body text SGML
The content analysis image accomplished two primary method
Image processing set computational technique analyzing compressing reconstructing image
Pattern recognition process assignment visual logical pattern class based feature pattern relationship
The stage pattern recognition involve object identify distinguishing attribute extraction feature defining attribute assignment object class based feature
Both image processing pattern recognition extensive application various area including astronomy industrial robotics remote sensing satellite
The immediate objective content analysis digital speech conversion discrete sound element alphanumeric equivalent
Once represented speech subjected technique content analysis indexing linguistic analysis
Converting speech element alphanumeric counterpart intriguing problem shape speech sound embodies wide range many acoustic characteristic linguistic element speech clearly distinguishable one another
The technique used speech processing classify spectral representation sound match resulting digital spectrograph prestored template identify alphanumeric equivalent sound
The obverse technique template sound relatively straightforward approach generating speech
Speech processing complex well expensive term storage capacity computational requirement
system identify limited vocabulary part distinctly spoken speech programmed recognize tonal idiosyncracies individual speaker
When reliable technique become available process made computationally tractable expected parallel computer human able interact computer via spoken command query routine basis
In many situation may make keyboard obsolete device
Digital information complex pattern make address operate even smallest element symbolic expression well larger string word sentence image sound
From viewpoint digital information storage useful distinguish structured data inventory object represented short symbol string number unstructured data text document pictorial image
The principal objective storage structure facilitate processing data element basis relationship structure thus vary type relationship represent
The choice particular storage structure governed relevance relationship allows represented requirement task system hand
In information system whose store consists unstructured database record objective retrieve record portion thereof basis presence record word short phrase constitute query
Since exists index separate file provides information location word phrase database record relationship interest word adjacency calculated index
Consequently database text stored simple ordered sequential file record
The majority computation use index access text file pull record portion satisfy result computation
The sequential file structure remains popular software intended use personal computer database
When relationship data element need represented part record make efficient desired operation record two type chained commonly used hierarchical network
In record arranged scheme resembling family tree record related one another top bottom
In record arranged grouping known set connected number way giving rise considerable flexibility
In hierarchical network structure relationship shown mean identifier address key become part record
Another type database storage structure become increasingly popular since late
Its major advantage hierarchical network structure ability handle unanticipated data relationship without pointer
Relational storage structure table consisting row column much like conceptual library catalog mentioned
The elegance lie conceptual simplicity availability theoretical underpinnings relational algebra ability associated software handle data relationship without use pointer
The relational model initially used database containing highly structured information
In largely replaced hierarchical network model also became model choice application textual multimedia
The feasibility storing large volume full text economical medium digital optical disc renewed interest study storage structure permit powerful retrieval processing technique operate cognitive entity word facilitate extensive semantic content analysis organize text conceptually logical unit rather dictated printing convention
The us database manifold
They provide mean retrieving record part record performing various calculation displaying result
The interface manipulation specified called query language
Whereas early query language originally complex interacting electronic database could done specially trained individual recent interface allowing casual user access database information
The main type popular query mode technique structured query
Particularly suited novice menu requires person choose several displayed video terminal screen
The technique one user prompted enter key word search statement
The structured query approach effective relational database
It formal powerful fact programming language able accommodate logical operator
One implementation approach SQL form field Fa Fb

Fn database Da Db

Dn field Fa abc field Fb def
Structured query language support database searching operation using command find delete print sum forth
The sentencelike structure SQL query resembles natural language except syntax limited fixed
Instead using SQL statement possible represent query tabular form
The technique referred QBE display empty tabular form expects searcher enter search specification appropriate column
The program construct query table executes
The flexible query language course natural language
The use sentence constrained form search database allowed commercial database management software
These program parse syntax query recognize action word synonym identify name file record field perform logical operation required
Experimental system accept query spoken voice developed however ability employ unrestricted natural language query unstructured information require advance machine understanding natural language particularly technique representing semantic pragmatic context idea
The prospect intelligent conversation human large store digitally encoded knowledge
approach retrieving information employ two generic technique matching word query database index searching database aid hypermedia link
search made either general narrow scope mean logical operator disjunction conjunction
Because semantic involved indexing however precision retrieval percentage relevant document correctly retrieved far ideal various modification introduced improve
In one enhancement search output sorted degree relevance based statistical match key word query document another program automatically generates new query using one document considered relevant user
searching dominant approach text retrieval since early hypertext far largely confined personal corporate application
The exponential growth use presage significant change system technique
In information service number began operating beginning Internet user personal computer terminal called search simultaneously number database maintained computer called
The latter located different geographic site database contain different data type often use incompatible data format
The simultaneous distributed search possible client server agree standard document addressing scheme adopt common communication accommodates data type format used server
Communication service using different accomplished routing capable protocol translation
The architecture typical networked information system illustrated
Several representative client shown dumb terminal one internal processor personal computer PC Macintosh Mac NeXT machine
They access data server sharing common protocol well data provided service require protocol conversion via gateway
Network news service containing hundred news group variety subject user read post message
Evolving technique exemplified experimental interface NASA reference manual combine natural language hyperlink searching
Other technique seeking higher level retrieval precision effectiveness studied researcher involved neural network
The next major milestone may seamless information universe electronic network continuously filter content profile organizational personal interest information robot century

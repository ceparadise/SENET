Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

submitted Prospective computer science major
I currently also considering taking psychology minor UC wondering workload overwhelming
In addition school work I likely want get kind job well
Does sound doable workload much
Post comment
I heard tattoo artist Do get tattoo somewhere want hurt little bit short time
This forever
Decide based amount workload involved
If help I graduated undergrad computer engineering program minor mathematics computer science
The curriculum similar computer science
Some semester much intense others way really knowing much free time
probably little high hour figure average plenty week I spent much time
Keep mind everyone different optimal study habit
I suggest get program first test water
Good luck
Yeah plan far try workload computer science consider psychology minor second year
Thanks help
Every person ask different response
I chemical engineering major
So major everyone asks hard
Every person responds differently
Some say basically homework day every day study exam worried getting A
Some people social life homework last possible second put studying night manage A B get C fail
A question like entirely individual
Do I think chemE hard
Extremely
But I still time play game go friend etc
Hell I could probably manage part time I needed
However I friend feel like time anything ever
Ur totally right different people different thanks advice
It lot work
The CS class bad part usually taking time combine class like English Calculus require lot work outside class make rough
I think psychology minor would doable I would start least second since first year lot work
That said I think part time job psychology minor doable
There enough time day
Yeah thinking starting second year give time adjust
So I probably wait see well I adjust workload UC life
year CS
It really depends credit coming quick pick thing
Personally I came Calc Phys credit breeze thus far
I currently taking CS credit hour working part time
So definitely doable depends study habit
That good hear similar situation I entering little bit credit math possibly english relieve workload little
Thanks
deleted It cutting time get wasted
Not social time game time hour get wasted browsing internet reddit
And planning ahead help
It managing time really Assuming CS scale engineering engineering degree
I sure relatively heavy workload
That said I swim team fraternity different club also social life graduated B average
I also would say I good studying working hard I think doable work hard want get really good grade
technically engineering degree
A fuck load
They say work like extra hour week outside class get A lying
Its engineering degree
Its easy
Consider IT want practical application versus theory research
Also dont take calc
I find bad
A psych minor also doable
You take extra class
Thanks reply also take computer science major psychology minor
How far course
Assuming yet graduated I graduated last year CS major minor
I also worked hour week throughout entire program rarely felt overwhelmed
I looked adding psychology minor could fit course would major minor would require additional course would probably mean extra semester school
Just aware CS go
It necessarily programming even using computer
It organizing representing processing analyzing information using efficient correct method
I think understanding reason half CS class switch first year
Other I think lot people ca handle calculus
Yes I heard much misconception computer science made point research hopefully given good idea nature computer science
Damn sound tricky computer science major
How far course
PS Have already taken calc excused calc I would make significant difference
I longer one
The course little difficult require actually put forth decent effort
I could cut
O also didnt like type work I
I enjoy work IT much
I get actually apply skill learn diverse skill set
Digital medium favorite one sp far
I really enjpy using photoshop
I suggest trying add job engineering degree unless job study still effective
You need get adjusted year coop every quarter equivalent part time job whole year
I always committed percent either work study I think gave positive experience everyone different
Current CS senior
Workload bad experience coding prior starting
About third people c freshman coding since kid
seen line code get dept try fails teach middle help anybody
We really shitty graduation rate
I believe I started I came c student actually graduating people year
If still high school want c suggestion go literally school
Our professor part old touch real interesting adequately teaching student relevant material
For example Han teach material updated year
Our software design course give much paperwork actually time work programming project
The professor teach seen industry decade understand teaching u worst practice fail building thing real world
There standout prof Talaga Franco mostly outnumbered one new prof come google quit year dept refused let curriculum
Ever major engineering school supposed curriculum review every year c dept found technicality let never take look refreshing updating curriculum majority professor happy accept terrible state curriculum
The pushed curriculum review constantly shut
I came UC I gotten lot value I would consider I learned anything value modern CS course work
Rutgers Michigan penn purdue OSU substantially better choice CS still affordable public school
TL DR If want major CS come UC

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

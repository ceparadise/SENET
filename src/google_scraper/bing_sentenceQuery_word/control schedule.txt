In field transaction management system abstract model describe execution transaction running system
Often operation action ordered time performed set executed together system
If order time certain operation determined system used
Examples operation requesting read operation reading writing aborting committing requesting lock locking etc
Not transaction operation type included schedule typically selected operation type data access operation included needed reason describe certain phenomenon
Schedules schedule property fundamental concept database theory
The following example schedule In example horizontal axis represents different transaction schedule The vertical axis represents time order operation
Schedule D consists three transaction
The schedule describes action transaction seen
First Reads Writes object X Commits
Then Reads Writes object Y Commits finally Reads Writes object Z Commits
This example schedule sequential overlap time action three transaction sequential transaction interleaved time
Representing schedule D table rather list convenience identifying transaction operation glance
This notation used throughout article
A common way technical literature representing schedule list Usually purpose reasoning concurrency control database operation modeled occurring point time without duration
When satisfactory start end possibly point event specified rarely
Real executed operation always duration specified respective time occurrence event within exact time beginning completion concurrency control reasoning usually precedence time whole operation without looking quite complex detail operation matter operation another operation
Furthermore many case relationship two specific operation matter specified specified pair operation
In general operation transaction schedule interleave transaction executed concurrently time order operation transaction remain unchanged implied transaction program
Since always time order operation transaction matter need specified schedule general operation rather order pair determined list operation
Also general case transaction may consist several process properly represented partial order operation rather total order
Thus general schedule partial order operation containing partial order transaction
two operation represented operation existence pair mean always schedule general case ordered pair
Such set schedule represented DAG operation node cycle allowed since cycle mean first operation cycle another second operation cycle contradicts perception
In many case graphical representation graph used demonstrate schedule
Since list operation table notation used article always represents total order operation schedule total order represented list always represented DAG
The transaction executed see example serial schedule one transaction start running transaction ended
A schedule equivalent outcome serial schedule property
In schedule E order action transaction executed D end E give result Two action said conflict conflicting pair The following set action conflicting While following set action The schedule said following two condition satisfied A schedule said schedule one serial schedule
Another definition schedule graph committed transaction considered acyclic graph defined include also uncommitted transaction cycle involving uncommitted transaction may occur without conflict serializability violation
Which serial schedule
A schedule said obeys CO also schedule property
This mean order time transaction commitment event compatible precedence partial order respective transaction induced schedule acyclic precedence graph serializability graph conflict graph
This implies also
The CO property especially effective achieving distributed system
discovered obviously mentioned
Its correct definition appears however description related technique theory partial inaccurate misleading
For extensive coverage commitment ordering source see
Two schedule said following condition satisfied A schedule said serial schedule
Note definition schedule
Notice example example discussion time
There however schedule schedule transaction performing The example since serial schedule
Since determining whether schedule little practical interest
Transactions commit transaction whose change read commit
These schedule recoverable
F recoverable commits make value read correct
Then commit
In aborted abort value A read incorrect
In case database left consistent state
If transaction abort transaction commits relied unrecoverable schedule
In example G unrecoverable read value A written committed
later aborted therefore value read wrong since committed schedule unrecoverable
Also named cascadeless
Avoids single transaction abort lead series transaction rollback
A strategy prevent cascading abort disallow transaction reading uncommitted change another transaction schedule
The following example one discussion recoverable In example although recoverable avoid cascading abort
It seen abort aborted order maintain correctness schedule already read uncommitted value written
The following recoverable schedule avoids cascading abort
Note however update A always lost since aborted
Note Schedule would serializable would committed
Cascading abort avoidance sufficient necessary schedule recoverable
A schedule strict strictness property two transaction write operation precedes operation either read write commit abort event also precedes conflicting operation
Any strict schedule cascadeless converse
Strictness allows efficient recovery database failure
The following expression illustrate hierarachical containment relationship class The illustrates clause graphically
In practice general purpose database system employ recoverable primarily strict schedule

learn share knowledge build career
I trying find good definition get understanding really
It seems I must missing something obvious every time I read thread almost circular definition la thread thread execution way divide running task
Uh uh
Huh
It seems I read thread really concrete like process
It fact concept
From I understand way work processor executes command program termed need switch processing program bit store program currently executing somewhere Thread Local Storage start executing program instruction
And back forth
Such thread really concept one path execution program currently running
Unlike process really something conglomeration resource etc
As example definition really help much


From A thread computer science short thread execution
Threads way program divide termed split two simultaneously running task
Threads process differ one operating system another general thread contained inside process different thread process share resource different process multitasking operating system
So I right
Wrong
What thread really
Apparently thread also given call stack somewhat concrete
A thread independent set value processor register single core
Since includes Instruction Pointer aka Program Counter control executes order
It also includes Stack Pointer better point unique area memory thread else interfere
Threads software unit affected control flow function call loop goto instruction operate Instruction Pointer belongs particular thread
Threads often scheduled according prioritization scheme although possible design system one thread per processor core case every thread always running scheduling needed
In fact value Instruction Pointer instruction stored location sufficient determine new value Instruction Pointer
For instruction simply advance IP size instruction control flow instruction change IP predictable way
The sequence value IP take form path execution weaving program code giving rise name thread
A thread execution context information CPU need execute stream instruction
Suppose reading book want take break right want able come back resume reading exact point stopped
One way achieve jotting page number line number word number
So execution context reading book number
If roommate using technique take book using resume reading stopped
Then take back resume
Threads work way
A CPU giving illusion multiple computation time
It spending bit time computation
It execution context computation
Just like share book friend many task share CPU
On technical level execution context therefore thread consists value CPU register
Last thread different process
A thread context execution process bunch resource associated computation
A process one many thread
Clarification resource associated process include memory page thread process view memory file descriptor open socket security credential ID user started process
Processes like two people using two different computer use network share data necessary
Threads like two people using computer share data explicitly must carefully take turn
Conceptually thread multiple worker bee buzzing around address space
Each thread stack program counter thread process share memory
Imagine two program running time access object
Contrast process
Processes address space meaning pointer one process used refer object another unless use shared memory
I guess key thing understand In order define thread formally must first understand boundary thread operates
A computer program becomes loaded store computer memory begin execution
A process executed processor set processor
A process description memory contains vital information program counter keep track current position program
instruction currently executed register variable store file handle signal forth
A sequence instruction within program executed independently code
The figure show concept Threads within thus much information present memory description process shared across thread
Some information replicated stack stack pointer different memory area per thread register data
program main thread possibly one thread within program
Explicit operating system support required run multithreaded program
Fortunately modern operating system support thread Linux via NPTL BSD variant Mac OS X Windows Solaris AIX etc
Operating system may use different mechanism implement multithreading support
find information topic
That also
I going use lot text book Operating Systems Concepts ABRAHAM SILBERSCHATZ PETER BAER GALVIN GREG GAGNE along understanding thing
Any application resides computer form text code
We emphasize program process
A program passive entity file containing list instruction stored disk often called executable file
When start application create instance execution
This instance execution called process
EDIT As per interpretation analogous class instance class instance class process
An example process Google Chrome
When start Google Chrome process spawned The process responsible managing user interface well disk network
A new browser process created Chrome started
Only one browser process created
process contain logic rendering web page
Thus contain logic handling HTML Javascript image forth
As general rule new renderer process created website opened new tab several renderer process may active time
A process created type Flash QuickTime use
process contain code well additional code enables communicate associated renderer process browser process
To answer I think first know processor
A Processor piece hardware actually performs computation
EDIT Computations like adding two number sorting array basically executing code written Now moving definition thread
A thread comprises thread ID program counter register set stack
EDIT Definition thread intel website A Thread thread execution software term basic ordered sequence instruction passed processed single CPU core
So Renderer process Chrome application sort array number sorting take place execution
The grammar regarding thread seems confusing A process execution instance
Threads actual worker perform computation via CPU access
When multiple thread running process process provides common memory
EDIT All modern day computer one thread
The number thread computer depends number core computer
From Wikipedia Concurrent computing form computing several computation executed overlapping time sequentially one completing next start
This property may individual program computer So I could write program calculates sum number In program compute sum one process running thread execution I fork another process run different thread compute return result original process original process calculates sum
Unfortunately thread exist
A thread something tangible
You kill one others still running
You spawn new thread although thread process running separately inside process
On machine thread could run time
This taken Yahoo Answer A thread coding construct unaffect architecture application
A single process frequently may contain multiple thread
Threads also directly communicate since share variable
Processes independent execution unit state information
They also use address space interact process interprocess communication mechanism
However put simpler term thread like different task
So think something instance writing formula one paper
That considered one thread
Then another thread writing something else another piece paper
That multitasking come
Intel processor said AMD meant able perform multiple thread multitask much better
I sure logistics thread handled
I recall hearing processor going back forth I sure hopefully somebody else answer
The answer varies across different system different implementation important part Beyond thread could implemented within single process language runtime thread could coroutines thread could implemented within single process threading library thread could kernel construct
In several modern Unix system including Linux I familiar thread process merely thread share relatively thing parent
get memory mapping file table permission etc
Reading especially list flag really instructive
A thread nothing memory context Tanenbaum better put resource grouping execution rule
It software construct
The CPU idea thread exception processor hardware thread executes instruction
The kernel introduces thread process concept manage memory instruction order meaningful way
If want answer english here teacher told I asked You know run java program run program top bottom
Well thread basically way get around
Like opening two text box timer running time bunch stuff
I swear almost exactly said
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

In method work specified mean assigned resource complete work
The work may virtual computation element data turn scheduled onto hardware resource
A scheduler carry scheduling activity
Schedulers often implemented keep computer resource busy allow multiple user share system resource effectively achieve target
Scheduling fundamental computation intrinsic part computer system concept scheduling make possible single CPU
A scheduler may aim one many goal example maximizing total amount work completed per time unit minimizing time work becoming enabled first point begin execution resource minimizing time work becoming enabled finished case batch activity system responds hand first output user case interactive activity maximizing equal CPU time process generally appropriate time according priority workload process
In practice goal often conflict
throughput versus latency thus scheduler implement suitable compromise
Preference measured one concern mentioned depending upon user need objective
In environment industry example scheduler also must ensure process meet crucial keeping system stable
Scheduled task also distributed remote device across network administrative back end
The scheduler operating system module selects next job admitted system next process run
Operating system may feature three distinct scheduler type also known admission scheduler scheduler
The name suggest relative frequency function performed
The process scheduler part operating system decides process run certain point time
It usually ability pause running process move back running queue start new process scheduler known otherwise
The decides job process admitted ready queue main memory attempt made execute program admission set currently executing process either authorized delayed scheduler
Thus scheduler dictate process run system degree concurrency supported one time whether many process executed concurrently split process handled
The scheduler responsible controlling degree multiprogramming
In general process described either
An process one spends time spends computation
A process contrast generates request infrequently using time computation
It important scheduler selects good process mix process
If process ready queue almost always empty scheduler little
On hand process waiting queue almost always empty device go unused system unbalanced
The system best performance thus combination process
In modern operating system used make sure process get enough CPU time finish task
scheduling also important system system
For example interacting process often required prevent blocking due waiting
In case software typically used assist function addition underlying admission scheduling support operating system
The temporarily remove process main memory place secondary memory vice versa commonly referred swapping swapping also incorrectly paging
The scheduler may decide swap process active time process low priority process frequently process taking large amount memory order free main memory process swapping process back later memory available process unblocked longer waiting resource
Stallings Stallings In many system today support mapping virtual address space secondary storage swap file scheduler may actually perform role scheduler treating binary swapped process upon execution
In way segment binary required swapped demand lazy loaded
Stallings The also known decides ready process executed allocated CPU clock interrupt operating another form
Thus scheduler make scheduling decision much frequently scheduler scheduling decision minimum made every time slice short
This scheduler implying capable forcibly removing process CPU decides allocate CPU another process also known voluntary case scheduler unable force process CPU
A preemptive scheduler relies upon invokes run implement scheduling function
Another component involved function dispatcher module give control CPU process selected scheduler
It receives control kernel mode result interrupt system call
The function dispatcher involve following The dispatcher fast possible since invoked every process switch
During context switch processor virtually idle fraction time thus unnecessary context switch avoided
The time take dispatcher stop one process start another known
Scheduling discipline algorithm used distributing resource among party simultaneously asynchronously request
Scheduling discipline used handle packet traffic well share among disk drive printer embedded system etc
The main purpose scheduling algorithm minimize ensure fairness amongst party utilizing resource
Scheduling deal problem deciding outstanding request allocated resource
There many different scheduling algorithm
In section introduce several
In notion used alternative queuing data packet
The simplest scheduling algorithm scheduling algorithm scheduling
If differentiated guaranteed offered opposed communication may utilized
In advanced packet radio wireless network Downlink Packet Access cellular system may used take advantage
If channel condition favourable may increased
In even advanced system scheduling combined assigning component user best utilize
also known FCFS simplest scheduling algorithm
FIFO simply queue process order arrive ready queue
This commonly used example illustrated section
Earliest deadline first EDF dynamic scheduling algorithm used operating system place process priority queue
Whenever scheduling event occurs task finish new task released etc
queue searched process closest deadline next scheduled execution
Similar SJF
With strategy scheduler arranges process least estimated processing time remaining next queue
This requires advanced knowledge estimation time required process complete
The operating system assigns fixed priority rank every process scheduler arranges process ready queue order priority
process get interrupted incoming process
The scheduler assigns fixed time unit per process cycle
If process completes within get terminated otherwise rescheduled giving chance process
This used situation process easily divided different group
For example common division made foreground interactive process background batch process
These two type process different requirement may different scheduling need
It useful shared memory problem
A scheduler always try keep scheduled resource busy submitted job ready scheduled
In contrast conserving scheduler scheduler case may leave scheduled resource idle despite presence job ready scheduled
There several scheduling problem goal decide job go station time total minimized A common method embedded system schedule job manually
This example done fashion
Sometimes kernel divided three part Manual scheduling preemptive interrupt level
Exact method scheduling job often proprietary
When designing operating system programmer must consider scheduling algorithm perform best use system going see
There universal best scheduling algorithm many operating system use extended combination scheduling algorithm
For example us combination preemptive scheduling first first algorithm
In system thread dynamically increase decrease priority depending serviced already waiting extensively
Every priority level represented queue among thread among one
In sense response time short thread short critical system thread get completed quickly
Since thread use one time unit queue starvation problem longer thread
The algorithm used may simple process given equal time instance m usually m m cycling list
So process A executes m process B process C back process A
More advanced algorithm take account process priority importance process
This allows process use time process
The kernel always us whatever resource need ensure proper functioning system said infinite priority
In symmetric multiprocessing system considered increase overall system performance even may cause process run slowly
This generally improves performance reducing
IBM available three different scheduler
The difference variant often considered three different operating system Later virtual storage version MVS added feature scheduler schedule processor resource according elaborate scheme defined installation
Very early Microsoft Windows system feature scheduler
used scheduler meaning interrupt program
It relied program end tell OS need processor could move another process
This usually called cooperative multitasking
Windows introduced rudimentary preemptive scheduler however legacy support opted let bit application run without preemption
operating system use multilevel feedback queue
priority level defined priority normal priority priority soft priority requiring privilege assign
reserved Operating System
Users select priority assign running application Task Manager application thread management APIs
The kernel may change priority level thread depending CPU usage whether interactive
accepts responds input human raising priority interactive bounded process lowering CPU bound process increase responsiveness interactive application
The scheduler modified use modern processor keep track exactly many CPU cycle thread executed rather using interrupt routine
Vista also us priority scheduler queue disk defragmenters program interfere foreground operation
Mac OS us cooperative scheduling thread one process control multiple cooperative thread also provides preemptive scheduling multiprocessing task
The kernel schedule multiprocessing task using preemptive scheduling algorithm
All Process Manager process run within special multiprocessing task called blue task
Those process scheduled cooperatively using algorithm process yield control processor another process explicitly calling
Each process copy schedule process thread cooperatively thread yield control processor another thread calling
macOS us multilevel feedback queue four priority band thread normal system high priority kernel mode
Threads scheduled preemptively macOS also support cooperatively scheduled thread implementation Thread Manager
In AIX Version three possible value thread scheduling policy Threads primarily interest application currently consist several asynchronous process
These application might impose lighter load system converted multithreaded structure
AIX implement following scheduling policy FIFO round robin fair round robin
The FIFO policy three different implementation FIFO
The round robin policy named AIX fair round robin called
In priority level ranging used reserved task considered task level
For task time quantum switching process approximately m nice task approximately m
The scheduler ran ready process letting highest priority process go first run time slice placed expired queue
When active queue empty expired queue become active queue vice versa
However enterprise replaced scheduler backport maintained Linux Kernel series Linux kernel used distribution
In version kernel used developed many kernel developer Linux development
For many kernel time frame developed patch set improved interactivity scheduler even replaced scheduler
Con Kolivas work significantly implementation named Rotating Staircase Deadline inspired Ingo Molnár develop replacement earlier crediting Kolivas announcement
CFS first implementation fair queuing widely used operating system
The CFS us classic scheduling algorithm called originally invented
Fair queuing previously applied CPU scheduling name
The fair queuing CFS scheduler scheduling complexity O N N number task
Choosing task done constant time reinserting task run requires O log N operation implemented
The BFS also created Con Kolivas alternative CFS
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
reserved interrupt top half kernel user thread user thread idle user thread
Also like Linux us active queue setup also idle queue
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
reserved thread default policy user thread entered kernel thread user thread policy
us multilevel feedback queue priority ranging
Priorities reserved thread system thread thread low priority interrupt
Unlike Linux process done using time quantum given new priority put back queue
Solaris introduced two new scheduling class namely fixed priority class fair share class
The thread fixed priority priority range class priority dynamically adjusted
The fair scheduling class us CPU prioritize thread scheduling decision
CPU share indicate entitlement CPU resource
They allocated set process collectively known project

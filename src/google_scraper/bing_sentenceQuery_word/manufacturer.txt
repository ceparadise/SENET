It broad area includes design development product
Manufacturing engineering considered subdiscipline strong overlap
Manufacturing engineer success failure directly impact advancement technology spread innovation
This field manufacturing engineering emerged tool die discipline early century
It expanded greatly industrialized country introduced factory machine tool automated system production

Advanced statistical method These factory pioneered American electrical engineer initially ignored home country
The method quality control later turned Japanese factory world leader production quality
factory floor introduced late These arm grippers could perform simple task attaching car door quickly flawlessly hour day
This cut cost improved production speed
The history manufacturing engineering traced factory mid century USA century UK
Although large home production site workshop established China ancient Rome Middle East provides one first example factory modern sense word
Founded Republic Venice several hundred year factory ship assembly line using manufactured part
The Venice Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day height employed people
Many historian regard Matthew Boulton Soho Manufactory established Birmingham first modern factory
Similar claim made John Lombe silk mill Derby Richard Arkwright Cromford Mill
The Cromford Mill accommodate equipment held take material various manufacturing process
One historian Murno Gladst contends first factory
The Potosi factory took advantage abundant silver mined nearby processed silver ingot slug coin
British colony century built factory simply building large number worker gathered perform hand labor usually textile production
This proved efficient administration distribution material individual worker earlier method manufacturing cottage industry system
Cotton mill used invention pioneer industrial factory century precision machine tool replaceable part allowed greater efficiency le waste
This experience formed basis later study manufacturing engineering
Between factory supplanted traditional artisan shop predominant form manufacturing institution
revolutionized factory concept thus manufacturing engineering early century innovation mass production
Highly specialized worker situated alongside series rolling ramp would build product Ford case automobile
This concept dramatically decreased production cost virtually manufactured good brought age consumerism

Many manufacturing company especially industrialized nation begun incorporate CAE program existing design analysis process including solid modeling CAD
This method many benefit including easier exhaustive visualization product ability create virtual assembly part ease use designing mating interface tolerance
Other CAE program commonly used product manufacturer include product life cycle management PLM tool analysis tool used perform complex simulation
Analysis tool may used predict product response expected load including fatigue life manufacturability
These tool include FEA CFD manufacturing CAM
Using CAE program mechanical design team quickly cheaply iterate design process develop product better meet cost performance constraint
No physical prototype need created design nears completion allowing hundred thousand design evaluated instead relatively
In addition CAE analysis program model complicated physical phenomenon solved hand viscoelasticity complex contact mating part flow
Just manufacturing engineering linked discipline mechatronics MDO also used CAE program automate improve iterative design process
MDO tool wrap around existing CAE process allowing product evaluation continue even analyst go home day
They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithm intelligently explore possible design often finding better innovative solution difficult multidisciplinary design problem
Manufacturing engineering extremely important discipline worldwide
It go different name different country
In United States continental European Union commonly known United Kingdom Australia called Manufacturing Engineering Mechanics general sense study force effect matter
Typically engineering mechanic used analyze predict acceleration deformation elastic plastic object known force also called load stress
Subdisciplines mechanic include If engineering project design vehicle static might employed design frame vehicle order evaluate stress intense
Dynamics might used designing car engine evaluate force piston cam engine cycle
Mechanics material might used choose appropriate material manufacture frame engine
Fluid mechanic might used design ventilation system vehicle design intake system engine

In terminology unit roughly corresponds unit symbol form
Examples character include common mark

The concept also includes correspond symbol particular natural language rather bit information used process text one language
Examples control character include well instruction device display otherwise process text
Characters typically combined
Computers communication equipment represent character using assigns character something quantity represented sequence typically transmitted
Two example usual encoding encoding
While character encoding map character number bit sequence instead represents character using series electrical impulse varying length
Historically term widely used industry professional refer often defined programming language
Likewise widely used refer specific repertoire character mapped specific bit sequence numerical code
The term used describe particular visual appearance character
Many computer consist glyph indexed numerical code corresponding character
With advent widespread acceptance Unicode character increasingly seen unit independent particular visual manifestation
The defines member set element used organisation control representation data
Unicode definition supplement explanatory note encourage reader differentiate character grapheme glyph among thing
Such differentiation instance wider theme
For example א often used mathematician denote certain kind also used ordinary Hebrew text
In Unicode two us considered different character two different Unicode numerical identifier though may rendered identically
Conversely water 水 may slightly different appearance text Chinese text local may reflect
But nonetheless Unicode considered character share code point
The Unicode standard also differentiates abstract character paired numeric code facilitate representation computer
The also addressed Unicode
For instance Unicode allocates code point combining trema ï
This make possible code middle character word naïve single code point combination character diacritic LATIN SMALL LETTER I COMBINING DIAERESIS
Both considered canonically equivalent Unicode standard
A data type size exactly one turn defined large enough contain member basic execution character set newer C standard code unit implies minimum size bit
The exact number bit checked via macro
By far common size bit POSIX standard bit
Since requires least bit store single code point usually impossible store one inside single instead encoding must used
Unfortunately fact character historically stored single byte led two term used interchangeably documentation
This often make documentation confusing misleading multibyte encoding used led inefficient incorrect implementation string manipulation function
Modern POSIX documentation attempt fix defining character sequence one byte representing single graphic symbol control code attempt use byte referring char data
However defines array element type char
Unicode also stored string made code unit larger
These called
The original C type called
Due platform defining bit others defining bit recent version added
Even object stored might character instance often stored array
Other language also type
Some use bit like Others use bit order represent value
A word character special meaning aspect computing
A word character within ASCII typically mean letter alphabet upper lower case digit underscore
It might dependent localization encoding use
For example word character French Russian Greek used word fédération Αγορά Примечания

A defined list recognized
Each character represented number
The character set example us number represent English character well special control character
European character set similar ASCII contain additional character European

In computing used represent repertoire kind system
Depending context corresponding resulting code space may regarded natural electrical etc
A character encoding used transmission textual
Character set character map codeset related identical term
Early character code associated optical electrical could represent subset character used written language sometimes restricted upper case letter numeral punctuation
The low cost digital representation data modern computer system allows elaborate character code represent character used many written language
Character encoding using internationally accepted standard permit worldwide interchange text electronic form
Early binary repertoire include encoding Chinese character
Common example character encoding system include American Standard Code Information Interchange
introduced used encode letter character via series long short press
Representations character encoded using Morse code varied length
The encoding created patented modified Donald Murray standardized CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet No
code introduced Army Signal Corps late
encoding scheme used IBM early computer example computer well associated peripheral
BCD extended existing simple numeric encoding include alphabetic special character mapping easily encoding already widespread use
It precursor EBCDIC
introduced encoding scheme used encode letter numeral symbol device code using
usually abbreviated EBCDIC encoding scheme developed
The limitation set soon became apparent number method developed extend
The need support different language including family East Asian script required support far larger number character demanded systematic approach character encoding rather previous ad hoc approach
In trying develop universally interchangeable character encoding researcher faced dilemma one hand seemed necessary add bit accommodate additional character hand user relatively small character set Latin alphabet still constituted majority computer user additional bit colossal waste expensive computing resource would always zeroed user
The compromise solution eventually found developed Unicode break assumption dating back telegraph code character always directly correspond particular sequence bit
Instead character would first mapped universal intermediate representation form abstract number called
Code point would represented variety way various default number bit per character code unit depending context
To encode code point higher length code unit unit solution implement escape sequence would signal subsequent bit parsed higher code point
Terminology related code unit The Latin character set used English European language though Greek character set used Greek language
The character repertoire abstract set one million character found wide variety script including
Other symbol musical notation also included character repertoire
Both Unicode standard character repertoire
As new character added one standard standard also add character maintain parity
The code unit size equivalent bit measurement particular encoding Consider letter abc followed represented
That string contains To express character Unicode hexadecimal value prefixed string
The range valid code point Unicode standard inclusive divided identified number
Characters range plane called BMP
This plane contains character
Characters range plane called
The following table show example code point value A code point represented sequence code unit
The mapping defined encoding
Thus number code unit required represent code point depends encoding parallel standard together constitute modern unified character encoding
Rather mapping character directly octet separately define character available corresponding natural number number encoded series natural number code unit finally unit encoded stream octet
The purpose decomposition establish universal set character encoded variety way
To describe model correctly requires precise term character set character encoding
The term used modern model follow A full set abstract character system support
The repertoire may closed
addition allowed without creating new standard case ASCII series may open allowing addition case Unicode limited extent
The character given repertoire reflect decision made divide writing system basic information unit
The basic variant alphabet broken letter digit punctuation space arranged simple linear sequence displayed order read
But even alphabet pose complication regarded either part single character containing letter diacritic known precomposed character separate character
The former allows far simpler text handling system latter allows combination used text
pose similar problem
Other writing system Arabic Hebrew represented complex character repertoire due need accommodate thing like bidirectional text joined together different way different situation
A CCS map character code point represents one character
For example given repertoire capital letter A Latin alphabet might represented code point character B
Multiple coded character set may share repertoire example IBM code page cover repertoire map different code point
A CEF mapping code point facilitate storage system represents number bit sequence fixed length
practically computer system
For example system store numeric information unit directly represent code point unit larger code point say million could represented using multiple unit
This correspondence defined CEF
Next CES mapping code unit sequence octet facilitate storage file system transmission network
Simple character encoding scheme include compound character encoding scheme switch several simple scheme using compressing scheme try minimise number byte used per code unit
Although simpler CES system working Unicode use either ASCII map Unicode code point sequence octet map Unicode code point sequence word
See detailed discussion
Finally may supply additional information select particular variant character particularly regional variant Unicode character
An example attribute xml lang
The Unicode model us term historical system directly assign sequence character sequence byte covering CCS CEF CES layer
Historically term character encoding character map character set synonymous standard would specify repertoire character encoded stream code unit usually single character per code unit
But term related distinct meaning due effort standard body use precise terminology writing unifying many different encoding system
Regardless term still used interchangeably nearly ubiquitous
A usually mean encoding regard suite encoding covering different script many character share code page
code page suite Windows based IBM DOS based see detail
Most encoding referred code page encoding see byte size
IBM Character Data Representation Architecture CDRA designates coded character set identifier variously called charset character set code page CHARMAP
The term code page occur Unix Linux charmap preferred usually larger context locale
Contrasted character encoding map abstract character
A character set parlance character encoding CCS
encoding term sometimes used characterize old character encoding ambiguity sense
Most use context refers encoding fail cover Unicode code point generally using somewhat different character repertoire several code point representing one Unicode character versa see

Some source refer encoding preceded Unicode
All Windows code page usually referred legacy antedate Unicode unable represent possible Unicode code point
As result many character encoding method use need backward compatibility archived data many computer program developed translate data encoding scheme form data

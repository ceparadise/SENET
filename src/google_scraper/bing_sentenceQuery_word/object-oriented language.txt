In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

use predefined programming modular unit object class subclass forth order make programming faster easier maintain
language help manage complexity large program
Objects package data operation operation publicly accessible internal detail data structure hidden
This information hiding made programming easier allowing programmer think part program isolation
In addition object may derived general one inheriting capability
Such object made possible define specialized object without repeating general one
programming began Simula language added information hiding
Another influential language Smalltalk program set object interacted sending message one another
Since one successful language

based concept may contain form often known code form procedure often known A feature object object procedure access often modify data field object associated object notion self
In OOP computer program designed making object interact one another
There significant diversity OOP language popular one meaning object typically also determine
Many widely used programming language Object Pascal Java Python etc
support programming greater lesser degree typically combination
Significant language include
programming us object associated technique structure supported directly language claim support OOP
The feature listed however common among language considered strongly OOP support notable exception mentioned
support provides ability group procedure file module organizational purpose
Modules code one module accidentally confused procedure variable name another file module
Languages support programming typically use code reuse extensibility form either
Those use class support two main concept Objects sometimes correspond thing found real world
For example graphic program may object circle square menu
An online shopping system might object shopping cart customer product
Sometimes object represent abstract entity like object represents open file object provides service translating measurement customary metric
Each object said particular class example object name field set Mary might instance class Employee
Procedures programming known variable also known member attribute property
This lead following term Objects accessed somewhat like variable complex internal structure many language effectively serving actual reference single instance said object memory within heap stack
They provide layer used separate internal external code
External code use object calling specific instance method certain set input parameter read instance variable write instance variable
Objects created calling special type method class known
A program may create many instance class run operate independently
This easy way procedure used different set data
programming us class sometimes called typically use class
As result significantly different yet analogous terminology used define concept
In language class object composed using concept like
In defined beforehand instantiated based class
If two object instantiated class inherently fruit guaranteed may handle way
programmer expect existence attribute
In primary entity
No even exist
The object another object object linked
Every object one link one
New object created based already existing object chosen prototype
You may call two different object fruit object exists prototype
The idea class exist explicitely object sharing prototype
The attribute method object equivalence class defined prototype
The attribute method individually object may shared object equivalence class
attribute may unexpectedly present
Only implemented prototype
It responsibility object external code select procedural code execute response method call typically looking method run time table associated object
This feature known distinguishes object module fixed static implementation operation instance
If multiple method might run given name known
A method call also known
It conceptualized message name method input parameter passed object dispatch
Encapsulation programming concept bind together data function manipulate data keep safe outside interference misuse
Data encapsulation led important OOP concept
If class allow calling code access internal object data permit access method strong form abstraction information hiding known
Some language Java example let class enforce access restriction explicitly example denoting internal data keyword designating method intended use code outside class keyword
Methods may also designed public private intermediate level allows access class subclass object different class
In language like Python enforced convention example method may name start
Encapsulation prevents external code concerned internal working object
This facilitates example allowing author class change object class represent data internally without changing external code long public method call work way
It also encourages programmer put code concerned certain set data class organizes easy comprehension programmer
Encapsulation technique encourages
Objects contain object instance variable known
For example object Employee class might contain point object Address class addition instance variable like position
Object composition used represent relationship every employee address every Employee object place store Address object
Languages support class almost always support
This allows class arranged hierarchy represents relationship
For example class Employee might inherit class Person
All data method available parent class also appear child class name
For example class Person might define variable method
These also available class Employee might add variable position salary
This technique allows easy procedure data definition addition potentially mirroring relationship intuitive way
Rather utilizing database table programming subroutine developer utilizes object user may familiar object application domain
Subclasses override method defined superclass
allowed language though make resolving override complicated
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class
For example class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide method included class FileReader class WebPageScraper share common parent
instantiated object exist purpose inheritance concrete class instantiated
In Java keyword used prevent class subclassed
The doctrine advocate implementing relationship using composition instead inheritance
For example instead inheriting class Person class Employee could give Employee object internal Person object opportunity hide external code even class Person many public attribute method
Some language like support inheritance
The advocate class function open extension closed modification
another language feature used alternative inheritance
form calling code agnostic whether object belongs parent class one descendant
For example function might call object work whether object class Person class Employee
This another type abstraction simplifies code external class hierarchy enables strong
In language support object method call method object including typically using special variable keyword called
This variable allows method defined one class invoke another method defined later subclass thereof
Terminology invoking object oriented modern sense programming made first appearance late early
In environment group early object could refer identified item atom property attribute later cite detailed understanding LISP internals strong influence thinking
Another early MIT example created glossary technical report based dissertation Sketchpad Sutherland defined notion object instance class concept covered master definition albeit specialized graphical interaction
Also MIT version established direct link data structure plexes dialect procedure prefiguring later termed message method member function
The formal programming concept object introduced major revision Simula I programming language designed created
Simula influenced proposed record class
Simula introduced notion class instance object well subclass virtual procedure coroutines discrete event simulation part explicit programming paradigm
The language also used automatic invented earlier language
Simula used physical modeling model study improve movement ship content cargo port
The idea Simula influenced many later language including Smalltalk derivative LISP
The language developed others introduced term represent pervasive use object message basis computation
Smalltalk creator influenced idea introduced Simula Smalltalk designed fully dynamic system class could created modified dynamically rather statically Simula
Smalltalk OOP introduced wider audience August issue
In Kay Smalltalk work influenced incorporate introduced developer via
Experimentation various extension Lisp LOOPS introducing eventually led integrates functional programming programming allows extension via
In attempt design processor architecture included hardware support object memory successful
Examples include
In produced first design
Focused software quality Eiffel among purely language differs sense language programming language notation supporting entire software lifecycle
Meyer described Eiffel software development method based small number key idea software engineering computer science
Essential quality focus Eiffel Meyer reliability mechanism integral part method language
programming developed dominant programming methodology early mid programming language supporting technique became widely available
These included Visual
Its dominance enhanced rising popularity rely heavily upon programming technique
An example closely related dynamic GUI library OOP language found framework written dynamic messaging extension C based Smalltalk
OOP toolkits also enhanced popularity although concept limited OOP
At colleague also investigating topic although common use earlier
included succeeding design included distinctive approach object orientation class
feature added many previously existing language including
Adding feature language initially designed often led problem compatibility maintainability code
More recently number language emerged primarily also compatible procedural methodology
Two language
Probably commercially important recent language developed well designed Microsoft platform
Each two framework show way benefit using OOP creating abstraction implementation
C support inheritance allowing class defined one language subclass class defined language
generally accepted first language primary feature language
It created making came called object important information representation
another early example one much theory OOP developed
Concerning degree object orientation following distinction made In recent year programming become especially popular
dynamic language built OOP principle adding feature since Perl PHP since version
The document Internet binding popular language
JavaScript perhaps best known language employ cloning prototype rather inheriting class contrast
Another scripting language take approach
The message flow computer request service environment designed linearizations object defined class object known client server
For example simple linearized object would consist length field code point identifying class data value
A complex example would command consisting length code point command value consisting linearized object representing command parameter
Each command must directed server object whose class superclass recognizes command able provide requested service
Clients server best modeled complex structure
DDM took approach used class object define object four level formal hierarchy The initial version DDM defined distributed file service
It later extended foundation DRDA
Challenges design addressed several methodology
Most common known
More broadly term used refer general repeatable solution commonly occurring problem software design
Some commonly occurring problem implication solution particular development
It intuitive assume inheritance creates relationship thus infer object instantiated subclass always used instead instantiated superclass
This intuition unfortunately false OOP language particular allow object
enforced OOP language mutable object guarantee context
Behavioral subtyping undecidable general implemented program compiler
Class object hierarchy must carefully designed considering possible incorrect us detected syntactically
This issue known
influential book published often referred humorously Gang Four
Along exploring capability pitfall programming describes common programming problem pattern solving
As April book printing
The book describes following pattern Both programming RDBMSs extremely common software today
Since store object directly though RDBMSs feature approximate general need bridge two world
The problem bridging programming access data pattern relational database known
There number approach cope problem general solution without downside
One common approach found language library ActiveRecord
There also used replace RDBMSs technically commercially successful RDBMSs
OOP used associate object process digital counterpart
However everyone agrees OOP facilitates direct mapping see section mapping even worthy goal argues program model world model part world Reality cousin twice removed
At time principal limitation OOP noted
For example difficult handle using OOP concept
However popularized adage known Software getting slower rapidly hardware becomes faster said OOP paper Good Ideas Looking Glass This paradigm closely reflects structure system real world therefore well suited model complex system complex behaviour contrast
others noted natural language lack OOP approach strictly prioritizing
This problem may cause OOP suffer convoluted solution procedural programming
OOP developed increase source code
Transparent representation priority meant handled compiler
With increasing relevance parallel hardware developing transparent control flow becomes important something hard achieve OOP
defines class term contract class defined around responsibility information share
This contrasted Wilkerson class defined around must held
The author hold design preferable
mnemonic invented Michael Feathers stand advocate five programming practice General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns another set guideline advocated
The OOP paradigm criticised number reason including meeting stated goal reusability modularity overemphasizing one aspect software design modeling expense important aspect
claimed OOP code intrinsically le efficient procedural code OOP take longer compile OOP language extremely poor modularity property respect class extension modification tend extremely complex
The latter point reiterated principal inventor quoted saying The problem language got implicit environment carry around
You wanted banana got gorilla holding banana entire jungle
A study Potok et al
shown significant difference productivity OOP procedural approach
stated critical comparison OOP technology relational particular difficult lack rigorous definition OOP however Date Darwen proposed theoretical foundation OOP us OOP kind customizable support
In article Lawrence Krubner claimed compared language LISP dialect functional language etc
OOP language unique strength inflict heavy burden unneeded complexity
compare object orientation unfavourably I find OOP technically unsound
It attempt decompose world term interface vary single type
To deal real problem need multisorted algebra family interface span multiple type
I find OOP philosophically unsound
It claim everything object
Even true interesting saying everything object saying nothing
suggested OOP popularity within large company due large frequently changing group mediocre programmer
According Graham discipline imposed OOP prevents one programmer much damage
noted opposed Object Oriented Programming put Nouns first foremost
Why would go length put one part speech pedestal
Why one kind concept take precedence another
It OOP suddenly made verb le important way actually think
It strangely skewed perspective
creator described object system overly simplistic model real world
He emphasized inability OOP model time properly getting increasingly problematic software system become concurrent
programmer advocate critical claim present programming One True Solution written programming language tend encourage thickly layered program destroy transparency
Raymond compare unfavourably approach taken Unix
programmer involved creation called programming computing said OOP language frequently shift focus
Furthermore cite instance professor whose idiomatic solution problem create six new class rather simply use
Objects entity system
They may represent person place bank account table data item program handle
There several attempt formalizing concept used programming
The following concept construct used interpretation OOP concept Attempts find consensus definition theory behind object proven successful however see Abadi Cardelli formal definition many OOP concept construct often diverge widely
For example definition focus mental activity program structuring
One simpler definition OOP act using map data structure array contain function pointer map top
Inheritance performed cloning map sometimes called prototyping

language OOL computer programming language implement object associated procedure within programming context create software program
language us programming technique bind related data function object encourages reuse object within program
language primarily designed reduce complexity typical procedural language data binding encapsulation technique
In language object created provide limited access function method within program

Programming language language programmer writes instruction computer ultimately execute
The earliest programming language far removed instruction directly executed hardware
Users soon beginning invented convenient language
The early language FORTRAN Formula Translator originally much like assembly language however allowed programmer write algebraic expression instead coded instruction operation
As learning program computer became increasingly important stripped basic version FORTRAN called Beginner Symbolic Instruction Code written John Kemeny Thomas Kurtz Hanover teach novice simple programming skill
BASIC quickly spread academic institution beginning version BASIC personal computer allowed even student elementary school learn fundamental programming
At roughly time FORTRAN created COBOL Common Language developed handle record file operation necessary simple business application
The trend since toward developing increasingly abstract language allowing programmer think communicate machine level ever remote
COBOL FORTRAN descendant Pascal C known imperative language since specify sequence explicit command machine go solving problem hand different take place machine level
Other language sense programming done calling invoking function procedure section executed within program
The language type List Processing computation expressed application one Since LISP object may function well individual data item variable mathematical terminology data structure see section programmer create function appropriate level abstraction solve problem hand
This feature made LISP popular language application although somewhat superseded Programming Logic
These termed declarative language sense programmer specifies goal accomplished specific method applied attain goal
Prolog based concept resolution akin logical deduction unification similar pattern matching
Programs language written sequence goal
A recent extension logic programming constraint logic programming pattern matching replaced general operation constraint satisfaction
Again program sequence goal attained case satisfaction specified constraint
An important trend programming language support data encapsulation code
Data encapsulation best illustrated language programming done term object
An object Smalltalk similar language consists data together procedure program segment operate data
Encapsulation refers fact object data accessed method procedure provided
Programming done creating object send message one another task accomplished cooperatively others method
This influential
For example language C popular application system development largely supplanted extension
An version BASIC named available personal computer allows even novice programmer create interactive application elegant GUIs
In introduced yet another language
Applications written Java translated particular machine language intermediate language called Java Bytecode may executed computer using UNIX Macintosh Windows operating system Java interpretation program known Java virtual machine
See
Thus Java ideal creating distributed application application
The application reside server Bytecode form readily downloaded executed Java virtual machine
In many case desirable download entire application interface client may communicate interactively application
Java applet small chunk application code solve problem
Residing server may downloaded run standard provide example client interface game residing server
Concurrency refers execution one procedure time perhaps access shared data either truly simultaneously multiprocessor unpredictably interleaved manner
Languages standard application language include encapsulation feature allow programmer specify rule interaction procedure task
At still higher level abstraction lie visual programming language programmer graphically express want done mean icon represent data object process arrow represent data flow sequencing operation
As yet none visual programming language found wide commercial acceptance
On hand language much successful example language like sophisticated may easily expressed fourth generation language allow user express request data simple command
For example query Select salary payroll employee Jones written database language SQL easily understood reader
The language HyperText Markup Language allows nonprogrammers design Web page specifying structure content leaf detailed presentation extraction information client Web browser
Computer program written language machine language must either interpreted compiled
An software examines one instruction time call code execute operation required instruction
This rather slow process
A software translates computer program whole machine code saved subsequent execution whenever desired
Much work done making process compiled code efficient possible
When new language developed usually first interpreted
If language becomes popular becomes important write compiler although may task considerable difficulty
There intermediate approach compile code machine language intermediate language close enough machine language efficient close tied machine language particular computer
It use approach provides Java language independence

refers type computer programming software design define also type operation applied data structure
In way data structure becomes includes function
In addition programmer create relationship one object another
For example object inherit characteristic object
If new programming language need know basic get started code
The following Webopedia definition help better understand programming One principal advantage programming technique procedural programming technique enable programmer create need changed new type object added
A programmer simply create new object inherits many existing object
This make program easier modify

Computer science within purview study theory design implementation performance computer computer software including study computability computation
In ACM IEEE say Computer science span wide range theoretical algorithmic foundation development robotics computer vision intelligent system bioinformatics exciting area
We think work computer scientist falling three category
They design implement software
Computer scientist take challenging programming job
They also supervise programmer keeping aware new approach
They devise new way use computer
Progress CS area networking database enabled development World Wide Web
Now CS researcher working scientist field make robot become practical intelligent aide use database create new knowledge use computer help decipher secret DNA
They develop effective way solve computing problem
For example computer scientist develop best possible way store information database send data network display complex image

Computer science span range theory programming
Curricula reflect breadth sometimes criticized failing prepare graduate specific job
While discipline may produce graduate immediately relevant skill computer science offer comprehensive foundation permit graduate adapt new technology new idea
A recommended Computer Science Curricula published prepared The Joint Task Force Computing Curricula Association Computing Machinery ACM IEEE Computer Society published
Computer engineering hand concerned computer hardware design design device system general computing general computing system
The ACM IEEE say Computer engineering concerned design construction computer system
It involves study hardware software communication interaction among
Its curriculum focus theory principle practice traditional electrical engineering mathematics applies problem designing computer device
Computer engineering student study design digital hardware system including communication system computer device contain computer
They study software development focusing software digital device interface user device
CE study may emphasize hardware software may balanced emphasis
CE strong engineering flavor
Currently dominant area within computing engineering embedded system development device software hardware embedded

accessed There often legitimate overlap CS CE
For example quite common computer architecture taught studied CE CS UMaine
It also common neural network computer vision robotics involving primarily hardware solution CE department also case UMaine
VLSI design hand would reasonable find computer science department one would expect find basic computer science discipline CE IS AI graphic visualization computing apart hardware consideration computer network database system apart application software engineering forth
Information system specialist focus integrating information technology solution business process meet information need business enterprise enabling achieve objective effective efficient way
This discipline perspective information technology emphasizes information view technology instrument generating processing distributing information
Professionals discipline primarily concerned information computer system provide aid enterprise defining achieving goal process enterprise implement improve using information technology
A majority Information Systems IS program located business school
All IS degree combine business computing coursework
A variety IS program exist various label often reflect nature program
For example program Computer Information Systems usually strongest technology focus program Management Information Systems emphasize organizational behavioral aspect IS
Degree program name always consistent
A fourth area campus New Media computing discipline rather overlap computing user computer technology The New Media Program University Maine offer interdisciplinary course study system technology history design theory information
The curriculum enables student investigate creative applied process essential area study
It prepares student technologically capable articulate thinker creative medium professional
UMaine New Media Web site There confusion another area computing information technology
Note information technology IT differs meaning term used UMaine Strategic Plan author essentially mean The ACM IEEE differentiate IS IT follows
Whereas perspective IS emphasizes information technology viewed instrument generating processing distributing information Information Technology emphasize technology information conveys
IT new rapidly growing field started grassroots response practical everyday need business organization
Today organization every kind dependent information technology
They need appropriate system place
These system must work properly secure upgraded maintained replaced appropriate
Employees throughout organization require support IT staff understand computer system software committed solving whatever problem might
Graduates information technology program address need
Degree program information technology arose degree program computing discipline producing adequate supply graduate capable handling real need
IT program exist produce graduate posse right combination knowledge practical expertise take care organization information technology infrastructure people use
IT specialist assume responsibility selecting hardware software product appropriate organization integrating product organizational need infrastructure installing customizing maintaining application organization computer user
Examples responsibility include installation network network administration security design web page development multimedia resource installation communication component oversight email system planning management technology lifecycle organization technology maintained upgraded replaced
Information technology represented UMaine campus
There fact question suitability major university opposed technical college campus
There additional confusion term information This original sense refers specific field study property information per se example Shannon work information theory
The term sometimes used synonymously computing come mean academic study information representation storage use opposed addition computational manipulation information
The School Computing Information Science home information science UMaine
In addition computer science School strong emphasis information science research graduate education particular area geographical information science

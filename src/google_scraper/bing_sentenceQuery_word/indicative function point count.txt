learn share knowledge build career
One topic seems come regularly mailing list online discussion merit lack thereof Computer Science Degree
An argument seems come time negative party coding number year never used recursion
So question This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built
By way Mario typical name ArrangeString function join I surprised language choice already implementation
Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division
In English definition say greatest common divisor number zero number greatest common divisor two number greatest common divisor remainder dividing
If like know work see Wikipedia article
Let compute gcd example
Each step equal one In first step equal zero second part definition applies
mod go remainder
At step second part applies time mod divide remainder
At step second argument answer
Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood
EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

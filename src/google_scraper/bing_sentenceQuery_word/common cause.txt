This collaborative venture received Canada Quebec Entente funding academic year given strategy prove effective could serve model technical program
The crux project introduce career IT field grade student parent
To end plan produce number video highlighting different type work graduate perform workplace
A web site set place high school student parent learn IT
Each college mount interactive IT event aimed student raise awareness IT
There special emphasis woman minority IT field
What experience taught date value networking
I know department Computer Science around province acted unison wo easily drift apart
Using IT coordinate activity prove beneficial

Web security vexing problem malicious software made headline last week computer antivirus software maker McAfee sent botched update crashed thousand computer around world
Such hiccup computer security software rare
What rare damage caused malicious software known malware designed thwart
Last year hacker stole approximately million credit card number according Internet Security Threat Report released month security software maker Symantec
And third quarter alone million reported loss due online banking fraud
David Perry global director education security software maker Trend Micro veteran fighting malware
He gave TechNewsDaily guided tour malware trinity three likely source malware infection
Ground Zero Internet
The Web far common vector malware infection Perry said
The universal thing involved cyber bad guy activity Web
Users even click anything website infect computer
Just looking enough
Look web page Bang infected without much said
Forsaking Internet Explorer replacing another browser Firefox wo give much protection either Perry said
Malware basically equal opportunity come browser browser
A Trojan downloader common malicious software get hit said
A Trojan program pretend something really downloader program downloads another program
It like Robin Hood Perry said
He shot arrow string tree branch
He used string drag rope rope drag basket stuff
In past site devoted porn usual suspect source infection
It used true longer Perry said
We seen government agency Roman Catholic Church get infected seen railroad airline British Museum get infected
There safe web To make matter worse infected computer often asymptomatic appear functioning normally
Many Trojan virus slow computer make cursor go crazy
Like high blood pressure malware silent killer
Unfortunately big cognitive disconnect part user seen movie virus come screen announces infecting Perry said
Any malware see today design symptom free possibly make
The web also risk contracting bot infection enlist computer agent fraudster arsenal
A botnet collection infected PCs bad guy Perry said
Botnets source spam used ID theft extortion industrial espionage finding web page infect
I would call Swiss Army Knife malware world
It lot thing lot people
Like majority malware software botnets asymptomatic
Until wake find bank account drained discover ID appropriated use someone else
Fake antivirus program often referred scareware third arguably irritating leg malware stool
With scareware warning pop computer screen telling computer infected attempt sell program disinfect program
This ultimate situation
If click anywhere warning get infected
If ignore warning never go away
And fall ruse buy fake antivirus program computer become another warrior scammer botnet army
This one thing world malware visible Perry said
If infected know visible bug time
If think simply hit keyboard combination brings Task Manager Windows rid shut offending program think
Many malware programmer expect panicked user create fake Task Manager window trigger infection
So big problem
Over new Trojan downloaders created every day Perry said
Most computer user knowledgeable enough deal problem without help added
It vast pervasive
The best defense said install suite Internet security software religiously update
For right count change watch Ps Qs said
There way easily tell something wrong going Internet
If like learn do sand practicing safe computing good place start list security tip McAfee Threat Center

Computer virus come long way early day personal computer teenage hacker competed bragging right creating malware designed mischief random mayhem
Now hacker gone professional ambition grown rather amateur working parent basement malware creator often part underworld criminal gang working directly foreign government intelligence agency
As stake grown potential damage destruction brought malware
The arrival Stuxnet like cartoon villain come life first computer virus designed specifically cause damage real opposed virtual world
While previous malware program may caused secondary physical problem Stuxnet unique targeted software control industrial system
Specifically Stuxnet designed damage machinery Iran uranium enrichment facility Natanz
Based available information including data International Atomic Energy Agency expert believe Stuxnet caused large number Iran giant washing machine used enrich spin control
Though Stuxnet discovered believed first infected computer Iran
In new computer worm crawled way million PCs around world creating massive botnet army remotely controlled computer capable stealing financial data information
Its complexity made difficult stop virus prompted creation coalition expert dedicated stopping spread
At height Conficker worm infected million computer leading researcher call super bug super But real mystery Conficker still infects large number computer one know meant botnet army never used specific purpose best anyone knowledge
Conficker real purpose still confounds security expert
This piece malware claim fame temporarily forced Pentagon issue blanket ban thumb drive even contributed creation entirely new military department Cyber Command
spread infected thumb drive installing malware steal data
When found Pentagon computer official suspected work foreign spy
Former Deputy Secretary Defense William Lynne later wrote created digital beachhead data could transferred server foreign Though expert disputed contention virus creation foreign intelligence agency effect make cyber war formal part military strategy
There shortage malware kit target personal information Zeus become tool many today cyber criminal readily available sale cyber crime underworld
It used pilfer password well file helping create literal underground economy compromised identity bought sold little cent
In age Internet banking online shopping compromised identity much name social security number address date birth mother maiden name even secret security question first pet favorite teacher best friend grade school
PoisonIvy computer security nightmare allows attacker secretly control infected user computer
Malware like PoisonIvy known remote access trojan provides full control perpetrator backdoor
Once virus installed perpetrator activate control targeted computer record manipulate content even use computer speaker webcam record audio video
Once thought tool amateur hacker PoisonIvy used sophisticated attack dozen Western firm including involved defense chemical industry written Symantec computer security firm
The attack traced back China
MyDoom muscled way malware world quickly infecting one million computer launching massive distributed denial service attack overwhelms target flooding information multiple system
The virus spread email appeared bounced message
When unsuspecting victim opened email malicious code downloaded pilfered new victim Outlook address book
From spread victim friend family colleague
MyDoom spread faster worm seen prior
By many worm spreading Fizzer entirely new creature
If earlier worm like Code Red see mischief Fizzer money
While initially dismissed seriousness worm fast moving Code Red Fizzer insidious
What make Fizzer stand first instance worm created financial gain say Roel Schouwenberg senior researcher Kaspersky company
Computers infected Fizzer started sending pharmacy In word Fizzer take address book spread sake spreading used address book send familiar porn pill spam
Fizzer followed worm like SoBig became threatening enough Microsoft even offered bounty information leading arrest creator
In January Slammer proved Internet worm could disrupt private public service harbinger future mayhem
Slammer work releasing deluge network packet unit data transmitted Internet bringing Internet many server near screeching halt
Through classic denial service attack Slammer quite real effect key service
Among list victim Bank America ATMs emergency response system Washington State perhaps disturbingly
Compared modern malware Code Red seems like almost kinder gentler version threat
But swept across computer worldwide caught security expert guard exploiting flaw Perhaps memorably Code Red successfully brought website forced government agency temporarily take public website well
Though later worm since overshadowed Code Red still remembered expert turning point malware rapid spread
Back million people made mistake opening innocent looking email attachment labeled simply I Love Instead revealing heartfelt confession secret admirer perhaps reader hoped file unleashed malicious program overwrote user image file
Then like chain letter gone nuclear virus first contact user Windows address book
While today standard Love Letter almost quaint cause problem computer user
It took hour Love Letter become global pandemic part played fundamental human emotion desire loved
In sense Love Letter could considered first socially engineered computer virus

Preprint My dissertation written supervision Tomasz Placek Institute Philosophy Jagiellonian University Kraków
In one basic informal shape principle common cause state surprising correlation two factor believed directly influence one another due possibly hidden common cause
Here concerned version od idea posse purely probabilistic formulation
It introduced form general principle Hans Reichenbach posthumously published book The Direction Time
The central notion principle Reichenbach formulation current essay screening two correlated event screened third event conditioning third event make probabilistically independent
Reichenbach principle mark also beginning new field philosophy namely probabilistic causality
For part current essay seen effort checking far one go purely statistical notion revolving around Reichenbach idea common cause
In short answer surprisingly far class probability space correlation interesting
logically independent formally defined chapter event posse explanation sort
However fact lends opposing interpretation conclusion
Chapters contain mathematical result concerning issue
The condition requires equality probabilistic nature hold chapter short discussion slightly weakened version condition hold side mentioned equality differ small degree
In chapter mathematical preliminary study various formulation principle might said stem original idea Reichenbach
We also examine salient counterargument undermine least formulation
Chapter formal nature dealing various probabilistic notion thought generalization Reichenbach concept common cause
The next chapter concern relationship idea common causal explanation Bell inequality
In chapter briefly present form Reichenbach principle found field representing causal structure mean directed acyclic graph

What difference associative entity associative relationship attribute
In book titled Modern Database Management Hoffer edition author state difference two
Though really explain difference instead give example different
From I gather relationship attribute associated associative relationship attribute denoted dashed line rectangle attribute inside rectangle
Whereas associative entity attribute describe relationship
Both used relationship ER diagramming
Is thought process correct
Edit Also I forgot mention associative entity also attribute unique identifier least I think
An table associate two table many many relationship
An associative relationship attribute attribute associative entity exists many many relationship
Here example
Let suppose following table
Ok many many relationship User Permission
A user one permission permission shared many user
So create associative entity
The permission granted time stamp associative relationship attribute
It would fit User table Permission table
It attribute association
In ER diagramming M N relationship associative entity OR single associative attribute describe relationship
The difference associative entity must unique identifier associative attribute
According book associative entity must By posting answer agree

Difference Between Things Terms Objects Posted modeling ERM technique widely used modeling database
modeling process coming abstract conceptual representation data
One main building block ERM entity
Entity represents real world object thing stand independently identified uniquely
Attributes property entity
ER diagram product modeling
ER diagram drawn using entity attribute symbol relationship
An entity represents thing exist independently identified uniquely
More specifically entity often represents class group category similar object
Most often entity represents real world object car employee
Entities though noun come description problem solved
Entities represented table relational database
In general entity map exactly one table database
Individual row table correspond actual instance represented entity
For example Employee database row corresponds record individual employee company
In modeling property entity called attribute
In word attribute represent sub group information object represented entity
Attributes define individual instance help differentiate instance describing characteristic
It important note attribute atomic
In relational database entity realized table column represents attribute entity
For example Employee table column department rank salary example attribute employee
In order differentiate individual instance entity one attribute field unique value instance selected key
For example social security number attribute unique employee often used primary key Employee table
Sometimes multiple attribute makeup primary key well
In modeling entity represent real world identified unique independent attribute represent property entity
In relational database entity become table row representing individual instance whereas attribute become column corresponding table
When designing database common confusion choosing entity attribute represent certain real word object
For example address employee represented attribute another entity connected employee entity relationship
A general rule thumb employee one address address must entity attribute
Similarly structure address important capture address entity attribute atomic

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In general entity pronounced existing real thing
The word root Latin make distinction thing existence quality
An entity exists need entity
The fact something exists also seems connote separateness existence entity
In programming engineering probably many context word used identify unit whether concrete thing abstract idea ready name label
In blackboard discussion one draw something yet unnamed refer drawing representation entity
If entity discussed later get ascribed quality name reference entity may longer useful
In usage entity close meaning used
Here usage know In Standard Generalized Markup Language entity specific character string effect causing formatting program print formatter Web browser format display screen select present particular character notation
In usage entity certain string character together specify unique font selected displayed printed
A word needed character string entity came handy
In HTML usage SGML special entity character string given name entity therefore called named entity
In relation entity single person place thing data stored
In first step creation database entity unit data classified stated relationship entity
In Open Systems Interconnection model network communication entity active element within subsystem communicates entity using defined protocol
In IBM security product entity user group resource defined RACF
In almost every program element referred entity procedure operator interface block unit symbolic constant statement label

An describes thing interest specific domain knowledge
An ER model composed entity type classify thing interest specifies relationship exist instance entity type
In ER model commonly formed represent thing business need remember order perform business process
Consequently ER model becomes abstract defines data information structure implemented typically
modeling developed database design published paper
However variant idea existed previously
Some ER modeler show super subtype entity connected relationship ER model used also specification
An model usually result systematic analysis define describe important process area business
It define business process present business data schema graphical form
It usually drawn graphical form box connected line express association dependency entity
An ER model also expressed verbal form example Entities may characterized relationship also additional property include identifier called primary key
Diagrams created represent attribute well entity relationship may called diagram rather model
An ER model typically implemented
In simple relational database implementation row table represents one instance entity type field table represents attribute type
In relationship entity implemented storing primary key one entity pointer foreign key table another entity There tradition model built two three level abstraction
Note hierarchy used kind specification different
The first stage design us model describe information need type stored
The technique used describe
overview classification used term relationship certain
In case design information system based database later stage usually called logical design mapped turn mapped physical model physical design
Note sometimes phase referred physical design
An may defined thing capable independent existence uniquely identified
An entity abstraction complexity domain
When speak entity normally speak aspect real world distinguished aspect real world
An entity thing exists either physically logically
An entity may physical object house car exist physically event house sale car service concept customer transaction order exist concept
Although term entity one commonly used following Chen really distinguish entity
An category
An entity strictly speaking instance given
There usually many instance
Because term somewhat cumbersome people tend use term entity synonym term
Entities thought
Examples computer employee song mathematical theorem
A relationship capture entity related one another
Relationships thought linking two noun
Examples relationship company computer relationship employee department relationship artist song relationship mathematician conjecture
The model linguistic aspect described utilized database ERROL mimic construct
ERROL implementation based RRA relational algebra adapted model capture linguistic aspect
Entities relationship attribute
Examples entity might SSN attribute relationship may attribute
Every entity unless must minimal set uniquely identifying attribute called entity
diagram show single entity single instance relation
Rather show entity set entity entity type relationship set relationship relationship type
Example particular entity
The collection song database entity set
The relationship child lunch single relationship
The set relationship database relationship set
In word relationship set corresponds relationship corresponds member relation
Certain relationship set may indicated well
Chen proposed following rule thumb mapping natural language description ER diagram Peter Chen
Physical view show data actually stored
In Chen original paper give example relationship role
He describes relationship marriage two role husband wife
A person play role husband marriage relationship another person play role wife marriage
These word noun
That surprise naming thing requires noun
Chen terminology also applied earlier idea
The line arrow diagram owes earlier Chen relationship diagram
Another common extension Chen model name relationship role verb phrase
It also become prevalent name role phrase
Correct noun case
Thus rather etc
The use noun direct benefit generating physical implementation semantic model
When two relationship possible generate name immediately meaningful
Modifications original specification beneficial
Chen described
As aside notation used Oracle Designer us minimum cardinality analogous optionality role maximum cardinality crow foot
In Elmasri Navathe others preference role minimum maximum cardinality
Recent researcher Feinerer Dullea et al
shown coherent applied relationship order greater
In Dullea et al
one read A across notation used UML effectively represent semantics participation constraint imposed relationship degree higher binary
In Feinerer say Problems arise operate semantics used UML association
Hartmann investigates situation show different transformation fail
also As see next page interpretation introduces several difficulty prevent extension simple mechanism binary association
Chen notation modeling us rectangle represent entity set diamond represent relationship appropriate attribute relationship
If entity set participates relationship set connected line
Attributes drawn oval connected line exactly one entity relationship set
Cardinality constraint expressed follows Attributes often omitted clutter diagram diagram technique often list entity attribute within rectangle drawn entity set
Related diagramming convention technique Crow foot notation beginning date back article Gordon Everest used SSADM
Crow foot diagram represent entity box relationship line box
Different shape end line represent cardinality relationship
Crow foot notation used consultancy practice
Many consultant CACI including Richard Barker subsequently moved UK developed early version Oracle tool introducing notation wider audience
With notation relationship attribute
Where necessary relationship promoted entity right example necessary capture artist performed song new entity performance introduced attribute reflecting time place relationship artist song becomes indirect relationship via performance
In using modeled database user encounter two well known issue returned result mean something result assumed query author
The first trap
It occurs master table linking multiple table relationship
The issue derives name way model look draw diagram linked table master table
This type model look similar type model used
When trying calculate sum aggregate using standard SQL master table get unexpected incorrect result explanation missing
The solution either adjust model SQL
This issue occurs mostly database decision support system software query system sometimes includes specific method handling issue
The second issue trap
A chasm trap occurs model suggests existence relationship entity type pathway exist certain entity occurrence
For example Building Rooms hold Computers
You would expect able query model see Computers Building
However Computers currently assigned Room repair somewhere else shown list
You need another relation Building Computers capture computer building
This last modelling issue result failure capture relationship exist real world model
See detail
A semantic model model concept sometimes called platform independent model
It intensional model
At latest since well known An extensional model one map element particular methodology technology thus platform specific model
The UML specification explicitly state association class model extensional fact considering extensive array additional adornment provided specification provided prior candidate semantic modelling language
Peter Chen father ER modeling said seminal paper In original article Chen explicitly contrast diagram record modelling technique Several author also support Chen program Chen accord philosophic theoretical tradition time Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates Plato Aristotle BC modern
associate knowledge apprehension unchanging Forms The form according Socrates roughly speaking archetype abstract representation many type thing property relationship one another

Attribute Definition A property characteristic
For example attribute person would name age height etc Search Attribute UK US Search Attribute rest Computing Students

Relational database allow data separated connected across several table
Tables connected primary foreign key increase efficiency
The main characteristic When working relational database user need try keep
Each entity primary key provide unique reference entity mean entity referenced another table without call detail entity
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
Matt Clark explains BBC Sport us relational database store access information appears website Entities relate three different way You represent relationship using entity relationship diagram ERD
For example person address
For example cinema customer

In science measurement collection quantitative numerical data describes property object event
A measurement made comparing quantity
Since comparison perfect measurement inherently include much measured value deviate true value
The study measurement called metrology
There many measurement system used throughout history across world progress made since century setting international standard
The modern SI base type physical measurement
Measuring volume cup water Erlenmeyer flask give better measurement trying gauge volume putting bucket even measurement reported using unit milliliter
So criterion scientist used compare measurement type magnitude unit
The level type methodology used taking measurement
Magnitude actual numerical value measurement
Unit ratio number standard quantity gram candela micrometer
Uncertainty reflects systematic random error measurement
Uncertainty description confidence accuracy precision measurement typically expressed error
Measurements calibrated say compared set standard system measuring device deliver value match another person would obtain measurement repeated
There common standard system may encounter SI come French name It commonly used metric system
SI specific metric system decimal system measurement
Examples two common form metric system MKS system meter kilogram second base unit CGS system centimeter gram second base unit
There many unit SI form metric system built upon combination base unit
These called derived unit The British Imperial system measurement common SI unit adopted
Although Britain largely adopted SI system United States Caribbean country still use English system
This system based unit unit length mass time

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

Tutorials External Resources If router one route found two different routing protocol destination network router chooses choose best one
But case two path found protocol destination network
Here use Route Metric value find best path
us hop count metric
Hop count number router data must pas source network reach destination
Hop Count Number Routers data must pas source network reach destination
Click following link know
Consider network topology
Here two path reach Destination Network Source Network Path Path
For best path path least Hop Count Path
But consider Bandwidth connecting link Mbps Bandwidth along Path far le Mbps Bandwidth along Path practically better send traffic via Path even one Hop cross
consider Distance Hop count Source Network Destination Network find best path
Other factor like Bandwidth connecting link Delay etc ignored selecting best path
us complex equation find Route Metric value
consider following network performance related attribute calculate EIGRP metric value
Bandwidth Delay Reliability Load EIGRP Metric Reliability By default value set set
Hence equation deduced EIGRP Metric Bandwidth Delay Click following link know Metric
Metric value also known OSPF Cost Value
OSPF cost value particular route path accumulated cost send packet source network destination network using route
The cost interface inversely proportional bandwidth interface
Higher bandwidth interface lower cost low bandwidth interface higher word cost sending data Mbps WAN link higher Mbps WAN link
OSPF us reference bandwith Mbps calculate cost value
The formula used calculate cost Mbps converted Bps Bandwidth link Bps
If router Mbps WAN Link cost value link Following factor choose best path destination
Bandwidth The bandwidth link Kbps Cost Measurement inverse bandwidth link Delay IP EIGRP IP IGRP Time take reach destination Hop count How many router away destination Load IP EIGRP IP IGRP The path least utilization Reliability IP EIGRP IP IGRP The path least amount error downtime If router found multiple path value Metric value destination load balancing occur
Cisco IOS Software limit six route routing table protocol set limitation
For example allows four route
For almost route least metric considered best route

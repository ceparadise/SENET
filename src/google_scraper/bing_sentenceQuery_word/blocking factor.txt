What term block mean wrt computer science
I seen used multiple occassions never understood mean
Like blocking
Googling seem help much
Blocking mean program essentially asks Get data I wait ready
This contrast
There two flavor Get data I going go something else
Interrupt data ready
Get data I going go something else
I ask later yet
It important program block waiting data ca thing like respond mouse click repaint screen
This happening see program labeled Not Responding task manager
In summary mean process hang wait completes
cover passing focussing block progress program communication progress leaving system resource idle
When program make many operation mean processor spend almost time idle waiting operation complete Of course help much next step something data
Blocking simpler move obvious way You ca since involves setting object connection fed single multiplexor constantly look next thing come
Imagine two approach different thousand million connection
You choose one factor like For example problem blocking holding several thousand connection open one thread system like several thousand thread
But turn fairly complex issue
Read perception including PDF
In addition indicating programming context also mean
First meaning block easy computer science block source code computer language
For perl etc
curly bracket block code delimits block code
Python use indentation block
The second meaning used context operating system usually called kernel seen supreme manager manages resource
When different process thread ask system call resource CPU disk network memory resource may available due multiple competing thread process asking thing
The kernel put process thread suspension wait queue allowing process thread working resource execution state
The suspended process blocking state blocked
Blocking achieve either hardware software mechanism operating system
The running process also ask operating system suspend execution sleep command Shell perl

What blocking factor DBMS The bit I looked said floored value block per record floor B block size R record
I wondering someone tell main reason used also whether actually FLOORED
My understanding FLOORED get floored anyone wondering
A block smallest unit data underlying storage system hdd san f etc willing deal
It size traditionally byte hard drive
It floored half record would fit one store record per block
Blocking factor pretty heavily used many dbms related calculation
For example We record
Each record byte long
Each record contains unique key Lets say social security number
We want looking someone social security number fast
We need something measure performance
The thing take time asking block harddisk
You know mechanical device
It reposition head blabla really slow operation compared fast CPU compared fast operative memory RAM access
Okay let say measure performance operation many disk access take
We want minimize number disk access
Okay know tell something slow fast
Many disk access bad Very disk access good Lets say imaginary hw block byte
We want calculate many block need
First need know many record fit single block And record need block store data
If one read block find single record key social security number would take disk access
Not good
We better
Lets build index file
We build
A sparse index database file pair key pointer every block data file
Every key file associated particular pointer block sorted data file
In clustered index duplicate key sparse index point lowest search key block
Okay pointer key index file block
Lets say imaginary hw pointer byte long imaginary world social security number key take byte
So going store one byte long pair block index
How many pair fit single block
mean pair fit single block
And need store index file take block The index file ordered key binary search find pointer block contains record
Doing binary search index file cost disk acceses
We also need disk access actually read data block index record point
Okay see blocking factor heavy used example calculation

I two question notion block experimental design What difference block factor
I tried read book something clear seems author always assume interaction block factor factor
Is right
The block factor
The main aim blocking reduce unexplained variation Residual design
We interested block effect rather block suspect background noise would counfound effect actual factor
We group experimental unit homogeneous block level main factor equally represented
The analysis variance Randomized Control Block design split residual term equivalent single factor Complete Randomized design block residual component
We note however latter component fewer degree freedom single factor CR design leading higher estimate Residual Residual
The decision block block made reckon decrease residual compensate decrease
Usually additive model fitted RCB design data response variable additive combination factor block effect assumed interaction exists two
I think accounted fact RCB enable u tell apart interaction BxF within Block variability variability within experimental unit
The bottom line assume interaction since ca measure
We test whether present either visually Tukey test though
A good resource experimental design
Here concise answer
A lot detail example might found document treating design experiment especially agronomy
Often researcher interested block effect per se want account variability response block
So I use view block factor particular role
Of note block effect typically considered random effect
Finally expect effect differ block block interaction considered
bread dough baking temperature affect tastiness bread
You rating scale tastiness
And let say purchasing packaged bread dough food company rather mixing
Each baked loaf bread experimental unit
Let say dough temperature fit loaf bread oven want run loaf
In factorial layout block would completely randomly decide order bread baked
For loaf would preheat oven open package bread dough bake
This would involve running oven time loaf bread
Alternatively could treat
In case would run oven time might make data collection faster
Each oven run would four loaf necessarily two dough type
The exact proportion would chosen randomly
You would oven run temperature could help account variability among oven run
Even fancier could well oven run
In design would exactly two type dough oven run
When I time think I update appropriate fancy name experiment design
Experimental design combination three structure Blocks factor belong design structure distinguish bad idea call blocking factor v treatment factor
They good example model parameter whose presence must account whose value particularly interesting
Please note nothing nature factor blocking factor may fixed random treatment factor may fixed random
My personal rule thumb regarding factor belongs experimental design If I want estimate parameter associated factor compare either within factor factor parameter belongs treatment structure
If I care value associated parameter care compare factor belongs design structure
Thus elsewhere thread I worry difference
But I care compare Run v Run
Oven run belongs
I want compare two dough recipe recipe belongs treatment structure
I care oven temperature belongs treatment structure
Let build Experimental Design
The Design Structure one factor oven run Run Treatment Structure two factor Recipe Temperature
Because every run single nominal temperature Temperature Run must occur level experimental design
However space loaf Run
Obviously choose bake loaf per run
If bake one loaf per run randomize order Recipe presentation get Completely Randomized Design CRD Structure
If bake two loaf one Recipe per Run Randomized Complete Block Design RCB Structure
Please note important Recipe occur within Run
Without balance Recipe comparison contaminated Run difference
Remember goal blocking
If bake three loaf per Run would probably crazy factor one two block
The reasonable possibility four loaf per Run
In case would bake two loaf recipe Run
Again RCB Structure
We estimate variability using difference two loaf Recipe Run
If choose one RCB Design Structures Temperature effect completely randomized Run level
Recipe nested within temperature different error structure temperature dough appears within run
The contrast looking recipe recipe dough interaction variability
Technically called variously design structure design structure
Which would investigator use
Probably RCB four loaf run v v carry lot weight
However modified concern home oven rather industrial production may well reason use CRD believed home baker rarely bake multiple loaf
I think time matter convention likely proper field
I think medical context two factor anova one factor almost always called treatment block
Typically ocram say block effect random effect I think systematic
Let say want ass effectiveness different medical treatment First design patient take one treatment efficiency measured appropriate scale
You suspect sex patient interest block male block female patient
In case block factor fixed effect
Second design patient try treatment different moment
As variability patient consider patient block
You interested existence variability population value particular patient
In case block factor random effect
Well I teach stuff trying stick convention domain France I got textbook I never participated clinical trial want two cent

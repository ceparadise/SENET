UML stand
They diagram help aid creation visualisation documentation various aspect software engineering process
For requirement use
Use Cases come pair An Actor something performs use case upon system
An Actor entity meaning Human artefact directly play role system long either directly use system used system
For Use Case know entry condition precondition Exit condition So basically What true Use Case What true Use Case
A use case software engineering description system behavior responds request originates outside system
In word use case describes system question
The use case technique used capture system behavioral requirement detailing thread functional requirement
So let quick look Use Case diagram look like This Use Case Library System
It fairly identical one found book page Figure want study little Here see Actors system Library Users Library Staff Suppliers
And Use Case Diagrams Actors MUST represented stick people
Each class interaction system represented named eclipse placed inside box also named
This name name system eg Library System
What diagram show Library user member public search article print using system
A member Library Staff see Catalogue service get book stock top Library Users Staff User Administration privilege
The final actor Suppler interact Catalogue Service user administration privilege since supply book required Library
A Use Case description detailed description class interaction within given Use Case Diagram So quick example Use Case Description say Article Search would something like Computer Scientist Games Developer DevOps Engineer
Fantasy book lover also founder Cadaeic Studios

A use case software system engineering term describes user us system accomplish particular goal
A use case act software modeling technique defines feature implemented resolution error may encountered
Use case define interaction external actor system attain particular goal
There three basic element make use case Use case modeled using unified modeling language represented oval containing name use case
Actors represented using line name actor written line
To represent actor participation system line drawn actor use case
Boxes around use case represent system boundary
Characteristics associated use case The step designing use case Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

In list action event step typically defining interaction role known system achieve goal
The actor human external system
In system engineering use case used higher level within often representing mission goal
The detailed requirement may captured SysML contractual statement
important valuable technique widely used modern software engineering since formal introduction
Use case driven development key characteristic many process model framework UP RUP OUM
With inherent iterative incremental evolutionary nature use case also fit well
In first formulated textual structural technique specifying use case
In book helped popularize technique capturing especially
Originally used term latter direct translation Swedish term found neither term sounded natural English eventually settled
Since expert also contributed great deal technique notably Dean Leffingwell Kurt Bittner Gunnar Overgaard
In Jacobson published update work called intention incorporating many practical experience applying use case since original inception concept
There many way write use case text varied template
Writing use case template devised various vendor expert common industry practice get functional system requirement
The template defined popular book one widely used writing style use case
Cockburn suggests annotating use case symbol show Design Scope may internal detail hidden internal detail shown
Five symbol available Other author sometimes call use case Organization level Business use case
Cockburn suggests annotating use case symbol show Goal Level preferred level colloquially sea level
Sometimes text writing name followed alternative text symbol etc
concise convenient way denote level

Cockburn describes detailed structure use case permit simplified le detail needed
His fully dressed use case template list following field In addition Cockburn suggests using two device indicate nature use case icon design scope goal level
Cockburn approach influenced author example Alexander generalize Cockburn Fully dressed use case template software system kind following field differing Cockburn Cockburn recognizes project may always need detailed fully dressed use case
He describes Casual use case field state There standard way write content use case different format work well different case
He describes common style use follows The Fowler style also viewed simplified variant Cockburn template
A use case defines interaction external actor system consideration accomplish goal
Actors must able make decision need human An actor might person company organization computer program computer software
Actors always stakeholder actor since never interact directly system even though right care system behaves
For example owner system company board director regulatory body Internal Revenue Service Department Insurance could stakeholder unlikely actor
Similarly person using system may represented different actor playing different role
For example user Joe could playing role Customer using Automated Teller Machine withdraw cash account playing role Bank Teller using system restock cash drawer behalf bank
Actors often working behalf someone else
Cockburn writes These day I write rep customer marketing department capture user system acting someone else
This tell project user interface security clearance designed sale rep clerk customer marketing department role concerned result
A stakeholder may play active inactive role example Consumer purchaser interacting system User actor actively interacting purchased product
In turn User normal operator actor using system intended purpose functional beneficiary stakeholder benefit use system
For example user Joe withdraws cash account operating Automated Teller Machine obtaining result behalf
Cockburn advises look actor among stakeholder system primary supporting secondary actor use case system design SuD finally among internal actor namely component system design
Use case text also diagram needed
In relationship use case actor represented originally based upon notation
us notation system block level
In addition behavioral UML diagram also used visualize use case accordingly
Specifically SSD sequence diagram often used show interaction external actor system design SuD usually visualizing particular scenario use case
Use case analysis usually start drawing use case diagram
For agile development requirement model many UML diagram depicting use case plus textual description note would lightweight enough small easy project use
As good complement use case text visual diagram representation use case also effective facilitating tool better understanding communication design complex system behavioral requirement
Below sample use case written version template
Note button control form UI element operation basic use case description user goal subgoals intention expressed every step basic flow extension
This practice make requirement specification clearer maximizes flexibility design implementation
Edit article Member system

Since inception agile movement technique popular many think best solution agile requirement project
list five reason still writes use case
In summary specifying system requirement use case apparent benefit comparing traditional approach Use case constitute powerful tool software requirement specification process
Use case modeling typically start identifying key stakeholder role interacting system goal objective system must fulfill outside perspective
These user goal become ideal candidate name title use case represent desired functional feature service provided system
This approach ensure real business value user really want developed trivial function speculated developer system inside perspective
Use case authoring important valuable analysis tool domain year
Use case often written natural language structured template
This narrative textual form legible requirement story understandable almost everyone complemented visual UML diagram foster better deeper communication among stakeholder including customer developer tester manager
Better communication result quality requirement thus quality system delivered
One powerful thing use case reside format use case especially main success scenario basic flow extension scenario fragment extension exceptional alternative flow
Analyzing use case step step precondition postconditions exploring investigating every action step use case flow basic extension identify tricky normally hidden ignored seemingly trivial realistically often costly requirement Cockburn mentioned structured beneficial way get clear stable quality requirement systematically
Minimizing optimizing action step use case achieve user goal also contribute better system
With content based upon action event flow structure model use case also serf excellent groundwork valuable guideline design test case user manual system product investment
There obvious connection flow path use case test case
Deriving functional test case use case scenario running instance use case straightforward
Limitations use case include Common misunderstanding use case Agile neutral requirement technique
As Scrum Primer state stress use case diagram text
As put Novice misunderstanding
Each step use case present goal intention essence functional requirement normally contain user interface detail
naming label button UI operation practice unnecessarily complicate use case writing limit implementation
As capturing requirement new system scratch plus often used handy valuable tool least lightweight
As put Spending much time writing tedious use case add little value result lot rework indicating writer well skilled little knowledge write quality use case efficiently effectively
Use case authored iterative incremental evolutionary way
Applying use case template mean field use case template used filled comprehensively special dedicated stage
requirement phase traditional development model
In fact use case format formulated
RUP Cockburn also adopted proved practice valuable helpful tool capturing analyzing documenting complex requirement large system
The quality good use case documentation judged largely size
It possible well quality comprehensive use case model large system may finally evolve hundred page mainly inherent complexity hand poor writing skill author
Text editor template support often used write use case
For large complex system requirement dedicated use case tool helpful
Some use case tool include Most support text writing visual modeling use case

learn share knowledge build career
In use case diagram difference
Are thing
includes us
From An include dependency formerly known us relationship UML earlier Nice writeup Summary article The usually used use case signify one use case us
In contrast used UML show dependency model one model requires order function
Here quote
In UML modeling include relationship relationship one use case base use case includes functionality another use case inclusion use case
The include relationship support reuse functionality use case model
In UML modeling usage relationship type dependency relationship one model element client requires another model element supplier full implementation operation
To recap I understand dependency model dependency functionality

I read bit actor model really understand use actor real world situation model problem
Can someone please explain
A simple example link example would much appreciated
Actors sense modeling action message etc way modeling software provides couple useful item
Actors live single thread allowing operation happen without bunch locking magic
An actor respond message inbox
When want process command send message take care order received
Just like normal queue
Thread safe killer I use number open source project I work
In language Scala example easy turn actor based code single process distributed system breaking apart actor turning channel communicate remote channel
This change implementation easy awesome feature
Helps focus Task Based event rather CRUD event
CRUD simple like interacting filing cabinet
If provide value software produce
Tying multiple action single Update command task based system useful saving DB
This also get stuff like CQRS
solid
When start talking concurrency trying solve resource problem
Concurrency thread lock pretty easy wrong
The actor model help force program concurrent portion code self contained nugget performed parallel without depending another piece code
You trying avoid nastiness like race condition deadlock
Actors like I conversation
You ca reach brain pick I typing
You passed message saying Why exist
I sat crunched number sent reply I think therefore I
You could tell I slice planet Earth contact message pas back forth
EDIT You say language comfortable see actor implementation language
Maybe simplest would actor libs python
But probably better learning would Erlang
The language little rough get nuance good language
Actors element use case diagram represent external entity user external system etc
act system
Any basic use case contain actor google use case wealth example

reproduce behavior system using
Computer simulation become useful tool mathematical modeling many natural system human system
Simulation system represented running system model
It used explore gain new insight new estimate performance system complex
Computer simulation either small running almost instantly small device program run hour day group computer
The scale event simulated computer simulation far exceeded anything possible perhaps even imaginable using traditional mathematical modeling
Over year ago simulation one force invading another involved modeling tank truck vehicle simulated terrain around using multiple supercomputer High Performance Computer Modernization Program
Other example include model material deformation model complex organelle living organism complete simulation life cycle project Switzerland begun May create first computer simulation entire human brain right molecular level
Because computational cost simulation used perform inference
A algorithm equation used capture behavior system modeled
By contrast computer simulation actual running program contains equation algorithm
Simulation therefore process running model
Thus one would build simulation instead one would build model either run model equivalently run simulation
Computer simulation developed rapid growth computer following first deployment model process
It simulation using
Computer simulation often used adjunct substitute modeling system simple possible
There many type computer simulation common feature attempt generate sample representative scenario model complete enumeration possible state model would prohibitive impossible
The external data requirement simulation model vary widely
For input might number example simulation waveform AC electricity wire others might require terabyte information weather climate model
Input source also vary widely Lastly time data available varies Because variety diverse simulation system many common element large number specialized simulation language
The may sometimes called year proposed
There
Systems accept data external source must careful knowing receiving
While easy computer read value text binary file much harder knowing compared value
Often expressed error bar minimum maximum deviation value range within true value expected lie
Because digital computer mathematics perfect rounding truncation error multiply error useful perform error analysis confirm value output simulation still usefully accurate
Even small error original data accumulate substantial error later simulation
While computer analysis subject GIGO restriction especially true digital simulation
Indeed observation inherent cumulative error digital system main catalyst development
Computer model classified according several independent pair attribute including Another way categorizing model look underlying data structure
For simulation two main class Equations define relationship element modeled system attempt find state system equilibrium
Such model often used simulating physical system simpler modeling case dynamic simulation attempted
Formerly output data computer simulation sometimes presented table matrix showing data affected numerous change simulation
The use matrix format related traditional use matrix concept
However psychologist others noted human could quickly perceive trend looking graph even generated data displayed CGI animation
Although observer could necessarily read number quote math formula observing moving weather chart might able predict event see rain headed way much faster scanning table
Such intense graphical display transcended world number formula sometimes also led output lacked coordinate grid omitted timestamps straying far numeric data display
Today model tend balance view moving cloud map us numeric coordinate numeric timestamps event
Similarly CGI computer simulation simulate might shrink change extended period medical treatment presenting passage time spinning view visible human head tumor change
Other application CGI computer simulation developed graphically display large amount data motion change occur simulation run
Generic example type computer simulation science derived underlying mathematical description Specific example computer simulation follow Notable sometimes controversial computer simulation used science include used Thomas Ray
In social science computer simulation integral component five angle analysis fostered data percolation methodology also includes qualitative quantitative method review literature including scholarly interview expert form extension data triangulation
design simulation developed
Special care taken handle event situation simulation equation valid changed
The open project started develop reusable library simulation together complete graphical environment generates code based library
Computer simulation used wide variety practical context The reliability trust people put computer simulation depends simulation therefore crucial importance development computer simulation
Another important aspect computer simulation reproducibility result meaning simulation model provide different answer execution
Although might seem obvious special point attention random number actually number
An exception reproducibility simulation flight simulation
Here human part simulation thus influence outcome way hard impossible reproduce exactly
manufacturer make use computer simulation test safety feature new design
By building copy car physic simulation environment save hundred thousand dollar would otherwise required build test unique prototype
Engineers step simulation millisecond time determine exact stress put upon section prototype
used display result computer simulation
used experience simulation
In case animation may also useful faster even slower mode
For example faster animation useful visualizing buildup queue simulation human evacuating building
Furthermore simulation result often aggregated static image using various way
In debugging simulating program execution test rather executing natively detect far error hardware detect time log useful debugging information instruction trace memory alteration instruction count
This technique also detect similar hard detect error well produce performance information data
Although sometimes ignored computer simulation important perform ensure accuracy result properly understood
For example probabilistic risk analysis factor determining success oilfield exploration program involves combining sample variety statistical distribution using
If instance one key parameter net ratio stratum known one significant figure result simulation might precise one significant figure although might misleadingly presented four significant figure
The following three step used produce accurate simulation model calibration verification validation
Computer simulation good portraying comparing theoretical scenario order accurately model actual case study match actually happening today
A base model created calibrated match area studied
The calibrated model verified ensure model operating expected based input
Once model verified final step validate model comparing output historical data study area
This done using statistical technique ensuring adequate value
Unless technique employed simulation model created produce inaccurate result useful prediction tool
Model calibration achieved adjusting available parameter order adjust model operates simulates process
For example traffic simulation typical parameter include distance sensitivity discharge headway lost time
These parameter influence driver behavior long take driver change lane much distance driver leaf car car front quickly driver start accelerate intersection
Adjusting parameter direct effect amount traffic volume traverse modeled roadway network making driver le aggressive
These example calibration parameter match characteristic observed field study location
Most traffic model typical default value may need adjusted better match driver behavior specific location studied
Model verification achieved obtaining output data model comparing expected input data
For example traffic simulation traffic volume verified ensure actual volume throughput model reasonably close traffic volume input model
Ten percent typical threshold used traffic simulation determine output volume reasonably close input volume
Simulation model handle model input different way traffic enters network example may may reach desired destination
Additionally traffic want enter network may able congestion exists
This model verification important part modeling process
The final step validate model comparing result expected based historical data study area
Ideally model produce similar result happened historically
This typically verified nothing quoting statistic fit
This statistic measure fraction variability accounted model
A high value necessarily mean model fit data well
Another tool used validate model graphical residual analysis
If model output value drastically differ historical value probably mean error model
Before using model base produce additional model important verify different scenario ensure one accurate
If output reasonably match historic value validation process model reviewed updated produce result line expectation
It iterative process help produce realistic model
Validating traffic simulation model requires comparing traffic estimated model observed traffic roadway transit system
Initial comparison trip interchange quadrant sector large area interest
The next step compare traffic estimated model traffic count including transit ridership crossing contrived barrier study area
These typically called screenlines cutlines cordon line may imaginary actual physical barrier
Cordon line surround particular area city central business district major activity center
Transit ridership estimate commonly validated comparing actual patronage crossing cordon line around central business district
Three source error cause weak correlation calibration input error model error parameter error
In general input error parameter error adjusted easily user
Model error however caused methodology used model may easy fix
Simulation model typically built using several different modeling theory produce conflicting result
Some model generalized others detailed
If model error occurs result may necessary adjust model methodology make result consistent
In order produce good model used produce realistic result necessary step need taken order ensure simulation model functioning properly
Simulation model used tool verify engineering theory valid calibrated properly
Once satisfactory estimate parameter model obtained model must checked assure adequately perform intended function
The validation process establishes credibility model demonstrating ability replicate actual traffic pattern
The importance model validation underscore need careful planning thoroughness accuracy input data collection program purpose
Efforts made ensure collected data consistent expected value
For example traffic analysis typical traffic engineer perform site visit verify traffic count become familiar traffic pattern area
The resulting model forecast better data used model estimation validation

Established International Organization Standardization OSI model divide network protocol standardized procedure exchanging information seven functional This communication architecture enables end user employing different operating system working different network communicate quickly correctly
compared conventional CSMA
Different communication requirement necessitate different network solution different network protocol create significant problem compatibility network interconnected one another
In order overcome interconnection problem open system interconnection OSI approved terminology come open system interconnection OSI communication standard established International Organization Standardization
The OSI reference model specifies protocol standard seven layer shown figure
The layering provides modularization protocol hence implementation
Each layer protocol OSI Open Systems Interconnection set guideline implementing networking communication computer
Among important set Internet protocol HTTPS SMTP DNS

We make information communication technology accessible underserved community around world
We accomplish mission providing refurbished computer nonprofit organization
As national organization refurbishes ship computer laptop worldwide focused reuse instead recycling committed highest standard clean green computer recycling disposing part peripheral
computer nonprofit non governmental organization around world
Providing computer help organization struggling make difference access communication resource
A way people business safely charitably dispose used computer equipment electronic asset
Promote reuse alternative recycling
We extend life working computer refurbishing reuse
Provide safe disposal toxic material contained computer equipment
Equipment refurbished reuse recycled according stringent environmental standard
Keep computer part equipment landfill
We work local recycling expert ensure part equipment end landfill
Headquartered Seattle Washington InterConnection largest computer electronics reuse organization Washington State
It established Charles Brennick idea InterConnection came Brennick time working Ecotourism Developer Costa Rica
He saw firsthand benefit access technology especially computer Internet could give remote organization limited resource
InterConnection original focus developing donating website nonprofit developing country website donated
The program soon expanded include computer donation technology training
In InterConnection Computer Reuse Center opened Seattle serving hub provide computer technology resource local international community need
As community based organization provide refurbished laptop desktop computer charitable organization around world
Our priority always reuse first allowing u turn old computer new opportunity
Throughout year charitable reuse program provided affordable technology people prevented million pound toxic computer component entering landfill protecting environment
Instead donated laptop PCs notebook become tool change growth future possibility

The OSI model defines networking term vertical stack seven layer
The upper layer OSI model represent software implement network service like encryption connection management
The lower layer OSI model implement function routing addressing flow control
All data go network connection pass seven layer
The OSI model introduced
Designed abstract model teaching tool OSI model remains useful tool learning today network technology protocol like
The OSI maintained standard International Standards Organization
Data communication OSI model start top layer stack sending side travel stack sender lowest bottom layer traverse physical network connection bottom layer receiving side OSI model stack
For example Internet Protocol IP corresponds Network layer OSI model layer counting bottom
TCP UDP correspond OSI model layer Transport layer
Lower layer OSI model represented technology Ethernet
Higher layer OSI model represented application protocol like TCP UDP
The bottom three layer OSI Model referred Media Layers top four layer Host layer
The layer numbered beginning bottom

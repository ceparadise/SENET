In computer science program simulate behavior software component module module undergoing test depends
Test stub mainly used incremental testing
Stubs computer program act temporary replacement called module give output actual product software
Consider computer program query database obtain sum price total product stored database
In example query slow consumes large number system resource
This reduces number test run per day
Secondly test may include value outside currently database
The method call used perform
For testing purpose source code temporarily replaced simple statement return specific value
This would test stub
Several testing framework available software generates based existing source code testing requirement
Stubs Drivers two type test harness
Test harness collection software test data configured one test program unit simulating different set condition monitoring behavior output
Stubs driver dummy module created test purpose
Stubs used top testing approach one major module ready test sub module still ready yet
So simple language stub called program called test major module functionality
For example situation one three different module Login Home User
Suppose login module ready test two minor module Home User called Login module ready yet testing
At time piece dummy code written simulates called method Home User
These dummy piece code stub
On hand Drivers one calling program
Drivers used bottom testing approach
Drivers dummy code used sub module ready main module still ready
Taking example
Suppose time User Home module ready Login module ready test
Now since Home User return value Login module dummy piece code written simulates Login module
This dummy code called Driver

For example mean quote
Integrating external API almost guarantee modern web app
To effectively test integration need
A good easy create consistently actual current API response
In post outline testing strategy using external API
A stub controllable replacement collaborator system
By using stub test code without dealing dependency directly
It object system code test interacts control
Common example filesystems thread memory time
Forexample code You want test method need simulate test method need create Fake Stub object simulate result want test code able test method
As see need simulate result another Dependency class object Existing Dependency object
A context mean mock implementation
That simple fake implementation conforms interface used testing
Layman term dummy data fake data test data etc
use test develop code party ready real data
It programmer Lorem Ipsum
Employee database ready
Make simple one Jane Doe John Doe etc
API ready
Make fake one creating static file containing fake data
You also good testing framework create stub
One preferrable There also others
But Mockito great read elegant powerfull package Stub function definition correct function name correct number parameter produce dummy result correct type
It help write test serf kind scaffolding make possible run example even function design complete By posting answer agree

A piece code convert parameter passed client server
The main idea allow local computer remotely call procedure different computer
The client server use different parameter used function procedure call converted otherwise value parameter could used pointer parameter one computer memory would point different data computer
The client server may also use different data representation even simple parameter versus integer
Stubs perform conversion parameter remote procedure call look like local function call remote computer
Stub library must installed client server side
A client stub responsible conversion parameter used function call deconversion result passed server execution function
A server stub server side responsible deconversion parameter passed client conversion result execution function
Stubs generated one two way A server program implement procedure interface said interface client program call procedure interface said interface
When writing distributed application programmer first writes interface definition using IDL programmer write client program import interface server program export interface
The interface definition processed using IDL compiler generate component combined client server program without making change existing compiler
In particular interface procedure interface compiler generate appropriate marshalling unmarshalling operation stub procedure header file support data type interface definition
The header file included source file client server program client stub procedure compiled linked client program server stub procedure compiled linked server program
An IDL compiler designed process interface definition use different language enabling client server written different language communicate using remote procedure call
To achieve goal semantics transparency designer made RPC look like LPc using concept stub hide actual RPC implementation program interface underlying RPC system

I read various article mocking v stubbing testing including still understand difference
I believe biggest distinction stub already written predetermined behavior
So would class implement dependency abstract class interface likely faking testing purpose method would stubbed set response
They would anything fancy would already written stubbed code outside test
A mock something part test setup expectation
A mock setup predetermined way code test
Mocks way determined runtime since code set expectation run anything
Tests written mock usually follow pattern testing
While stub would follow
The purpose eliminate testing dependency class function test focused simpler trying prove
There several definition object real
The general term
This term encompasses
According Mocks v Stubs Behavioral testing v State testing According principle may several stub one test generally one mock
Test lifecycle stub Test lifecycle mock Both mock stub testing give answer question Testing mock also interested Stub simple fake object
It make sure test run smoothly
Mock smarter stub
You verify Your test pass
Here description one followed real world sample
bogus value satisfy
If testing method class requires many mandatory parameter constructor test may create dummy object purpose creating new instance class
create test implementation class may dependency external infrastructure
It good practice unit test actually interact external infrastructure
Create fake implementation accessing database replace collection
override method return value also referred
Your test class depends method taking minute complete
Rather wait minute replace real implementation stub return value taking small fraction time
similar rather
This mean expect return value assume specific order method call made
Example You testing user registration class
After calling call
actually sub type swap real implementation test implementation different specific reason
In course give definition term Stub For replacing method code return specified result
Mock A stub assertion method get called
So Sean Copenhaver described answer difference mock set expectation
make assertion whether get called
Stubs fail test mock
I think simplest clearer answer question given book page The easiest way tell dealing stub notice stub never fail test
The asserts test us always class test
On hand test use mock object verify whether test failed
Again mock object object use see test failed
That mean making assertion fake mean using fake mock using fake run test without assertion using fake stub
I think important difference intention
Let try explain v
Suppose I writing test code mac twitter client public timeline controller Here test sample code By writing mock discover object collaboration relationship verifying expectation met stub simulate object behavior
I suggest read article trying know mock A Mock testing behaviour making sure certain method called
A Stub testable version per say particular object
What mean Apple way
If compare debugging like making sure method return correct value like actually making sure everything inside correct returning correct value
To clear practical Stub A class object implement method faked return always want
Example JavaScript Mock The stub add logic verifies method called sure implementation calling method
As mLevan say imagine example testing user registration class
After calling Save call SendConfirmationEmail
A stupid code Example I like explanantion put Roy Osherove
Every class object created Fake
It Mock verify call
Otherwise stub
A generic term used describe either stub mock object handwritten otherwise look like real object
Whether fake stub mock depends used current test
If used check interaction asserted mock object
Otherwise stub
make sure test run smoothly
It mean reader future test understand behavior fake object without needing read source code without needing depend external resource
Forexample code You want test method need simulate Exception test method need create Fake Stub errorService class simulate result test code able test method
As see need simulate result another External Dependency ErrorService class
Reading explanation let try condense This slide explain main difference good
CSE Lecture University Washington slide created Marty Stepp Right paper developer jMock Stubs dummy implementation production code return canned result
Mock Objects act stub also include assertion instrument interaction target object neighbour
So main difference To sum also trying disperse confusion title
I came across interesting article UncleBob
It explains terminology easy understand manner useful beginner
Martin Fowlers article hard read especially beginner like
help u run test
How
It give value help run test
These value real created value run test
For example create HashMap give u value similar value database table
So instead directly interacting database interact Hashmap
fake object run test
put assert
See example mock v stub using C Moq framework
Moq special keyword Stub use Mock object create stub
I used python example answer illustrate difference
Stubbing software development technique used implement method class early development
They used commonly placeholder implementation known interface interface finalized known implementation yet known finalized
You begin stub simply mean write definition function leave actual code later
The advantage wo forget method continue think design seeing code
You also stub return static response response used part code immediately
Stub object provide valid response static matter input pas always get response object used mock test case validate certain method called object
Mock object simulated object mimic behaviour real object controlled way
You typically creates mock object test behaviour object
Mocks let u simulate resource either unavailable unwieldy unit testing
This basic example run rm asserts parameter called
You use mock object function shown also return value mock object used replace stub testing
More note python mock included unittest downloadable module downloaded via pip pip install mock
I also read The Art Unit Testing Roy Osherove I think would great similar book written using Python Python example
If anyone know book please share
Cheers A stub fake object built test purpose
A mock stub record whether expected call effectively occurred
A stub empty function used avoid unhandled exception test A mock artificial function used avoid OS environment hardware dependency test In term assertion state object implement interface component instead returning component would return called stub configured return value suit test
Using stub unit test test unit handle various return value collaborator
Using stub instead real collaborator unit test could expressed like unit test stub unit test unit stub unit test asserts result state unit First unit test creates stub configures return value
Then unit test creates unit set stub
Now unit test call unit turn call stub
Finally unit test make assertion result method call unit

Using mock thus possible test unit handle various return value correctly also unit us collaborator correctly
For instance see value returned dao object whether data read database using Statement PreparedStatement
Nor see method called returning value
This possible mock
In word mock make possible test unit complete interaction collaborator
Not collaborator method return value used unit
Using mock unit test could expressed like unit test mock unit test unit mock unit test asserts result state unit unit test asserts method called mock More Detail following understanding create test object locally feed local service using mock object
give test method implemented local service
used verify behavior get test data real service provider though test version interface get test version object working stub stub logic accept certain input give corresponding output help perform state verification Stubs used method expected return value setup test
Mocks used void method verified Assert called
A mock intercept call method function group method function like case mocked class
It alternative method function
In interception mock whatever want record input output decide short circuit call change returned value etc
A stub valid full working implementation method function group method function like case stubbed class identical method function group method function stubbing
The stubbed implementation generally thing acceptable within context unit test mean wo IO example mimicking behavior thing stubbing
lot valid answer I think worth mention form uncle bob best explanation ever example
Stub Mock testing point view dummy implementation done user way mean Stub writing implementation code
So handle service definition dynamic condition Normally done JUnit framework without using mocking framework
also dummy implementation implementation done way using Mocking framework like Mockito
So handle condition service definition dynamic way
mock created dynamically code runtime

An expression particular concept computer science number variable constant operator function put together single statement acted particular programming language
In computer science expression written developer interpreted computer The evaluation produce return result
Simple mathematical equation expression code
They typically called arithmetic expression
Other kind numerical arithmetic expression may use variable look like algebra equation
In addition various data type character string integer floating point number others acted expression constant variable
Operators function determine computer act object given expression
Different type expression categorized according work Boolean expression evaluate either true false value numerical expression evaluate number
String expression evaluate character string text character string changed function produce different result
For instance adding exclamation point display printing phrase world would example string expression us function add ASCII character rather changing numerical value creating different code condition
In example different program would treat differently Some primitive one may use syntax like print hello world print
others might use something like String hello world String b
Print string string b Like kind fundamental expression rely specific syntax programming language
In term structure expert point expression inherently need least one value acted must one operator
Beyond important programmer understand program syntax
Inputting incorrect illegal syntax result compiling error developer make expression code module conform proper syntax order run

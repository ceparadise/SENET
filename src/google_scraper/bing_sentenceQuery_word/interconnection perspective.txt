A regularly interacting interdependent group item forming unified whole
Every system delineated spatial temporal boundary surrounded influenced environment described structure purpose expressed functioning
The term system come word turn whole concept made several part member system literary composition
According System mean something look
You must high visual gradient systematization
But philosophy prior Descartes system
Plato system
Aristotle system
In century French physicist studied pioneered development concept system
In studied system called typically body water vapor regard system ability work heat applied
The working substance could put contact either boiler cold reservoir stream cold water piston working body could work pushing
In German physicist generalized picture include concept began use term working body referring system
The biologist became one pioneer
In introduced pioneered use mathematics study system carried significant development concept
In others coined term interdisciplinary
A set element system component larger system
A subsystem description system object contains information defining characteristic operating environment controlled system
Evidently many kind system analyzed
For example analysis urban A
Steiss defined five intersecting system including physical subsystem behavioral system
For sociological model influenced system theory defined system term abstract system either
defined system sociology term model
cautioned inquiry system understanding kind crucial defined natural designed artificial system
Artificial system inherently major defect must premised one fundamental assumption upon additional knowledge built
These fundamental assumption inherently deleterious must definition assumed true actually false system structurally integral assumed
For example evident postulation extrapolation proof
It important confuse abstract definition
Theorists include natural system subatomic system
Artificial system include physical structure hybrid natural artificial system conceptual knowledge
The human element organization function emphasized relevant abstract system representation
A cardinal consideration making distinction among system determine much freedom system select purpose goal method tool etc
wide freedom select distributed concentrated
maintained classification complete perfect purpose defined system abstract bounded discrete continuous pulse etc
The interaction system environment categorized relatively closed
It seems unlikely absolutely closed system exist could known man
Important distinction also made system technical nature amenable method operation research quantitative system analysis system involve people organisation commonly associated concept developed SSM involving method emphasis participatory design
Where hard system might identified scientific distinction often elusive
A cultural system may defined interaction different element
While cultural system quite different sometimes together referred sociocultural system
A major concern social science
An economic system mechanism deal particular
The economic system composed relationship resource
It address problem like allocation scarcity resource
Systems modeling generally basic principle engineering social science
The system representation entity concern
Hence inclusion exclusion system context dependent intention modeler
No model system include feature real system concern model system must include entity belonging real system concern
In structure observable behavior
Again example illustrate There system counting various system filing paper catalogue various library system example
This still fit definition component connected together case facilitate flow information
System also refer framework aka software hardware designed allow software program run
In physical system portion universe studied one major example
Engineering also concept system referring part interaction part complex project
branch engineering study type system planned designed implemented built maintained
Social recognize system human person model human society
They include human brain function mental process well normative ethic system behavioral pattern
In OD human organization viewed conceptual system interacting component subsystem system aggregate carrier numerous complex organizational structure
Organizational development theorist developed notion organization system book
style problem solving
It start recognition system property given problem
It leadership competency
Some people
Such people consider potential consequence decision part larger system
This also basis systemic coaching psychology
also described working organizational system new metaphoric context
There also thing logical system
The obvious example calculus developed simultaneously
Another example Boolean operator
Other example related specifically philosophy biology cognitive science
applies psychology biology using pure logic
Numerous psychologist including developed system logically organize psychological domain personality motivation intellect desire
Often domain consist general category following
Logic applied category
In military strategist introduced model book contending complex system could broken five concentric ring
Each Processes Infrastructure Population Action used isolate key element system needed change
The model used effectively Air Force planner
In late Warden applied model business strategy

Root cause analysis approach drill deep identify basic reason root repeatedly asking question logical answer From Change analysis investigation technique involves precise specification single deviation change difference leading deviation may found comparison similar situation deviation occurred
This approach applicable situation performance shifted significantly
It explores change made people equipment information may contributed change performance

The method discovering root cause
Continuously asking help drive discovery reason error
The fundamental reason failure error root cause
Five technique used many time human interaction involved process problem error arose
For example patient died computer froze important ask happened
Why patient die
Because operation could continue
Why could operation continue
Because computer screen froze
Why computer screen freeze
Because computer powered many day use
Why machine powered
Because running surgery know computer needed shut faster simply hibernate machine
After determining root cause problem problem could solved someone designated power computer operation
Problem discovery healthcare system often complex previous example many cause found interact event
suggests involvement stakeholder interdisciplinary team important drilling cause
The team need answer happened happened happened done prevent reoccurrence
Teams rather individual become focus accreditation body thorough analysis root cause often avoid sanction particularly sentinel event one described patient died
Evidently Joint Commission formerly called JCAHO maintains database sentinel event tracking review
The JCAHO started endeavor continues today
Over event collected
What treasure trove database would medical data miner
focusing question
The question given shareholder
It wise find variable actually predict rather people think predict
In word team brainstorm collect information clinical note
Members might assume know cause feature selection sometimes point predictive relationship thought without statistical analysis
A number tutorial text contain feature selection analysis
provided thorough explanation fishbone process show fishbone diagram skeleton illustrating cause problem
The author also mentioned fishbone diagram turned positive exploring path opportunity increasing good outcome
In reverse fishbone item stated positively outcome value added
also used graphical understanding problem outcome
Decision tree generated using data could easily used searching root cause
demonstrated use decision tree finding best test patient considering cost involved see

The hospital deciding whether infection cause unintended death consider condition patient upon entering hospital
Certainly surgery undergo RCA
Exploring extra cost phlebotomy redraws may affect bottom line
Examining complication plastic surgery study abdominoplasty
One photograph article showed nasty infection patient described
The author pointed avoid possible necrotizing fasciitis paramount patient access qualified person surgeon least day
discus current trend people obtain medical care expensive surgery country
There always enough time infection control worked travel plan
reported RCA concerning patient died second kidney stone operation
The patient died bleeding day second operation see disseminated intravascular coagulation learn bleeding surgery
A CT scan revealed fractured kidney
This event brought investigation Sentinel Event

By using pinpoint cause contaminated sample lab lean team instituted standardized process urine collection along education critical care unit started approximately contaminated sample
Contaminated sample produce false positive increase time also expensive
The standardized process hospital instituted provided lab sample
This process change eliminated much lab rejecting sample hour old
With sample lab could work faster reject fewer
By end year contamination rate dropped

Diagnostic Quality Assurance Cytopathology To ass change time HRT us called topographic change analysis TCA
This statistical method compare topographic value superpixels time
It calculates probability value difference height value two time point caused chance alone
A high value would indicate high probability change caused chance low value would mean change occur chance
Topographic change analysis automatically done third scan obtained one baseline two scan
The analysis made raw topographic value independent disc contour delineation
The display occurs change probability map reflectivity map overlaid superpixels significant value change

The RNFL thickness longitudinal evaluation OCT explored recent study
Wollstein et al compared ability peripapillary RNFL measurement obtained OCT visual field clinical assessment detecting progression glaucoma suspect glaucoma patient
Investigators found greater likelihood glaucomatous progression identified OCT versus automated perimetry
Safety investigation also use TEM process effective tool
Triggered event safety investigator use TEM process conduct thorough analysis occurred
The initial step list threat error whether managed mismanaged
Also linking error threat many time identify latent systemic threat otherwise would overlooked
The fact threat mismanaged might indicate never properly identified strategy manage particular threat employed
This could help focus training improving skill area
The process would utilized error
A mismanaged threat often lead error mismanaged error lead event
Since error trapped either safety hardware policy put place Resist employee use CRM skill resolve analysis lead better corrective action
This type investigative analysis help identify needed change training safety hardware policy procedure human factor training
NTSB Board Member Robert Sumwalt stated presence company employee right thing even one watching
The LOSA TEM program integral part company Safety Management System SMS key element establishing safety culture
TEM process enables employee better identify manage threat error everyday life
By longer think rather establish safety core value
If action taken address root cause verified confirm corrective action taken effective entire investigation waste time resource
In today competitive environment company afford waste time resource therefore money door
More important completing verification effectiveness help company document proper investigation completed
In chapter review determine constitutes proper verification effectiveness verify corrective preventive action fact effective
We also review constitutes successful execution CAPA plan demonstrate corrective action effectively addressed mitigated root cause identified CAPA record
This chapter provide outline needed complete verification effectiveness VOE plan corrective action preventive action
This comprehensive troubleshooting guide type immunoassay
Instructions provided use chapter investigate improve unsatisfactory assay performance
Each type performance issue separate section list possible cause used starting point
For possible cause information provided allow reader dismiss unlikely cause immediately resulting shortlist possible cause consistent fact
Then suggested course action provides strategy identifying likely cause shortlist
Recognizing investigation many immunoassay problem involves user manufacturer working together checklist useful information provided user prepare efficient dialogue manufacturer
Finally case study type problem provided eventual solution
recommended Bayesian technique use learning model
This book allows researcher conduct research many way
Some may use huge data warehouse also developing learning model analysis
Others may use EBM data tailoring treatment individual patient predicting specific outcome
There doubt accrediting agency impact upon local research effort
We see potential effect building result recent legislation
The signed law President Obama March included new requirement accrediting agency
On June Supreme Court upheld law
The original document massive tedious read yet medical community read also understand document law affected much practitioner would paid
Two nine Obama bill directly related need book quality efficiency health access innovative medical
The author book hoped ACA law would move consumer become informed outcome related different medical treatment care health
In addition hoped law would insure doctor would reimbursed according patient outcome
In way doctor would become thinking
Ideally Medicare would reimburse excellence care data would become available transparent analyze outcome
As result law hoped see research quality treatment led good result
Ideally ACA would force accreditation organization revamp standard reflect requirement related law
In best case scenario law would support metric methodology associated modern accurate predictive analytics
Because standardization equates community trust accredited healthcare organization advertise recognized provider quality patient care
In Dr Mitchel Goldstein present The Joint Commission TJC detail
TJC recognized national accrediting organization
The TJC accredited healthcare entity throughout United States
On website Commission list accreditation standard Ambulatory health care Behavioral health care Critical access hospital Home care hospital Laboratory service care
The mission statement continuously improve health care public collaboration stakeholder evaluating health care organization inspiring excel providing safe effective care highest quality
As TJC make change publishes prepublication change
In listed prepublication statement Standard Vaccination Licensed Independent Practitioners Staff hospital link
The standard may purchased TJC website
Woven within standard requirement proof standard number hospital written description methodology used determine influenza vaccination When accreditation team arrives direction given method determining denominator numerator rate provided hospital
Obviously analytical process program like Six Sigma see would apply hospital attempt improve required quality standard
For example standard number state hospital includes infection control plan goal improving influenza vaccination
Lean Hospital Examples provides information The Joint Commission report listing hospital according specific set standard set The Joint Commission
HIMSS organization concentrate IT
devoted highly influential group
one model process analysis control
The Leapfrog initial three recommended quality safety practice potential save life prevent medication error year
predicted many life saved Leapfrog initiative
The first three initiative Computerized Physician Order Entry Intensive Care Unit Physician Staffing Hospital Referral
another quality healthcare group work United States also abroad
One able sign cost benefit many wonderful educational assistance program hospital individual school
private organization based state
They contract Centers Medicare Medicaid Services CMS dedicated improving quality review medical care given Medicare patient
educational organization main association QIOs provides mean communication collaboration QIOs
AHQA provides expertise help develop quality project medical delivery system
funded Affordable Care Act ACA future every person signed ACA sent PCORI
In way PCORI become major influence quality health care United States
The group contract research proposal healthcare quality improvement increased transparency
Healthcare entity may apply application reviewed democratic process scientist stakeholder drug company device manufacturer etc
patient representative patient patient advocate
heart organization predictive analytics encouraged improve individual outcome
In shift focus toward patient outcome occur predictive analytic research
This book help researcher effort using new learning model data analysis

method used identifying fault problem
A factor considered root cause removal thereof prevents final undesirable outcome recurring whereas causal factor one affect event outcome root cause
Though removing causal factor benefit outcome prevent recurrence certainty
Essentially based four general principle extended throughout article RCA particularly useful world commercial aviation
Root cause may described point causal chain applying corrective action intervention would prevent problem occurring
RCA applied methodically identify correct root cause event rather simply address symptomatic result
Focusing correction root cause goal entirely preventing problem recurrence
Conversely RCFA Root Cause Failure Analysis recognizes complete prevention recurrence one corrective action always possible
RCA typically used reactive method identifying event cause revealing problem solving
Analysis done event occurred
Insights RCA make potentially useful preemptive method
In event RCA used predict probable event even occur
While one follows RCA completely separate process
For example imagine fictional segment student received poor testing score
After initial investigation verified student taking test final period school day got lower score
Further investigation revealed late day student lacked ability focus
Even investigation revealed reason lack focus hunger
So root cause poor testing score hunger remedied moving testing time soon lunch
As another example imagine investigation machine stopped overloaded little fuse blew
Investigation show machine overloaded bearing sufficiently lubricated
The investigation proceeds find automatic lubrication mechanism pump pumping sufficiently hence lack lubrication
Investigation pump show worn shaft
Investigation shaft worn discovers adequate mechanism prevent metal scrap getting pump
This enabled scrap get pump damage
The root cause problem therefore metal scrap contaminate lubrication system
Fixing problem ought prevent whole sequence event recurring
Compare investigation find root cause replacing fuse bearing lubrication pump probably allow machine go back operation
But risk problem simply recur root cause dealt
Rather one sharply defined methodology RCA comprises many different tool process philosophy
However several defined approach school identified basic approach field origin
Despite different approach among various school root cause analysis share common principle
Several general process performing RCA also defined
RCA step form critical part successful corrective action directing corrective action true root cause problem
Knowing root cause secondary goal prevention possible determine absolutely effective corrective action defined problem without knowing root cause

In series step easy root cause analysis process requires special training little effort lot common sense
By Documented management supported incident response process process response team well trained wo necessarily achieve ultimate objective preventing recurrence unless root cause identified
In series step easy root cause analysis process requires special training little effort lot common sense
In Part look constructing simple root cause diagram later analysis
Many organization even response team fail prevent recurrence unwanted event treat symptom instead underlying cause
For example payroll late switch failed many organization would simply look deal better switch failure
But switch failure may proximate cause root cause
For purpose I define proximate cause activity occurred spatially temporally immediately prior incident
The root cause often failed control process gap staff skill set caused earlier condition event
This earlier event set series cause effect leading proximate cause
In Figure example root cause condition activity occurred Event well proximate cause
The best way prevent recurrence change happened Event
In word making change process condition early chain event usually better managing proximate cause
In switch failure example organization might discover underlying problem missing broken change management process
Fixing root cause prevent switch failure recurrence
It would also help prevent unrelated failure well
There many way build root cause diagram
The popular approach pushed root cause trainer fishbone Ishakawa diagram
A simple fishbone shown Figure complicated analysis shown Figure
However u technical type prepared inclined spend time building complex framework
We need something straightforward something quickly get root cause get next user system issue arose worked one
The Five Why answer challenge
consists eight step lead incident managed resolution including root cause analysis recurrence prevention
Step root cause analysis simple approach
Ask five time able identify fundamental issue issue leading primary event
Although many practitioner actually graph answer I prefer
As discus Part picture often make easier see problem
Let step example shown Figure
In incident vendor supplied desktop computer controlled critical production system replaced
The production system immediately failed causing interruption critical process
The root cause analysis team formed following company AAR process ensuring complete objective recording event
To begin analysis facilitator asked first
Why incident happen
Two proximate cause identified
First replacement system configured properly
Second response user problem report effective
The team agreed two cause treated separately
They appear result different cause effect chain
For example focus caused bad system configuration
The facilitator continued asking second
Why system configured improperly
This continued answer three iteration
The assumption sufficient granularity identify root cause
But root cause sometimes apparent answering fifth
When happens team must step process looking activity condition might omitted first pas
Like AAR process root cause analysis must free
Every participant must understand participation result disciplinary action peer ridicule management must back assertion
We continue process identifying one root cause decide

This area data science public le familiar
This example involves small data simulation year old crowdsourcing
It attempt explain cause TWA Flight exploded near New York July
I raised possibility potential cause Malaysia Airlines flight went missing last week hit missile accidental
Likewise many people still believe TWA destroyed missile
However numerous investigation strongly debunk myth
Here I summarize data science concept used debunk missile theory TWA flight tragedy
Traces explosive found later attributed military investigator might accenditally contaminated wreckage AFTER investigation started
But clearly ruled based fracture burn human remains fireball caused bomb missile warhead
Intervews witness scattered area recorded
Witnesses answered question flight path sound time sound light streak sky including light sound intensity question
That crowdsourcing part crucial ruling missile theory explained next paragraph
Note data science involving data recording using right metric asking right question checking whether answer consistent across witness
Some criticized FBI asking question contained keyword missile create bias answer
Monte Carlo simulation data science technique used
After missile visibility test conducted April NTSB determined witness observed missile attack would seen light burning missile motor ascending rapidly steeply second light disappearing second upon missile striking aircraft igniting CWT another light moving considerably slowly laterally first second light descending simultaneously developing fireball falling toward ocean
None witness document described scenario
Note lot variance witness perception happened based location personal factor
There also lot variance missile hitting plane scenario could appear based launched missile factor
Reconciliating proving case witness report missile simulation totally incompatible matter slice various factor challenging data science task
Anyway reading I convinced caused missile
Do still believe missile theory
Maybe believe analysis wrong truth hidden
What recent Malaysia Airlines crash
Could missile

TB Computer science widely taught even though programming may one important skill century
While school recognize importance helping student learn use new technology still find scant opportunity class student learn actually technology
A issued last year Association Computing Machinery found state offer computer science education
Just nine state allow CS course count towards graduation requirement math science
And state require computer science graduation
Why absence CS course elementary secondary school
A point obstacle teaching computer science question teacher certification debate CS curriculum contain concern CS fit curriculum schedule
Is computer science math
Is science
Does replace another course
There doubt increasing opportunity kid learn programming
But often occur project thing like program learning code online material like
While attract student interested programming little expose general student population computer science
Studies repeatedly shown early exposure science technology engineering math STEM subject important convincing student think STEM career
Earlier year college student pursuing STEM degree nearly four five said made decision STEM major high school earlier
One five said made decision middle school earlier
These student pointed influence particular teacher particular class sparking interest notably almost girl said made decide study STEM versus boy
But one five college student said education helped prepare extremely well college course
While interpreted challenge state STEM education broadly particularly true come computer science
There plenty opportunity student take biology stepping Biology class college opportunity student take programming stepping CS
Program programmed author say noting must learn producer consumer computer technology
But teaching computer science simply learning program
It computational thinking logic reasoning problem solving
These skill imperative student learning
The challenge finding support among administrator teacher make learning computer science way student gain skill
Computers tool
Computer science make much sense drill science chain saw science
Obviously term computer science could invented
It creation educational system
To stimulate STEM give grade school kid REAL SCIENCE fiction
Not Hyperion Hitch Hikers Guide galaxy
Try Omnilingual Henry Beam Piper All Day September Roger Kuykendall The Fourth R George Smith Yes computer science bit problem name
In Europe CS actually called Informatics
And computational machine precursor computer existed early late century
Astronomy called telescope science still concept study space without telescope
Algorithms something taught without computer
Perhaps science computing would better
It actually broad field includes study information study compute thing computed
Programs proven similar way mathematical equation
You study interface touch human psychology well figuring computer
Artificial intelligence delf human brain work nature intelligence might explore way without computing
Computer Science name may make sense lot computer science study without computer
The machine necessary study theory
Go read Alan Turing believe
Why teach physic incorporate mathematics computer science
Write computer program math physic
LOL Like put mass floating air use conservation momentum compute fast top force rest
Then vary distribution mass
second minimum
opinion computer science brought existing class concrete available wonderful need technology teacher assist subject teacher least point Computer science course became popular late school started purchase early personal computer
At time little software available wanted computer something write code
As time went computer could programming became le necessary got point computer science course disappeared lot high school
Forward looking school give credit online programming course
This one type course well suited online instruction
I created taught school first computer science course
This allowed become district computer director ultimately principal
Now I write HTML code blog
Being able program valuable
Thanks post keep good work
That sort feel like trick question
I want say yes required mean whole new set standardized test CS another worm
There real issue addressed CS education like equity job preparedness national competitiveness
The digital divide complex ever referring access technology also encompassing paradigm shift technology literacy competent user technology tool fluency capable creator technology tool
Understanding technology work key
Thats like saying everyone drive car must trained car mechanic hey Ive got washing machine school teaching washing machine repair skill I live ahouse absolutely must teach framing
Code jockey specialised professional learning skill developed degree level like engineering design theoretical physic yes maybe give idea go program actual coding way
What saying complete nonsense
Like author already mentioned But teaching computer science simply learning program
It computational thinking logic reasoning problem solving Learning computer science skill important developing logical thinking problem solving skill
It help develop brain skill applicable many area describe
If teaching coding even language target kid help training kid brain valid
Your fast dismiss possibility
We could replace useless foreign language course computer language course
You wrote We could replace useless foreign language course computer language course
This reminds joke Q What call person speak three language
A Trilingual Q What call person speak two language
A Bilingual Q What call person speak one language
A Gringo Told Mexican spoke good American English You learn language get know new culture new people
I speak Englishman enjoying living Germany speaking German fluently
Don insular
Best wish Jerry A better name computational science
CS study theoretical foundation information computation
So CS exactly synonymous programming
If anything programming simply tool used CS
Like Bunsen burner chemist
This comment another article I read sum pretty well
I CS degree never meant teach program
They teach complexity theory
Electrical Engineers hand taught programming
Hire EE grad code CS people run Also CS mathematical discipline way school teaching CS skill math program
I agree would good idea offer class teach programming elective core requirement
So CS exactly synonymous programming Thanks saying
It small misunderstanding distracting
By mean work computer skill curriculum mean offer elective kid want take programming course early possible mean sneak least lesson two required coursework make kid write simple Ruby example program know programming
A summer elective would fine
The main educational path fundamental subject job skill
As senior research engineer specializing computational science industrial application fundamental subject help
From I seen little feed solution difficult techical problem computer programming
Our kid learn Matlab part physic class junior senior year
It pretty clear one aptitude algorithm logic excel area others give copy neighbor code finish project
Some get others like subject
I mind job security
Wasn quote Byte early said Knowing computer program like knowing read write
Should required
Absolutely
You better requiring everyone take automotive shop least everyone car would work better
Though CS useful I think far vital people learn use spreadsheet almost every business job day use extensively many job least use occasionally
No
Leave u alchemical illuminati uninitiated mass let student continue think varsity football player important ensuring holy echelon priesthood one day dominate world
I say make teaching read write first priority
Learning program learning read write
Whether English Java understanding syntax language work
People learn music tend better math music another way calculating
People learn programming language tend better reading writing another way expressing idea
YES
YES
YES
Ezra
I get sick hearing argument replied There huge difference job training education
It easy put computer classroom
Education hard
The education industry convinced u go easy
What many people miss fact teaching particular skill discipline need exclusive else
When teaching figurative language I would bring phrase used different environment
What Azure someone world technology would different someone teaching painting
It possible work across discipline introduce student problem solving critical thinking logic language etc take instructor willing work beyond text worksheet student willing learn well
There technology allowing student blog teacher play computer teacher williing teach beyond district matrix student would prepared competitive global workforce whatever chosen vocation
Writing code minor part landscape matter ability manipulate data extract information understand information impact decision making process
I think right thing establish broadly interpreted information science curriculum basis taught
Like everything else literature astronomy
I glad computer science taken school inevitably turn either Java io Office parochial junk computational characteristic bubble sort either way waste people time
Computer Science required
It teach student creator technology passive consumer
It teach computational thinking way understand really learn
The problem branding Computer Science accepted field education
We may need rename Computer Science school place STEM program
In Los Altos School District California example every grader learning Computer Science part STEM class
As former elementary teacher father I know kid like make stuff happen
Boys girl alike enjoy making something move making thing happen
I thinking experience Scratch
When student learned program character stuff screen move turn change costume feel sense empowerment
Even thing go according plan kid react frustration anger
They looked code said hmmm interesting
Why character X I expecting I would like promote kind thinking attitude towards problem solving
How teaching karnaugh mapping finite state machine mvp petrinets besides boolean algebra
Oh yes parent complaining enough history international geography causing socially illiterate
And teacher want teach nettiquette
Another thing math science skill dropping English language
Some parent want school teach language
How mixing religion creationism like kooky school board banana republic state like Kansas
Yes let pile school child
Allowing student acquire skill computer science across worthy proposition
DZ Guest comment regarding discarding useless foreign language sad truly pitiful
Learning example unlike learning foreign language
I surprised knowledge second third language would probably make better computational scientist variety cognitive reason
Along computer science student also taught art music design
When many student reach year schooling much lost term art music
Design particularly interface design part computer science course
Finally coming dual background humanity technology life taught technology impact life need measured
Those student need taught switch mindful simply human being
I see lot misunderstanding comment
Programming akin using foreign language make computer thing math problem thrown depending task
It wonderful subject teach creative problem solving many way skin cat hack something
It absolutely ideal kid abstract make
Might worth checking work Raspberry Pi UK tackle question
A small cheap computer plug TV kid every want without concern breaking school family computer
There active discussion forum teaching computational thinking school well
I think bigger question require taking separate academic class
Why Carnegie Units factory mode seat time still prevail
I think child interested learning control digital device
But long student controlled required learn I doubt solve problem
I think teacher give kid opportunity learn computer science start elementary school
Writing mobile apps one new Texas HS course
But unless student prepared logical thinking rigor avoid hard
Spatial skill need built ES taking kid world real world called computer science unplugged
How Lego Future City Course
CS computer invention creative thinking computational thinking
Yes require CS perfect field integrate reading writing arithmetic science engineering
The UK eliminated required IT curriculum replaced CS Education
This requested labor market

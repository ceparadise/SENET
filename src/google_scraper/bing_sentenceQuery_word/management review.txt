As every manager know new technology transforming product market business process entire industry revolutionizing business environment
Yet technology loom factor competition emphasis managerial book executive education class corporate training seminar soft art leadership change management employee motivation
In word science technology reshape essence business le useful concept management science seems
On reflection paradox surprising
The traditional scientific approach management promised provide manager capacity analyze predict control behavior complex organization led
But world manager currently inhabit often appears unpredictable uncertain even uncontrollable
Not long ago example Compaq Computer everybody model lean dynamic could successfully battle sluggish giant IBM
But like Dell Northgate arrived scene
Now yesterday today sluggish giant Compaq face painful task recreating radically changed competitive environment
In face dynamic volatile business world traditional mechanism scientific management seem le useful positively counterproductive
And science appears le le relevant practical concern manager
However problem may lie le shortcoming scientific approach management manager understanding science
What manager think scientific management based conception science current scientist would defend
What manager become preoccupied volatility business environment scientist also become preoccupied inherent volatility nature dynamic unpredictable unstable system natural world
Put simply traditional science focused analysis prediction control new science emphasizes chaos complexity
Today scientist developing powerful description way complex swarm mosquito computer program future trader commodity effectively uncertainty rapid change
And therein lie opportunity fruitful dialogue world management world science
The new rule complex behavior scientific research describes intriguing parallel organizational behavior many company trying encourage
Science long esteemed business source technological innovation may ultimately prove greatest value manager source something else useful new way looking world
The text reviewed suggest broad outline might become new scientific management
Their message management may indeed science manager think
To understand implication new science management start book coined term scientific In industrial engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor published magnum opus laid ground rule efficient industrial organization
Taylor book classic managerial literature
His idea shaped company across industrial spectrum defined task management generation manager
Frederick Winslow Taylor New York Harper
James Gleick New York Viking
Mitchell Waldrop New York Simon Schuster
Peter Senge New York Doubleday
Taylor book profoundly influenced concern time
In nineteenth century Newton law motion first used analyze force exerted complex physical system allowing scientist predict behavior system
Meanwhile principle thermodynamics elucidated second half nineteenth century provided one missing complete Newton conception physical world
Together theory allowed scientist calculate machine could function maximum efficiency
From opening page book Taylor preoccupied problem efficiency applies organization
When come natural resource argued people clearly understand need efficiency see feel waste material But larger waste human effort brought awkward inefficient movement men le visible le tangible vaguely According Taylor fundamental cause waste human effort unscientific management
In word thought manager focused much output work enough process work done
In workplace manager paid worker predetermined output usually type piecework system left work crew determine actual method work
Taylor disparaged approach calling initiative incentive system
It giving special inducement incentive employer hope even approximately get initiative It ironic read Taylor criticism today much emphasis placed encouraging employee initiative job crafting incentive system pay Still good reason Taylor saw initiative incentive part problem rather part solution
As long manager day depended work group decide work done way directly influence efficiency organization
Indeed traditional management inherently unstable system forced manager either rely coercion abdicate authority altogether
For example one common way manager tried boost productivity regularly raising piece rate worker met
But induced worker engage soldiering limit output intentionally order undermine established rate
Taylor solution substitution science individual judgment Managers separate planning work actual execution reserve choice method particular task done
By analyzing step work process creating standardized procedure step manager could identify one best method performing task would guarantee maximum efficiency
The best management true science Taylor wrote resting upon clearly defined law rule principle And law constituted understandable predictable controllable system
In past man first future system must In effect Taylor urged individual manager think scientist alone understands fundamental law system studying
For Taylor worker played passive role almost part apparatus experiment
Over book Taylor repeated general principle No matter job seemingly simple task science underlies workman act great amount much workman best suited actually work incapable either lack education insufficient mental capacity understand It manager armed scientific predisposition search general law rule understand true science work
But say Taylor ignored issue employee motivation psychological dimension work
On contrary major part concern accurate study motif influence That scientific management successful Taylor term manager must analyze reorganize work
They need effect complete revolution mental attitude worker
Yet even Taylor reflected scientific assumption belief motif influence men reduced scientific analysis control way physical activity shoveling iron cutting metal
In discussing employee motivation Taylor noted At first may appear matter individual observation judgment proper subject exact scientific But psychological law complicated subject exception owing fact complex human experimented Taylor maintained law kind apply large majority men unquestionably exist clearly defined great value guide dealing After lofty language Taylor actual suggestion
For example insisted productivity improvement based scientific management shared worker higher wage otherwise cooperate work reorganization
Other suggestion crude simplistic like major piece advice Never deal worker group deal one individual time
When men work gang individual efficiency fall almost invariably level worst man Taylor solution worker assigned individual task perform greatest possible isolation
But whatever one think specific suggestion share scientific regard reductionism breaking thing isolated part order better control
Indeed technique scientific planning department study standardization method tool many mean end
But Taylor urged reader confuse technique basic scientific principle
It standardization method adoption best implement working condition cooperation faster work assured
And duty enforcing adoption standard enforcing cooperation rest Frederick Taylor principle inaugurated revolution management organization work
In decade book publication Taylor idea contributed massive increase productivity standard living
However experience last year taught manager new business environment scientific principle recipe disaster
In market fragmentation work separation planning execution isolation worker create rigid organization adapt quickly change
As result manager must rethink fundamental element Taylor system work organization employee motivation task management
The majority new managerial team work group networked either direct indirect response inadequacy Taylor original model
Yet proliferation specific technique fundamental principle new managerial paradigm far clear
At current crossroad recent development science may prove helpful
Even Taylor codifying organizational system scientist beginning understand shortcoming scientific model system based
Within decade publication Taylor book new development relativity theory quantum extreme space time universe entirety subatomic particle law Newtonian physic broke
And recently scientist extended message uncertainty unpredictability everyday world
physic based Newton law motion posited neat correspondence cause effect
Scientists confident could reduce even complex behavior interaction simple law calculate exact behavior physical system far future
This conviction profoundly shaped Taylor analysis organization complex organism human work
But past decade scientist concluded many science traditional assumption way nature operates fundamentally wrong
Far predictable nature appears random throw dice
Chaos theory general term new model thing work probably best introduction book science writer James Gleick
According Gleick chief catalyst chaos theory research MIT meteorological scientist Edward Lorenz
In early Lorenz developed computer program simulated weather system
By plugging number representing initial state wind temperature Lorenz program churned subsequent weather pattern evolved time
Lorenz like scientist assumed small change initial condition fed computer would result correspondingly small change evolution entire system
To surprise discovered even minuscule change caused drastic alteration weather pattern
In effect slight breeze Idaho drop temperature Massachusetts could end changing balmy weather Florida hurricane month later
The effect defied intuition meteorologist previously understood science
Intrigued Lorenz puzzle scientist wide variety field began experimenting simulation physical system discover identical phenomenon
An infinitesimal change initial condition could profound effect evolution entire system
Take simple example water dripping faucet
Speed rate flow ever slightly pattern drop fall change radically
Repeat experiment pattern completely different
What pattern drip formation change way one model
Even powerful supercomputer predict next drip fall
What true weather dripping faucet proved equally true vast majority physical system
A slight shift temperature cause sudden turbulence pan water
A tiny accumulation charge trigger lightning bolt
A small shift fertility rate double population community gypsy moth
This basic minute change lead radical deviation behavior natural inaugurated equally radical shift scientist see world
Put simply emphasis predictability control given way late appreciation power randomness chance
For practical purpose behavior even relatively simple physical system fundamentally unpredictable
But say chaotic system pattern
While idea nature fundamentally random counterintuitive chaos theory second basic insight even pattern lurk beneath seemingly random behavior system
In fact system end anywhere certain path apparently make least occur much chaos theorist call path strange Thus meteorologist say certainty weather particular day future estimate probability kind weather likely occur
In word strange attractor allow scientist determine within broad statistical parameter system likely never exactly system likely
The precision traditional physic replaced statistical estimate probability
In addition scientist identify predictable pattern system turned head
Instead trying break system component part analyze behavior part reductionist tradition influenced scientist learn holistic approach
They focus increasingly dynamic overall system
Rather attempting explain order designed part system emphasize order emerges interaction part whole
The quest gain insight make use order emerges chaotic system subject Mitchell Waldrop upcoming book
Waldrop contributing correspondent magazine describes recent research Santa Fe Institute New Mexico think tank specializing analysis system
The institute brought together eclectic group scientist focus way simple action independent component combine produce extremely complex behavior even absence central intelligence control
Santa Fe chemist example examining molecule organize protein
Biologists determining cell arrange immune system
And economist considering limited action individual buyer seller form complex market industry economy
In process Santa Fe researcher developed basic rule Waldrop call complex adaptive These system Waldrop claim among successful nature
Some example include ecology tropical rain forest colony ant even human brain
Such system several characteristic common
First consist network agent act independently one another without guidance central control
For example one brain roughly billion neuron kind miniature chemical computer follows independent pattern behavior
Take neuron brain still function
There master neuron central area brain control neuron
Yet agent capable engaging cooperative behavior
They form group community cooperate producing behavior single agent could accomplish
In brain neuron connected million others
Some community neuron clustered particular area brain specialize function language visual recognition
It precisely interaction among neuron produce human intelligence
For example structural difference individual squid neuron human neuron relatively small
However human brain contains many neuron squid also organization neuron much complex interwoven
A particular kind feedback make possible
In sense system learning system specific sort
Capable learning feedback external environment also embed learning actual structure
For instance set neuron involved piece mental recognizing face solving mathematical stronger actual chemical connection among neuron easier brain make connection next time
Indeed human brain forever reconfiguring connection neuron response external internal stimulus
In way system constantly rearrange effect previous action change external condition ripple system
Information embedded structure
As external condition change structure system automatically change
Finally learning feedback allow system operate flexible system usually contain array specialized behavioral niche occupied specific agent group agent
However old niche constantly disappear new one created external environment change
Therefore agent permanently locked previously useful behavior since become obsolete help system whole adapt change
Waldrop note system tend change rapidly completely becomes meaningless talk agent group agent optimizing term redolent focus efficiency behavior
Rather system characterized Waldrop call perpetual In general complex adaptive system found nature contain individual agent network create highly organized behavior respond feedback environment adjust behavior accordingly learn experience embed learning structure system reap advantage specialization without getting stuck rigidity
If characteristic sound familiar closely match new kind organization many manager struggling create order cope frequently environment
According Waldrop complexity researcher applied concept emerging field specific organizational problem manager face
But one area research Santa Fe Institute take step direction
Economists institute creating computer simulation economic transaction much Lorenz simulated weather system year ago
Their goal model complex market behavior constructing interaction limited set simple building block
Instead viewing economy kind Newtonian machine writes Waldrop would see something organic adaptive surprising Simulating economic behavior easy
Although programmer need model simple behavior individual agent let rest always clear simple behavior result simulation accurately reflects reality
So far Santa Fe researcher come convincing computer version entire economy
They however developed simulation represent limited aspect economic activity simulation produced quite realistic behavior
One program example simulates stock market
It consists agent decide buy sell stock
As real stock market action computerized trader determine price stock
At first trader made decision randomly soon came buy sell stock exactly classical economic theory say stock fundamental value set discount rate dividend
Still later simulation agent discovered studying history stock price performance could make money bidding stock actual value
The result computer system learned simulate kind bubble crash occur real market
Much chaos theory revealed shortcoming traditional physicist mathematical model world simulation pointed shortcoming elegant mathematical model neoclassical economist
For Santa Fe researcher stock market simulation start
They believe accurately simulate entire economy computer system could used word one scientist quoted Waldrop flight simulator economic decision making
Such program could estimate probability boom bust cycle simulate effect various government policy indicate change consumer business behavior might lead vital economy
In meantime one leading Santa Fe researcher founded Prediction Company commodity trading company make investment decision help computerized trading simulator
Chaos theorist complexity scientist may studying business organization perspective already shaped recent managerial literature
For example consider one popular managerial book last year MIT researcher Peter Senge
If Taylor chief concern inefficiency waste Senge chaos loss purpose frequently come wake
Most people Senge argues feel lost organization part
Managers overwhelmed much information many rapid change many conflicting demand
When asked living Senge writes people describe task perform every day purpose greater enterprise take part
Most see within system little influence
They job put time try cope force outside According Senge systematic inability cope complexity direct result traditional scientific approach management
From opening sentence attack reductionism center Taylor system science
From early age Senge note taught break apart problem fragment world
This apparently make complex task subject manageable pay hidden enormous price
We longer see consequence action lose intrinsic sense connection larger In sense manager position rather similar natural scientist
They understand relationship cause effect organization
But fact link action result infinitely complicated manager suspect
Senge call core learning dilemma organization today We learn best experience never directly experience consequence many important As result manager prisoner system supposed manage
They understand neither underlying dynamic system influence dynamic achieve organizational goal
Indeed idea manager omniscient scientific planner fundamentally misguided
According Senge The perception someone control based illusion anyone could master dynamic detailed complexity organization The alternative stop seeing organization begin viewing kind living organism
This requires holistic approach reflects chaos theory focus overall behavior system
Living system integrity Senge writes
Their character depends whole
The true organization understand challenging managerial issue requires seeing whole system generates Systems thinking fifth discipline Senge title
As portrays system thinking ability understand key interrelationship influence behavior complex system give manager capacity seeing Consider Senge story case based number real instance
After year blistering growth company call WonderTech experienced sudden sale
Desperate sustain growth senior manager hired salesperson aggressively pushed marketing
These action increase sale intended awhile
WonderTech entered period volatile swing high low demand eventually forced bankruptcy
In case study Senge trace source WonderTech failure management ignorance basic feedback process
Put simply high demand increased pressure company production capacity
Inadequate capacity meant large backlog order long delay delivery
Customers became angry dissatisfied caused sale drop
As Senge tell story senior manager understand sale grew company needed invest capacity
But fixed investment manufacturing increased need keep sale tendency push sale marketing get order
Because two side organizational never balance vicious circle high growth undercapacity delayed delivery customer dissatisfaction repeated continually growing worse
Senge note limited number feedback process work organization call system In sense organizational equivalent strange attractor chaos theory basic pattern behavior occur organization
The WonderTech story illustrates number archetype
Senge term one limit growth idea growth process produce condition collapse
The WonderTech focused sale created capacity problem retarded sale
Senge call another shifting burden idea solution problem may actually make worse undermining organization ability implement fundamental solution
Managers WonderTech became preoccupied boosting sale never able focus real solution problem expanding production capacity control delivery time
For Senge precisely systemic automatic quality process account control feeling many manager experience
Ignorant system archetype end always seeing part never whole
In contemporary organization argues work indeed understand systemic process driving human behavior change The art system thinking lie seeing complexity underlying structure generating When manager understand dynamic archetype able make deep connection system behavior position effect real change
And chaos theory teach small change big effect physical system crucial concept system theory leverage idea small action sometimes produce significant enduring In WonderTech case simple commitment rapid strategy managerial expert since enshrined rubric competing time done solve company problem salesperson world
If manager master system thinking discipline Senge describes result learning As Senge portrays learning organization characteristic remarkably similar complex adaptive system scientist discovering nature
It highly decentralized system number process local level maintain order throughout constantly adjust change
In effect Senge discipline meant replicate human organization organic control found nature
One interesting discussion book concern tool organization creating help manager develop skill need make organic control work
Take example microworlds simulation complex business situation based principle system thinking
With microworlds manager experiment organization reveal largely hidden dynamic complex system much scientist use simulation weather water dripping faucet learn physical system work
At MIT Sloan School example business student use microworld simulating rise fall People Express airline
With explore interrelated force period caused People Express lurch one fastest growth rate airline industry history sudden financial crisis eventual purchase competitor
At Hanover Insurance Company manager train claim learning laboratory microworlds simulate process adjuster settle claim insurance industry
By allowing user try alternative approach solving business problem system help manager deepen understanding system part
Microworlds also allow manager recognize strange attractor may underlie behavior organization thus identify strategy change
As language experiment laboratory suggests Senge new manager every bit much scientist Taylor course scientist different sort
As Senge put scientific manager today must researcher study organization
And must designer create learning process make possible process essential effective performance world characterized perpetual novelty change

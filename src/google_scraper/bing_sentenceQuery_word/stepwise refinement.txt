Another approach breaking large problem smaller part
It involves identifying major step involved solving problem
Each step divided substeps
If necessary substep divided subsubsteps
Suppose problem
We could divide task major step broken following substeps subdivided subdivided The whole process represented
The numbering indentation essential feature structure table
Numbering sometimes begin
The indentation numbering help u interpret table
The greater indentation detailed step
Be aware problem break group subgoals subgoals example
A complex problem may require several level indentation subgoals complex others

A way developing computer program first describing general function breaking function detail refined successive step whole program fully defined
Also called design From For stepwise refinement take look following URLs

Below example design earlier refined even detailed design c SQA

generic term computer science encompasses various approach producing computer program simplifying existing program enable formal verification
In transformation
allows process done stage
Logically refinement normally involves additional complication
The progressive preparation product backlog requirement list approach also commonly described refinement
used convert abstract data model term example implementable
Operation refinement convert operation system implementable
The strengthened weakened process
This reduces specification typically completely implementation
For example value operation could refined implemented
Implementations would equally acceptable case using different route refinement
However must careful refine equivalent since unimplementable impossible select
The term also sometimes used coined
alternative technique formal refinement possible
The opposite refinement
inspired promotes program refinement
The implementation refinement
The also extends refinement calculus component language used industrial development
In type endowed predicate assumed hold element refined type
Refinement type express used used instance type function accepts natural number return natural number greater may written
Refinement type thus related

Cork Institute Technology Page Bachelor Engineering Honours Electronic Stage NFQ Level Autumn Time Hours Answer Question THREE others All question carry equal mark Examiners O Donovan Hurley Foley
Use stepwise refinement technique design simple calculator program
The calculator accept integer perform operation addition subtraction multiplication division
b Write C code implement program developed

Describe appropriate use loop ii loop
Illustrate answer example
b Rewrite following loop loop ii loop
int p q p p printf P p printf X Squared X c
Read sentence terminated full stop output number space character contains ii
Read list number keyboard sentinel output sum average Page
Describe purpose benefit using functional approach writing program
b Describe two possible us return type function
c Write function calculates many character uppercase within string supplied parameter function called UpperCaseCount
The number uppercase character returned result function
Write function reverse content string supplied argument

Discuss interpretation function call usage Boolean expression illustrating outcome expression example determined define FALSE int FunctionCall x FALSE x function declaration int FunctionCall int x return x b Is possible shorten Boolean expression given example
Explain answer
c Write function accepts two following parameter An integer array ii The number value within integer array Display horizontal line asterisk value array
The number asterisk per line equal corresponding integer array value
value value
ii The function determine sum average number array
The two value displayed screen
The average value returned result function
Page
Design write C program Read line text file called array assume line exceeds character ii Print text file called reverse order
iii Display count number space text screen
Use function appropriate

The original work stepwise refinement used refinement development process
This loses valuable design information
A number system assist managing refinement turning refinement code
The refinement may derived existing refinement plan
programming largely replaced stepwise refinement
design may restrictive large program
programming encourages careful design data type designing procedure function
This reduces apparent size individual program
The best approach may balanced mix design stepwise refinement

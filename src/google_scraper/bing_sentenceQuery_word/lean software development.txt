The nature software development changed recent year
Today software included vast amount product car mobile phone entertainment forth
The market product characterized highly dynamic frequent change need customer
As consequence company respond rapidly change need requiring flexible
Due development agile method emerged
In essence agile method nature work short feedback development cycle involve customer tightly software development process
The main principle guided development different agile practice eXtreme programming Beck SCRUM Schwaber summarized agile manifesto AgileManifesto
As shown systematic review agile received much attention research community
While agile became popular lean software development emerged publication book Poppendieck Poppendieck proposes way practice lean manufacturing could applied software engineering context
Lean strong focus removing waste development process
everything contribute customer value
Furthermore according lean development process looked perspective avoid
The aim similar success lean software development case manufacturing
That delivering customer really need short time
Both development paradigm agile lean seem similar goal focusing customer responding need rapid manner
Though well understood distinguishes paradigm
In order make best use paradigm important understand difference similarity two main reason Research result principle practice process shared paradigm beneficial understand usefulness paradigm
This aid generalizing aggregating research result determine benefit limitation lean well agile time
The understanding difference show opportunity paradigm complement
For instance one principle lean applied agile might valuable addition
The comparison based general description paradigm
In particular chapter make following contribution Aggregation lean agile principle explicit mapping principle practice
A comparison showing overlap difference principle regarding different aspect paradigm
A linkage practice principle paradigm well investigation whether practice considered part either lean agile paradigm
The remainder chapter structured follows Section present background lean agile software development
Section compare paradigm respect goal principle practice process

rapid application development RAD describes set value principle requirement solution evolve collaborative effort
It advocate adaptive planning evolutionary development early delivery continuous improvement encourages rapid flexible response change
These principle support definition continuing evolution many
The term sometimes written popularized defines value principle
Agile continue evolve two widely used
Iterative incremental software development method traced back
Evolutionary project management adaptive software development emerged early
During number software development method evolved reaction prevailing method critic described heavily regulated planned
These included DSDM Crystal Clear XP
Although originated publication collectively referred agile software development method
At time similar change underway manufacturing aerospace
In seventeen software developer met resort discus lightweight development method among others
Together published
In group headed wrote addendum principle guide software project management according agile software development method
In movement wrote extension principle guide agile software development according conduct mastery
In Agile Alliance created Guide Agile Practices renamed Agile Glossary evolving compendium working definition agile practice term element along interpretation experience guideline worldwide community agile practitioner
Based combined experience developing software helping others seventeen signatory manifesto proclaimed value That value item right value item left
By term meant Some author formed Agile Alliance organization promotes software development according manifesto value principle
Introducing manifesto behalf Agile Alliance said The Agile movement fact many u want restore credibility word methodology
We want restore balance
We embrace modeling order file diagram dusty corporate repository
We embrace documentation hundred page tome
We plan recognize limit planning turbulent environment
Those would brand proponent XP SCRUM Agile Methodologies hacker ignorant methodology original definition term hacker
The based twelve principle Most agile development method break product development work small increment minimize amount planning design
Iterations sprint short time frame typically last one four week
Each iteration involves working function
At end iteration working product demonstrated stakeholder
This minimizes overall risk allows product adapt change quickly
An iteration might add enough functionality warrant market release goal available release minimal end iteration
Multiple iteration might required release product new feature
Working software primary measure progress
No matter development method followed every team include Product Owner Scrum
This person agreed stakeholder act behalf make personal commitment available developer answer question throughout iteration
At end iteration stakeholder customer representative review progress priority view optimizing ROI ensuring alignment customer need company goal
In agile software development normally large physical display located prominently near development team see
It present summary product development status
A may also used inform team current status product development
A common characteristic agile software development also known
In brief session team member report previous day toward team iteration goal intend today toward goal roadblock impediment see goal
Specific tool technique automated technique often used improve quality enhance product development agility
Compared traditional software engineering agile software development mainly target complex system product development dynamic characteristic
Accurate estimate stable plan prediction often hard get early stage confidence likely low
Agile practitioner seek reduce needed evidence value obtained
Requirements design held emergent
Big specification would probably cause lot waste case economically sound
These basic argument previous industry experience learned year success failure helped shape agile development favor adaptive iterative evolutionary development
Development method exist continuum
Agile software development method lie side continuum
One key adaptive development method approach schedule planning identifies milestone leaf flexibility path reach also allows milestone change
method focus adapting quickly changing reality
When need project change adaptive team change well
An adaptive team difficulty describing exactly happen future
The away date vague adaptive method happen date
An adaptive team report exactly task next week feature plan next month
When asked release six month adaptive team might able report mission statement release statement expected value cost
method contrast focus analysing planning future detail cater known risk
In extreme predictive team report exactly feature task planned entire length development process
Predictive method rely effective early phase analysis go wrong project may difficulty changing direction
Predictive team often institute ensure consider valuable change
used choose adaptive predictive method
suggest side continuum follows One difference agile software development method waterfall approach quality testing
In always separate however agile software development testing completed iteration programming
Because testing done every develops small piece frequently use new piece software validate value
After user know real value updated piece software make better decision software future
Having value retrospective software session typically iteration two team continuously adapt plan maximize value delivers
This follows pattern similar cycle work review retrospective change agreed upon
This iterative approach support rather mindset
This provides greater flexibility throughout development process whereas project requirement defined locked beginning making difficult change later
Iterative product development allows software evolve response change business environment market requirement
Because short iteration style agile software development also strong connection concept
In letter Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism agile software development calling yet another attempt undermine discipline software engineering translating Working software comprehensive documentation We want spend time coding
Remember real programmer write documentation
This disputed proponent agile software development state developer write documentation best way achieve relevant goal often better way achieve goal writing static documentation
state documentation Just Barely Good Enough JBGE much comprehensive documentation would usually cause waste developer rarely trust detailed documentation usually sync code little documentation may also cause problem maintenance communication learning knowledge sharing
wrote method Crystal considers development series game intends documentation enough help next win next game
The work product Crystal include use case risk list iteration plan core domain model design note inform choice however template document description necessarily vague objective clear next game
I always tend characterize team would want know joined team tomorrow
Agile software development method support broad range
Some focus practice XP pragmatic programming agile modeling focus managing flow work Scrum Kanban
Some support activity requirement specification development FDD seek cover full development life cycle DSDM
Popular agile software development framework include limited Agile software development supported number concrete practice covering area like requirement design modeling coding testing planning risk management process quality etc
Some notable agile software development practice include The Agile Alliance provided comprehensive online guide applying agile practice
In literature different term refer notion method adaptation including tailoring fragment adaptation method engineering
Method tailoring defined A process capability human agent determine system development approach specific project situation responsive change dynamic interplay context intention method fragment
Potentially almost agile method suitable method tailoring
Even method used purpose successfully tailored context
considered distinguishing characteristic agile method traditional software development method latter relatively much rigid prescriptive
The practical implication agile method allow product development team adapt working practice according need individual product
Practices concrete activity product part method framework
At extreme level philosophy behind method consisting number principle could adapted Aydin
Some approach Scrum extreme programming make need method adaptation explicit
With framework one principle single process fit every product development rather practice tailored need product
Mehdi Mirakhorli proposes tailoring practice provides sufficient guideline adapting practice
designed customizing XP
This practice first proposed long research paper APSO workshop ICSE conference currently proposed applicable method customizing XP
Although specifically solution XP practice capability extending methodology
At first glance practice seems category static method adaptation experience RDP Practice say treated like dynamic method adaptation
The distinction static method adaptation dynamic method adaptation subtle
Scrum designed method tailoring
Schwaber note Scrum methodology need enhancing
That got trouble first place thinking problem perfect methodology
Effort center change enterprise needed
Bas Vodde reinforces statement suggesting Scrum like traditional large methodology require pick choose element
It basic top add additional element localise contextualise use
Agile software development widely seen highly suited certain type environment including small team expert working challenge limitation encountered adoption agile software development method large organization understood
In response range strategy pattern evolved overcoming challenge development effort developer distributed development team amongst challenge several recognised framework seek mitigate avoid challenge
There many conflicting viewpoint whether effective indeed fit definition agile development remains active ongoing area research
When agile software development applied distributed setting team dispersed across multiple business location commonly referred distributed agile development
The goal leverage unique benefit offered approach
Distributed development allow organization build software strategically setting team different part globe virtually building software commonly referred model
On hand agile development provides increased transparency continuous feedback flexibility responding change
Agile software development method initially seen best suitable product development thereby excluded use regulated domain medical device pharmaceutical financial nuclear system automotive avionics sector etc
However last several year several initiative adaptation agile method domain
There numerous standard may apply regulated domain including
A number key concern particular importance regulated domain The framework particular received considerable attention
Two derived method defined Regulated Scrum SafeScrum
Although agile software development method used programming paradigm language practice originally closely associated environment Smalltalk Lisp later Java
The initial adopter agile method usually small team working unprecedented system requirement difficult finalize likely change system developed
This section describes common problem organization encounter try adopt agile software development method well various technique measure quality performance agile team
Organizations team implementing agile software development often face difficulty transitioning traditional method team agile process forced
These often termed commonly
Below common example A goal agile software development focus producing working software le documentation
This contrast waterfall model process often highly controlled minor change system require significant revision supporting documentation
However justify completely without analysis design
Failure pay attention design cause team proceed rapidly first significant rework required attempt scale system
One key feature agile software development iterative
When done correctly design emerges system developed commonality opportunity discovered
In agile software development similar description typically used define requirement short period time team commits specific goal
Adding story iteration progress detrimental good flow work
These added product backlog prioritized subsequent iteration rare case iteration could cancelled
This mean story expand
Teams must deal new information may produce additional task story
If new information prevents story completed iteration carried subsequent iteration
However prioritized remaining story new information may changed story original priority
Agile software development often implemented grassroots effort organization software development team trying optimize development process ensure consistency software development life cycle
By sponsor support team may face difficulty resistance business partner development team management
Additionally may suffer without appropriate funding resource
This increase likelihood failure
A survey performed VersionOne found respondent cited insufficient training significant cause failed agile implementation Teams fallen trap assuming reduced process agile software development compared methodology waterfall mean actual rule agile software development
Agile software development set prescribed methodology requirement
The responsible representing business development activity often demanding role
A common mistake product owner role filled someone development team
This requires team make decision prioritization without real feedback business
They try solve business issue internally delay work reach outside team direction
This often lead distraction breakdown collaboration
Agile software development requires team meet product commitment mean focus work product
However team member appear spare capacity often expected take work make difficult help complete work team committed
Teams may fall trap spending much time preparing planning
This common trap team le familiar agile software development team feel obliged complete understanding specification story
Teams prepared move forward story confidence iteration continue discover prepare work subsequent iteration often referred grooming
A daily standup focused timely meeting team member disseminate information
If occurs often involve certain team member potentially best use entire team time
If daily standup team start diving set aside discus usually immediately standup completes
One intended benefit agile software development empower team make choice closest problem
Additionally make choice close implementation possible use timely information decision
If team member assigned task others early process benefit localized timely decision making lost
Being assigned work also constrains team member certain role example team member A must always database work limit opportunity
Team member choose take task stretch ability provide opportunity
Another common pitfall scrum master act contributor
While prohibited Scrum methodology scrum master need ensure capacity act role scrum master first working development task
A scrum master role facilitate process rather create product
Having scrum master also multitasking may result many context switch productive
Additionally scrum master responsible ensuring roadblock removed team make forward progress benefit gained individual task moving forward may outweigh roadblock deferred due lack capacity
Due iterative nature agile development multiple round testing often needed
Automated testing help reduce impact repeated unit integration regression test free developer tester focus higher value work
Test automation also support continued required iterative software development
Allowing developer quickly run test confirm refactoring modified functionality application may reduce workload increase confidence cleanup effort introduced new defect
Focusing delivering new functionality may result increased
The team must allow time defect remediation refactoring
Technical debt hinders planning ability increasing amount unscheduled work production defect distract team progress
As system evolves important entropy system naturally increase
Over time lack constant maintenance cause increasing defect development cost
A common misconception agile software development allows continuous change however iteration backlog agreement work completed iteration
Having much result inefficiency queueing
The team must avoid feeling pressured taking additional work
Agile software development fix time iteration duration quality ideally resource advance though maintaining fixed resource may difficult developer often pulled away task handle production incident scope remains variable
The customer product owner often push fixed scope iteration
However team reluctant commit locked time resource scope commonly known
Efforts add scope fixed time resource agile software development may result decreased quality
The best agile practitioner always emphasized sound engineering principle
As result number best practice tool measuring performance agile software development team
The amongst others rate development five dimension product development duration risk novelty effort interaction
Other technique based measurable goal one study suggests used metric agility
There also agile determine whether team using agile software development practice Nokia test Karlskrona test point test
One early study reporting gain quality productivity business satisfaction using agile software development method survey conducted Shine Technologies November January
A similar survey State Agile conducted every year starting thousand participant around software development community
This track trend benefit agility lesson learned good practice
Each survey reported increasing number saying agile software development help deliver software faster improves ability manage changing customer priority increase productivity
Surveys also consistently shown better result agile product development method compared classical project management
In balance report feel agile development method still young enable extensive academic research success
The term agile management applied iterative incremental method managing design build activity engineering information technology business area aim provide new product service development highly flexible interactive manner based principle expressed
Agile X technique may also called
It variant submitted stage
The main difference agile iterative development agile method complete small portion deliverable delivery cycle iteration iterative method evolve entire set deliverable time completing near end project
Both iterative agile method developed reaction various obstacle developed sequential form project organization
For example technology project grow complexity end user tend difficulty defining long term requirement without able view progressive prototype
Projects develop iteration constantly gather feedback help refine requirement
Agile management also offer simple framework promoting communication reflection past amongst member
Teams using traditional waterfall planning adopted agile way development typically go transformation phase often take help agile coach help guide team smooth transformation
There typically two style agile coaching
Agile management approach also employed adapted within business government sector
For example within USAID employing collaborative project management approach focus incorporating CLA strategy iterate adapt programming
Agile method mentioned Project Lifecycle definition project life cycle also known agile method intended facilitate change require high degree ongoing involvement
Adaptive life cycle also iterative incremental differ iteration rapid usually week length fixed time
According Richet Research Fellow Institute Strategic Innovation Services approach leveraged effectively product project management general especially area innovation uncertainty
The end result product project best meet current customer need delivered minimal cost waste time enabling company achieve bottom line gain earlier via traditional approach
Agile software development method extensively used development software product use certain characteristic software object technology
However technique applied development product computer motor vehicle medical device food clothing music see
Agile software development method used
Some wider principle agile software development also found application general management strategy governance risk finance term agile business management
Under agile business management model agile software development technique practice principle value expressed across five domain
Agile software development paradigm used area life raising child
Its success child development might founded basic management principle communication adaptation awareness
Bruce Feiler claimed basic agile development paradigm applied household management raising child
In TED Talk Agile programming family paradigm brought significant change household environment kid dish taking trash decreasing child emotional outbreak inadvertently increased emotional stability
Agile methodology inefficient large organization certain type development
Many organization believe agile software development methodology extreme adopt hybrid approach mix element agile software development approach
Some method DSDM attempt disciplined way without sacrificing fundamental principle
The term Agile also criticized simply describes existing good practice new jargon promotes one size fit mindset towards development strategy wrongly emphasizes method result
organized celebration anniversary Snowbird Utah February gathering people involved original meeting since
A list undiscussable agile collected including aspect alliance failure limitation agile software development practice context possible cause commercial interest decontextualization obvious way make progress based failure limited objective evidence cognitive bias reasoning fallacy politics culture
As wrote The agile movement way bit like teenager checking constantly appearance mirror accepting criticism interested peer rejecting en bloc wisdom past past adopting fad new jargon time cocky arrogant
But I doubt mature become open outside world reflective also therefore effective

Distributed Pair Programming In distributed pair programming two person developing code different geographical location follows principal pair programming share single machine instance develop software
According two person involved one called driver another person called navigator
Driver control computer coding
Another person called navigator check code check logic code give advice driver constantly check whether team going correct direction
Typically driver navigator interchange role interval minute
There several way distributed remote pair programming performed According Baheti et al
chat room common widely used
Here two person involved remote pair programming use available chat service yahoo MSN AOL
Authors also mention shared software artifact used overcome disadvantage chat room ambiguity expressing complex process via chat difficulty faced one party give explanation delay incurred
There various software artifact used remote pair programming environment
According Schenk et al
VNC Adobe Connect Skype Microsoft NetMeeting used remote programming environment
Other tool distributed IDEs allow user save file local memory change file synced accordingly
Both Users share cursor view scrolling typing etc
According Sangam Xpairtise strict remote pair programming environment
In one person allowed code view synchronized two partner
In Use hardware graphic collaboration author mention generally used data visualization purpose rather software development purpose
Here purpose create collaborative theatre simultaneously display content theatre screen visualize high dimensional scientific data
Jazz Sangam A tool support remote pair programming Jazz Sangam Jazz software development tool support collaboration developed IBM
It feature source control instant messaging team process defect management
Jazz Sangam extension Sanagam remote pair programming plug Eclipse IDE
Jazz us client server architecture specific focus different collaborative technology
The architecture jazz highly extensible us open web standard
This tool three main feature Jazz source control Work Items Chat
It implement version control system subversion
The developer manage local change see change made real time
Jazz Sangam bug tracking system call Work Items similar BugZilla
Jazz Sangam Chat View configured Google Talk OpenFire server etc
These feature enhance experience remote pair programming additional feature
The pitfall remote pair programming according would challenging develop cross workspace infrastructure isomorphic
However several tool developed exactly mimic isomorphic behavior
However according inability partner express logic verbally issue increase required amount time develop software
However tool support video audio integration lead higher consumption memory bandwidth
Other pitfall could inability express complex conceptual logic without whiteboard
The potential solution could integrate virtual whiteboard development environment Microsoft NetMeeting work well case
Answer There seven lean principle software development Following step followed Organization A follows Waterfall Model incorporate lean principle
Eliminate Waste Some reason causing waste software development according partially completed work
defect constantly changing requirement
These waste generally caused boundary different function due lost knowledge delay
The organization try deliver frequent iteration retrospective meeting iteration asking went wrong

Amplify Learning According increasing feedback customer incorporated testing immediately followed coding defect stack
Allow decide late possible policy explore available option enough knowledge available

Decide late possible According principle put emphasis breadth first search instead depth first search
Breadth first search includes exploring various option instead drilling deep one single topic unlike waterfall model
They consider top highest feature try decide late possible enough knowledge available delaying decision make thing worse

Deliver fast possible According organization try deliver product faster compared traditional waterfall model
Iterative waterfall model used give frequent deliverable customer
In first iteration include minimum requirement iteratively frequent build used based customer feedback

Empower team This principle emphasis allowing team make decision defines task management help support team
Allow team make commitment stage waterfall development lifecycle keep staff motivated purpose

Build Integrity Within Build product frequent iteration allow customer test product iterative waterfall small iteration frequent delivery
Allow developer customer talk hence understand requirement easily information flow bidirectional small size

See thing Whole As previously stated start minimum requirement add module
Ensure module defect also perform regression testing
Measurements taken optimize team whole waterfall model coding section team collaborate find new thing
Some step followed Organization B us SCRUM

Eliminate Waste It duty scrum master identify waste eliminated team categorizes two type
The waste eliminated
Waste require effort remove
Scrum master approach team suggestion improvement

Amplify Learning In scrum sprint team retrospective meeting understand went well
They add feature iteration backlog going implemented next sprint limit WIP Work Progress item increase productivity development

Decide late possible Put larger le defined task iteration backlog developed detail definition information available product enough knowledge gained

Deliver fast possible Continuous integration feature used instead integration week scrum team build product faster short sprint time deliver customer frequently

Empower team Instead working many item one time must work
While switching various task trying focus many different thing time lead become overloaded overwhelmed hence individual team member must motivated task

Build Integrity Within Using automated testing environment following test driven development change way team think scrum turn process requirement validation requirement generation

See thing Whole The team member collaborate various phase explore try improve collaboration
And collaboration increase collective knowledge software increase team member get insight responsibility

November updated November
Anderson describes Lean Software Development
Lean software development project management Team Foundation Server The term Lean Software Development first coined title conference organized ESPRIT initiative European Union Stuttgart Germany October
Independently following year Robert Charette suggested concept Software part work exploring better way managing risk software project
The term date suggested James Womack Daniel Jones Daniel Roos book English language term describe management approach used Toyota
The idea Lean might applicable software development established early year term first used association trend manufacturing process industrial engineering
In book published Womack Jones defined five core pillar Lean Thinking
These Value Value Stream Flow Pull Perfection This became default working definition Lean next decade
The pursuit perfection suggested achieved eliminating waste
While pillar one pursuit perfection systemic identification wasteful activity elimination really resonated wide audience
Lean became almost exclusively associated practice elimination waste late early part Century
The Womack Jones definition Lean shared universally
The principle management Toyota far subtle
The single word English described richly three Japanese term Muda literally meaning implying activity Mura meaning interpreted Muri meaning Perfection pursued reduction activity also smoothing flow elimination overburdening
In addition Toyota approach based foundational respect people heavily influenced teaching century quality assurance statistical process control expert Edwards Deming
Unfortunately almost many definition Lean author subject
Bob Charette invited unable attend meeting Snowbird Utah Manifesto Agile Software Development authored
Despite missing historic meeting Lean Software Development considered one several Agile approach software development
Jim Highsmith dedicated chapter book interview Bob topic
Later Mary Tom Poppendieck went author series book
During first year Century Lean principle used explain Agile method better
Lean explained Agile method contained little hence produced better economic outcome
Lean principle used adopt Agile method
In recent year Lean Software Development really emerged discipline related specifically subset Agile movement
This evolution started synthesis idea Lean Product Development work Donald Reinertsen idea emerging world large scale system engineering writing James Sutton Peter Middleton
I also synthesized work Eli Goldratt Edwards Deming developed focus flow rather waste reduction
At behest Reinertsen around I introduced use kanban system limit new work system ready process
Alan Shalloway added thought Lean software development book topic
Since emergence Lean new force progress software development profession focused improving flow managing risk improving management decision making
Kanban become major enabler Lean initiative work
It appears focus flow rather focus waste elimination proving better catalyst continuous improvement within knowledge work activity software development
Defining Lean Software Development challenging specific Lean Software Development method process
Lean equivalent Personal Software Process Spiral Model EVO Development Extreme Programming Scrum Development
A software development lifecycle process project management process could said observed aligned value Lean Software Development movement principle Lean Software Development
So anticipating simple recipe followed named Lean Software Development disappointed
You must fashion tailor software development process understanding Lean principle adopting core value Lean
There several school thought within Lean Software Development
The largest arguably leading school Lean Systems Society includes Donald Reinertsen Jim Sutton Alan Shalloway Bob Charette Mary Poppendeick David Anderson
Mary Tom work developed prior formation Society credo stand separately work Craig Larman Bas Vodde recently Jim Coplien
This article seek broadly representative Lean Systems Society viewpoint expressed credo provide synthesis summary idea
The Lean Systems Society published credo Lean Software Systems Conference
This based set value published year earlier
Those value include Accept human condition Accept complexity uncertainty natural knowledge work Work towards better Economic Outcome While enabling better Sociological Outcome Seek embrace question idea wide range discipline A community enhances speed depth positive change Knowledge work software development undertaken human being
We human inherently complex logical thinker also led emotion inherent animalistic trait reasonably overcome
Our psychology must taken account designing system process within work
Our social behavior must also accommodated
Humans inherently emotional social tribal behavior change fatigue stress
Successful process embrace accommodate human condition rather try deny assume logical behavior
The behavior customer market unpredictable
The flow work process collection worker unpredictable
Defects required rework unpredictable
There inherent chance seemingly random behavior many level within software development
The purpose goal scope project tend change delivered
Some uncertainty variability though initially unknown knowable sense studied quantified risk managed variability unknowable advance adequately anticipated
As result system Lean Software Development must able react unfolding event system must able adapt changing circumstance
Hence Lean Software Development process must exist within framework permit adaptation process unfolding event
Human activity Lean Software Development focused producing better economic outcome
Capitalism acceptable contributes value business benefit customer
Investors owner business deserve return investment
Employees worker deserve fair rate pay fair effort performing work
Customers deserve good product service delivers promised benefit exchange fair price paid
Better economic outcome involve delivery value customer lower cost managing capital deployed investor owner effective way possible
Better economic outcome delivered expense performing work
Creating workplace respect people accepting human condition provides system work respect psychological sociological nature people essential
Creating great place great work core value Lean Software Development community
The Lean Software Systems community seems agree principle underpin Lean Software Development process
Follow Systems Thinking Design Approach Emergent Outcomes Influenced Architecting Context Complex Adaptive System Respect People part system Use Scientific Method drive improvement Encourage Leadership Generate Visibility work workflow system operation Reduce Flow Time Reduce Waste Improve Efficiency This often referred Lean literature whole implies output entire system process desire optimize mistakenly optimize part hope magically optimize whole
Most practitioner believe corollary true optimizing part local optimization lead suboptimal outcome
A Lean Systems Thinking Design Approach requires consider demand system made external stakeholder customer desired outcome required stakeholder
We must study nature demand compare capability system deliver
Demand include demand customer willing pay demand typically rework additional demand caused failure supply value demand
Failure demand often take two form rework previously delivered value demand additional service support due failure supplying value demand
In software development failure demand typically request bug fix request customer care help desk function
A system design approach requires also follow PDSA approach process design improvement
Edwards Deming used word imply study natural philosophy behavior
This system consists software development process people operating
It observable behavior term lead time quality quantity feature function delivered referred Agile literature forth
These metric exhibit variability studying mean spread variation develop understanding capability
If mismatched demand customer expectation system need redesigned close gap
Deming also taught capability influenced system design contributed performance individual
In word respect people blaming gap capability compared demand redesigning system enable successful
To understand system design must scientific understanding dynamic system capability might affected
Models developed predict dynamic system
While many possible model several popular one common usage understanding economic cost transaction coordination cost relate production product service Theory Constraints understanding bottleneck The Theory Profound Knowledge study recognition variability either common system design special external system design
Complex system starting condition simple rule run iteratively produce emergent outcome
Emergent outcome difficult impossible predict given starting condition
The computer science experiment Game example complex system
A complex adaptive system within internal method reflection enables consider well current set rule enabling achieve desired outcome
The complex adaptive system may choose adapt change simple rule close gap current outcome desired outcome
The Game Life adapted rule could play would complex adaptive system
In software development process complex adaptive system policy make process definition
The core principle based belief developing software product service deterministic activity hence defined process adapt adequate response unforeseeable event
Hence process designed part system thinking design approach must adaptable
It adapts modification policy made
The Kanban approach Lean Software Development utilizes concept treating policy kanban pull system rule starting condition work workflow visualized flow managed using understanding system dynamic organization us scientific approach understanding proposing implementing process improvement
The Lean community adopts Peter definition knowledge work state worker knowledge worker knowledgeable work perform boss
This creates implication worker best placed make decision perform work modify process improve work performed
So voice worker respected
Workers empowered complete work achieve desired outcome
They also empowered suggest implement process improvement opportunity referred Lean literature
Making process policy explicit worker aware rule constrain another way respecting
Clearly defined rule encourage removing fear need courage
Respecting people empowering giving set explicitly declared policy hold true core value respecting human condition
Seek use model understand dynamic work done system Lean Software Development operating
Observe study system capability develop apply model predicting behavior
Collect quantitative data study use data understand system performing predict might change process changed
The Lean Software Systems community us statistical method statistical process control chart spectral analysis histogram raw data lead time velocity understand system capability
They also use model Theory Constraints understand bottleneck The System Profound Knowledge understand variation internal system design versus externally influenced analysis economic cost form task performed merely coordinate set deliver clean product service created
Some model coming use Real Option Theory seek apply financial option theory financial risk management decision making
The scientific method suggests study postulate outcome based model perturb system based prediction observe see perturbation produced result model predicted
If check data reconsider whether model accurate
Using model drive process improvement move scientific activity elevates superstitious activity based intuition
Leadership management
Management activity designing process creating modifying deleting policy making strategic operational decision gathering resource providing finance facility communicating information context strategy goal desired outcome
Leadership vision strategy tactic courage innovation judgment advocacy many attribute
Leadership come anyone within organization
Small act leadership worker create cascade improvement deliver change needed create Lean Software Development process
Knowledge work invisible
If see something almost impossible manage
It necessary generate visibility work undertaken flow work network individual skill department complete
It necessary create visibility process design finding way visualizing flow process making policy process explicit everyone see consider
When thing visible use scientific method possible conversation potential improvement collaborative objective
Collaborative process improvement almost impossible work workflow invisible process policy explicit
The software development profession academic study software engineering traditionally focused measuring time spent working activity
The Lean Software Development community discovered might useful measure actual elapsed calendar time something take processed
This typically referred Cycle Time usually qualified boundary activity performed
For example Cycle Time Analysis Ready Deployment would measure total elapsed time work item user story analyzed designed developed tested several way queued ready deployment production environment
Focusing time work take flow process important several way
Longer cycle time shown correlate growth bug rate
Hence shorter cycle time lead higher quality
This seems ridiculous bug could inserted code queuing human actually touching
Traditionally software engineering profession academic study ignored idle time
However empirical evidence suggests cycle time important initial quality
Alan Shalloway also talked concept His observation lag performing task lead task taking lot effort may done
For example bug found fixed immediately may take minute fix bug triaged queued wait several day week fixed may involve several many hour make fix
Hence cycle time delay additional work
As work avoidable Lean term must seen The third reason focusing cycle time business related reason
Every feature function user story value
That value may uncertain nevertheless value
The value may vary time
The concept value varying time expressed economically market payoff function
When market payoff function work item understood even function exhibit spread value model uncertainty possible evaluate The cost delay allows u put value reducing cycle time
With work item market payoff function start known date future
For example feature designed used July holiday United States value prior date
Shortening cycle time capable predicting cycle time certainty still useful example
Ideally want start work feature delivered needed significantly prior desired date late late delivery incurs cost delay
delivery ensures optimal use made available resource
Early delivery implies might worked something else implication incurred opportunity cost delay
As result three reason Lean Software Development seek minimize flow time record data enables prediction flow time
The objective minimize failure demand bug waste due delay fixing bug maximize value delivered avoiding cost delay opportunity cost delay
For every activity setup cleanup delivery activity necessary add value right
For example project iteration develops increment working software requires planning setup activity environment perhaps code branch version control collectively known configuration management also setup activity release plan performing actual release delivery activity demonstration customer delivery activity perhaps environment teardown reconfiguration cleanup activity
In economic term setup cleanup delivery activity transaction cost performing work
These cost overhead considered waste Lean
Any form communication overhead considered waste
Meetings determine project status schedule assign work team member would considered coordination cost economic language
All coordination cost waste Lean thinking
Lean software development method seek eliminate reduce coordination cost use colocation team member short meeting standups visual control card wall
The third common form waste Lean Software Development failure demand
Failure demand burden system software development
Failure demand typically rework new form work generated poor quality
The typical form failure demand software development bug production defect customer support activity driven failure use software intended
The percentage failure demand often referred Failure Load
The percentage work failure demand measure efficiency system
The percentage work total work including adding transaction coordination cost determines level efficiency
A system transaction coordination cost failure load would considered efficient
Traditionally Western management science taught efficiency improved increasing batch size work
Typically transaction coordination cost fixed rise slightly increase batch size
As result large batch work efficient
This concept known economy scale
However knowledge work problem coordination cost tend rise batch size transaction cost often exhibit linear growth
As result traditional Century approach efficiency appropriate knowledge work problem like software development
It better focus reducing overhead keeping batch size small order improve efficiency
Hence Lean way efficient reduce waste
Lean software development method focus fast cheap quick planning method low communication overhead effective low overhead coordination mechanism visual control kanban system
They also encourage automated testing automated deployment reduce transaction cost delivery
Modern tool minimizing cost environment setup teardown modern version control system use virtualization also help improve efficiency small batch software development
Lean Software Development prescribe practice
It important demonstrate actual process definition aligned principle value
However number practice commonly adopted
This section provides brief overview
Cumulative Flow Diagrams standard part reporting Team Foundation Server since
Cumulative flow diagram plot area graph cumulative work item state workflow
They rich information used derive mean cycle time step process well throughput rate
Different software development lifecycle process produce different visual signature cumulative flow diagram
Practitioners learn recognize pattern dysfunction process displayed area graph
A truly Lean process show evenly distributed area color smoothly rising steady pace
The picture appear smooth without jagged step visible block color
In basic form cumulative flow diagram used visualize quantity given step work item lifecycle
This used detect bottleneck observe effect variability flow
In addition use cumulative flow diagram Lean Software Development team use physical board projection electronic visualization system visualize work observe flow
Such visualization help team member observe accumulating enable see bottleneck effect Visual control also enable team member pick work collaborate together without planning specific management direction intervention
These visual control often referred sometimes incorrectly A kanban system practice adopted Lean manufacturing
It us system physical card limit quantity given stage workflow
Such limited system create new work started free kanban indicating new work particular state work progress
In Lean Software Development kanban virtual often tracked setting maximum number given step workflow work item type
In implementation electronic system keep track virtual kanban provide signal new work started
The signal visual form alert email
Virtual kanban system often combined visual control provide visual virtual kanban system representing workflow one several work item type
Such system often referred kanban A visual virtual kanban system available Team Foundation Server called Visual WIP
This project developed open source Hakan Forss Sweden
Lean Software Development requires work either undertaken small batch often referred work item flow independently referred flow requires sophisticated configuration management strategy enable completed work delivered incomplete work released accidentally
This typically achieved using branching strategy version control system
A small batch work would typically considered batch undertaken small team people le week
Small batch flow require frequent interaction business owner replenish backlog queue work
They also require capability release frequently
To enable frequent interaction business people frequent delivery necessary shrink transaction coordination cost activity
A common way achieve use automation
Lean Software Development expects high level automation economically enable flow encourage high quality reduction failure demand
The use automated testing automated deployment software factory automate deployment design pattern creation repetitive low variability section source code commonplace Lean Software Development process
In Lean literature term kaizen mean kaizen event act making change process tool hopefully result improvement
Lean Software Development process use several different activity generate kaizen event
These listed
Each activity designed stimulate conversation problem adversely affect capability consequently ability deliver demand
The essence kaizen knowledge work must provoke conversation problem across group people different team different skill
Teams software developer often typically meet front visual control system whiteboard displaying visualization
They discus dynamic flow factor affecting flow work
Particular focus made externally blocked work work delayed due bug
Problems process often become evident series standup meeting
The result smaller group may remain meeting discus problem propose solution process change
A kaizen event follow
These spontaneous meeting often referred spontaneous quality circle older literature
Such spontaneous meeting heart truly kaizen culture
Managers encourage emergence kaizen event daily standup meeting order drive adoption Lean within organization
Project team may schedule regular meeting reflect recent performance
These often done specific project deliverable complete increment development known iteration sprint Agile software development
Retrospectives typically use anecdotal approach reflection asking question like went well would differently stop Retrospectives typically produce backlog suggestion kaizen event
The team may prioritize implementation
An operation review typically larger retrospective includes representative whole value stream
It common many department present objective quantitative data show demand received reflect capability deliver demand
Operations review typically held monthly
The key difference operation review retrospective operation review span wider set function typically span portfolio project initiative use objective quantitative data
Retrospectives comparison tend scoped single project involve team analysis development test generally anecdotal nature
An operation review provoke discussion dynamic affecting performance team
Perhaps one team generates failure demand processed another team
Perhaps failure demand disruptive cause second team miss commitment fail deliver expectation
An operation review provides opportunity discus issue propose change
Operations review typically produce small backlog potential kaizen event prioritized scheduled future implementation
There thing single Lean Software Development process
A process could said Lean clearly aligned value principle Lean Software Development
Lean Software Development prescribe practice activity become common
Lean organization seek encourage kaizen visualization workflow understanding dynamic flow factor bottleneck availability variability waste affect
Process improvement suggested justified way reduce source variability eliminate waste improve flow improve value delivery risk management
As Lean Software Development process always evolving uniquely tailored organization within evolve
It natural simply copy process definition one organization another expect work different context
It also unlikely returning organization week month find process use observed earlier
It always evolving
The organization using Lean software development process could said Lean exhibited small amount waste three form could shown optimizing delivery value effective management risk
The pursuit perfection Lean always journey
There destination
True Lean organization always seeking improvement
Lean Software Development still emerging field expect continue evolve next decade

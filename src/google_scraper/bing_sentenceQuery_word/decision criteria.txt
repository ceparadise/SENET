study reasoning underlying choice
Decision theory broken three branch decision theory give advice make given set uncertain belief set descriptive decision theory analyzes existing possibly irrational agent actually make decision prescriptive decision theory try guide give procedure order make line normative theory
Closely related field decision theory concerned choice individual agent whereas game theory concerned interaction agent whose decision affect
Decision theory interdisciplinary topic studied economist statistician psychologist biologist political social scientist philosopher computer scientist
Empirical application rich theory usually done help method especially via choice model model
Estimation model usually done via parametric method
prescriptive decision theory concerned identifying best decision make modelling ideal decision maker able compute perfect accuracy fully
The practical application prescriptive approach people make decision called aimed finding tool methodology software help people make better decision
In contrast descriptive decision theory concerned describing observed behavior assumption agent behaving consistent rule
These rule may instance procedural framework
elimination aspect model framework reconciling behavioral violation hypothesis may explicitly give functional form
Laibson
The prescription prediction behaviour positive decision theory produce allow test kind occurs practice
There thriving dialogue us laboratory field experiment evaluate inform theory
In recent decade also increasing interest sometimes called behavioral decision theory contributed rational requires
The area choice uncertainty represents heart decision theory
Known century invoked contained published idea faced number action could give rise one possible outcome different probability rational procedure identify possible outcome determine value positive negative probability result course action multiply two give expected value average expectation outcome action chosen one give rise highest total expected value
In published influential paper entitled us show expected value theory must wrong
He give example Dutch merchant trying decide whether insure cargo sent Amsterdam St Petersburg winter
In solution defines computes rather expected financial value see review
In century interest reignited paper pointing two central procedure namely special case general decision problem
Wald paper renewed synthesized many concept statistical theory including procedure
The phrase decision theory used
The revival theory work others extended scope expected utility theory situation subjective probability used
At time von Neumann Morgenstern theory proved expected utility maximization followed basic postulate rational behavior
The work showed human behavior systematic sometimes important departure maximization
The renewed empirical study le emphasis rationality presupposition
Kahneman Tversky found three regularity actual human loss loom larger gain person focus focus absolute utility estimation subjective probability severely biased
Intertemporal choice concerned kind choice different action lead outcome realised different point time
If someone received windfall several thousand dollar could spend expensive holiday giving immediate pleasure could invest pension scheme giving income time future
What optimal thing
The answer depends partly factor expected person confidence pension industry
However even factor taken account human behavior deviate greatly prediction prescriptive decision theory leading alternative model example objective interest rate replaced
Some decision difficult need take account people situation respond decision taken
The analysis social decision often treated label rather decision theory though involves mathematical method
From standpoint game theory problem treated decision theory game one player viewed playing impersonal background situation
In emerging engineering research especially focused different type distributed human organization normal situation
Other area decision theory concerned decision difficult simply complexity complexity organization make
Individuals making decision may limited resource finite time intelligence case issue deviation real optimal behaviour difficulty determining optimal behaviour first place
One example model economic growth resource usage developed help politician make decision complex situation
Decisions also affected whether option framed together separately known
The heuristic approach make decision based routine thinking quicker processing open risk introducing inaccuracy mistake fallacy may easily disproved process thinking
One example common incorrect thought process believing random event affected previous random event truth fifty percent chance coin landing head even long sequence tail
Another example may biased towards preferring moderate alternative extreme one Compromise Effect operates mindset driven belief moderate option amid extreme carry benefit extreme
A highly controversial issue whether one replace use probability decision theory alternative
Advocates use probability theory point The proponent maintain probability one many alternative point many example alternative implemented apparent success notably probabilistic decision theory assumption probability various event rule make assumption
A general criticism decision theory based fixed universe possibility considers known unknown focus expected variation unforeseen event argue outsized impact must considered significant event may outside model
This line argument called inevitable imperfection modeling real world particular model unquestioning reliance model blind one limit

Although Arrhenius first identified greenhouse effect late century late century United Nations Environment Programme PNUMA World Meteorological Organization OMM Intergovernmental Panel Change Climate IPCC developed
The IPCC developed initial report Working Group indicated veracity global warming result thereof international community became aware impact high emission level greenhouse gas atmosphere United Nations World Meteorological Organization
With aim stabilizing concentration greenhouse gas atmosphere level would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference climate system famous Earth Summit held Rio de Janeiro United Nations
However development Kyoto Protocol United Nations limit set net greenhouse emission major developed country economy transition reference emission defining first commitment period
Before end period validity agreed Kyoto summit held Doha late United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change attempt made reach new commitment among country although agreement positive given global economic situation small number country agreed extend time signed Kyoto Protocol year
Chronological evolution major advance fight climate change From Kyoto protocol favorable legislative framework developed set series policy measure including notably increased use renewable energy source
The European Union recognized need effective management available resource balanced fuel mix energy source performed role order support sustainable economic growth
Therefore Commission European Communities held Brussels Green Paper introduced marked ambitious target consisting achieving contribution RES close gross inland energy consumption
The Green Paper first stage establishing strategy energy source renewable source
It intended open debate urgent necessary measure could undertaken European Community Member States well nature measure
Based feedback observation consultation Member States EU institution European Commission published White Paper set common approach energy source renewable source accompanied action plan
Strategic plan action White Paper headed towards goal achieving greater penetration energy source European Union reaching
That meant overall objective European Union States encourage increased source energy renewable source according potential
Before end new European regulatory framework Directive defined national mandatory target established involved reaching share energy renewable source European Community energy consumption

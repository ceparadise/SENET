This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

An network local area network built spontaneously node connect
Rather depending base station coordinate message flow node network packet forwarded individual network node
MANET
mobile network consist node connected wireless manner
Intercommunication node MANET might happen fashion hence intermediate node source destination act host router
Zone Routing Protocol ZRP combination proactive reactive routing protocol maintains valid routing without much overhead
But ZRP When period time first route searching occurrence next data packet sending request short considered Destination Node DN move movement distance DN small
In situation sending route searching packet direction network resource decreased
In order overcome drawback ZRP introduced AZRP
In AZRP Advanced Zone Routing Protocol instead sending route searching packet direction first node check old packet
remaining TTL
If remaining TTL le
TTL packet started packet forwarded next node per routing table maintained receiving node
INTRODUCTION Mobile wireless network infrastructure called Networks
The intermediate node source destination wireless Networks job routing data packet one node another
Thus say intermediate node act router
Since intermediate node act router routing protocol play vital role MANETS
In network frequent change topology connection node established dynamically
Hence network large number routing protocol
These protocol classified two type also called known routing protocol
routing protocol maintains update topology change form table entire network
This information topology help find route source destination immediately data transport source destination fast
Table driven protocol two type Link based based
routing protocol converse routing protocol
It maintain information topology network
The routing protocol used routing protocol Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm TORA Dynamic Source Routing DSR Distance Vector AODV protocol
A reply packet sent back reverse path DSR AODV path found
The difference two protocol DSR reply sent source based address available query packet
But AODV reply packet sent next node
TORA quite opposite create acyclic graph destination flood
THE ZONE ROUTING PROTOCOL ZRP The draw back routing protocol us excess bandwidth order maintain routing information flooding data
Hence overcome draw back routing protocol Hybrid protocol introduced called ZRP Zone Routing Protocol
As name specifies ZRP Zone based routing protocol
All node network divided zone
The division based zone radius denoted r
This zone radius say number hop node zone maximum r
The key concept ZRP Routing Protocol IARP Routing Protocol IERP
In IARP use routing protocol IERP use routing protocol
Hence ZRP called Hybrid routing protocol
There different type node ZRP Peripheral node Interior node
Peripheral node node maximum distance r Interior node distance le r
In figure shown G C I called Interior node E J D B H called Peripheral node
Each node ZRP maintains information route node within routing zone exchanging periodic route update packet
The source node data send broadcast Rout Request Packet node single hop distance
Fig
Routing zone zone In diagram A want send data K node another zone
The A node first check destination node present current zone
If destination node present source node get Request reply packet destination node
If node present current zone A node broadcast Route Request packet peripheral node zone
E D H E J
Peripheral node check destination node present network
If node present send Request reply destination else send Route Request packet next zone peripheral node
While sending route request every node forward route request packet adding address
Hence source may receive different route reply packet choose best path send packet
But drawback ZRP IERP request packet broadcasted node may lead congestion
If period route searching next packet send low mean destination node movement le moment
But still send route searching packet direction
It may decrease network resource
It lead congestion packet loss
In order overcome packet loss ZRP introducing time live field packet
As packet pass one node another network TTL value packet decreasing
A packet arrived node TTL value field le node mark packet high priority packet forward immediately next node reach destination TTL value packet get expired
IARP Intra Zone Routing Protocol The IARP Intra Zone Routing Protocol reserved scope proactive routing protocol used support primary global routing protocol
Here node within zone record information destination node realize proactive routing
Tracking local network connectivity provides support route acquiring route maintenance
The Source node sends IARP packet neighbouring node node turn update routing table referring receives IARP packet
Routing table contains information like destination address subnet mask route list route metric list
The IARP packet information changed node incrementing hop count updated IARP packet transmitted ahead
Depending zone radius repeat procedure till reach zone radius
One information maintained routing table TTL parameter
If particular packet fails reach destination allocated TTL particular packet discarded maintain node movement
IERP IntEr Zone routing protocol As discussed earlier reactive protocol carried node beyond zone
Reactive routing protocol two phase route request phase route reply phase
To find intended destination node route request packet forwarded neighbouring node
After receiving route request revert back using route reply
If neighbouring node transmit route request packet forward ahead
In case one node receiving one route request considered redundant discarded
Any node reach destination reply request
Figure Routing Zone node S Now consider figure source node S want transmit packet node X
Zone radius
Since node X outside zone use IERP IntEr Zone routing protocol request packet broadcasted find route till destination
At node I route request packet transmitted reach intended destination
Figure show zone radius nod I
Figure Routing Zone node I Again node I find destination node routing table consequently forward route request packet
Finally route request packet reach node I whose routing table contains entry intended destination node
The routing table point updated reversed path node X node S node I send back
Figure Routing Zone node T Problem Definition Though ZRP us reactive proactive protocol real time traffic data transmission happen many time Destination node increasing congestion
Sometimes even though destination node near sender node broadcast route request packet neighboring node decreasing efficiency network
Limitations ZRP ZRP protocol
In case reactive protocol IERP packet transmitted border node IERP packet necessary route searching
Though packet required route search packet may also become cause congestion lead deprecated network performance
In real time scenario data transmission take place destination node DN
In scenario ZRP route search carried direction
From time span first route search transmission next data packet sending request short case assumed destination movement small
affecting transmission
In scenario transmission route probing packet consume network resource ultimately lead decrease network resource
Fig
Network Structure Fig
IERP Proposed Work AZRP Behavior To overcome downside ZRP proposed Threshold Value TV parameter determine eminence proposed AZRP
When Threshold Value high packet transmitted directly regardless route searching
Doing save congestion ultimately affect performance protocol
In contrary Threshold value consumes TTL case route search limited direction carried packet transmission
When Threshold value low route searching performed direction transmission packet
Every node maintains routing table record time
While search route node comprises antiquity number latest oldest heft value corresponding antiquity number probing value success failure delay time route search reception time reply packet
Working AZRP In routing protocol data request send packet occurs node look whether destination node exists zone
If node exists case data packet delivered destination using routing table
In ZRP IERP packet transmitted node existing border node
While case AZRP antiquity number greater equal Threshold Value calculated basis route searching antiquity
If value compared already set threshold line basis searching method altered per value
Fig
Transmission IERP packet The packet received node header checked parameter status probe
If parameter marked false packet considered safe zone transmitted without carrying route search basis table already maintained node
On reaching next node status probe parameter checked false threshold value computed check whether TTL consumed
If consumed case parameter set true route searching selected number route TTL greater le transferred next node
In case threshold go total TTL specific node probe route direction transmits packet route shortest according new table also reliable checked using rest four entry antiquity table
In case TTL cross maximum value packet discarded
On reception packet destination node acknowledgement sent source tracing back route source packet came
Fig
Transmission reply packet Conclusion In paper proposed zone based routing protocol MANET called AZRP evaluated real environment
From evaluation result conclude follows
By using AZRP
IERP packet could decreased compared ZRP
The transmission success rate network throughput AZRP could improved ZRP

Distributed system system consisting multiple processor connect network communicate
To manage communication different node exchange data leader among required
In project implement various Election algorithm choosing leader Distributed Systems thus solving coordinator election problem
We also comparing performance election algorithm
First implemented Election algorithm using message passing interface MPI
Then measured compared performance election algorithm simulated result
Finally modified distributed leader election algorithm suit mobile network
Key Words Distributed Systems Election algorithm Unidirectional ring algorithm Lelann algorithm Chang Roberts algorithm Bidirectional ring Leader election Mobile Adhoc Networks It group processor memory clock shared
Every processor associated memory information exchanged communication network
A distributed algorithm algorithm run distributed system assuming central coordinator system
So algorithm require one process act coordinator
There way select one leader process alike without different characteristic
One process take special responsibility matter process take
This problem leader elected termed coordinator election problem choose process among different processor make central coordinator
An election algorithm used solve coordinator election problem distributed system
Any election algorithm must distributed algorithm nature coordinator election problem
The important feature election algorithm assumes every process Unique ID
It vote process among different processor act initiator sequencer monitor detecting solving situation like Deadlock Mutual Exclusion etc
Thus electing leader process become major issue wired ad hoc network
The goal election algorithm see election begin end process agreement new coordinator
A ring formed process ring algorithm

Distributed Computing implementing MPI
The name identifier large processor contained register ID maintained processor Boolean register DIR direction ring processor still smaller processor election
A smaller candidate still alive message one name Large candidate created sent direction
Processors begin chase known active left processor observant
To get rid smaller candidate force agreement larger candidate main idea behind chase
After current active processor begun chase observant processor basically relay message onwards unless notice unusual situation ring
As algorithm proceeds two unusual situation arise location observant processor
They The processor receives message current phase say left link contains value le current value ID register
The processor turn active increment phase number initiate chase value current ID direction message received left link
ii Two message phase received processor opposite direction
The processor turn active increment phase number initiate chase largest value contained two message direction smallest
As algorithm proceeds several active processor arise phase rapidly decrease end single processor left precisely
This processor familiar receives two message phase opposite direction hold value elected either receives message current phase value exactly alike one sent stored ID register receives two message phase opposite direction hold value
ALGORITHM The algorithm describes action arbitrary processor bidirectional ring link required electing leader Let u executing processor identification number

The Time message complexity given MPI program process Messages Real time User time System time Table Leader election algorithm Bidirectional Ring A mobile ad hoc network dynamic nature
It composed set node exchange information within network wireless channel directly series link
A node independent move around fixed final topology
The node move freely geographical area loosely bounded transmission range wireless channel
Within transmission range mobile node communicates set node thus implying network
These set node also known neighbor communicating node
The mobile node act intermediary router direct packet source destination node set neighbor
A node designated leader coordinate information need exchanged among node charge data requirement
The identification problem leader termed leader election problem
Why need select leader
When node set form adhoc network within whole communication happens
If topology network change dynamically node may suspend communication previous node like distributed network
So risen need leader maintenance network clock synchronization within done
Also new leader chosen every time member group getting updated communication taking place
When communicating node move freely within transmission range wireless network fails
Similarly formation wireless link happen node separated far communicate move within transmission range one another
The network topology may change rapidly unpredictably time since node mobile
So developing efficient distributed algorithm adhoc network challenging work done
The largest identity node chosen leader using minimum wireless message approach
A mobile ad hoc network considered static network frequent link node failure thought mobile node adhoc network going reach
To cover node network use diameter concept
While distance described shortest path node diameter defined longest distance two node network
The number hop taken measuring distance assumption network becomes stable change happens leader election process limited number change network
A network N node considered
Since topological change considered leader election algorithm take diameter round terminate
If however topological change considered diameter round taken elect leader
We used algorithm mentioned An Efficient Leader Election Algorithm Mobile Adhoc Networks Pradeep Vijay implementing MPI
Each node propagates unique identifier neighbor maximum identifier elected leader every round
This maximum identifier propagated subsequent round
All round need synchronized
idlist identifies identifier list node consists neighbor node Lid idlist At round diameter node If identifier idlist node stop sending maximum identifier chooses maximum identifier idlist leader
The algorithm get terminated node element idlist node
The termination may final part diameter round If identifier idlist leader
Each node network two component idlist identifier list b Lid leader id node
Each node say node transmits unique identifier first round Lid subsequent round neighbor id stored idlist
Lid max idlist A unique leader elected diameter round topological change network
The algorithm modified incorporate topological change round description algorithm modified
If node outgoing link lid If node leaf round neighbor would know
Suppose node leaf network round r let neighbor j neighbor
j k
Delete ilist idlist j k delete ilist idlist ilist contains group identifier node sent neighbor round r along The ilist information also deleted neighbor j k ilist identifier propagated previous round
This process continues node network covered
Repeat round diameter Termination condition Compare identifier present idlist node
If identifier idlist equal node stop propagating maximum identifier elect maximum identifier leader
If new node join network round say round r neighbor update idlist
If neighbor say node j neighbor node
Add idlist j The normal algorithm continues id propagated node keep exchanging information till diameter round
Repeat round diameter For node network node j receives identifier diameter round
IF greater maximum identifier node j propagated previous round
Propagate node neighbor b Also propagate node information neighbor neighbor whole network covered condition satisfies
Else propagate information node network Compare identifier present idlist If identifier idlist equal node stop propagating maximum identifier elect maximum identifier leader
ii All node network follow process unique leader elected connected component
The time taken algorithm elect leader O diam Î Î time taken node converge Î depends topology change
The message complexity algorithm depends number round
In round sends message consider ring topology every node neighbor
So message complexity No

This algorithm implemented using MPI message complexity time complexity given MPI program process Messages Real time User time System time Table Leader Election Algorithm Mobile Adhoc Networks Message Complexity respect number process Time Messages Transferred Sno Algorithm LeLann Chang Roberts Bidirectional Ring MobileAdhoc message time complexity algorithm different number process implemented program result shown table
All simulation plotted graph analyze way different algorithm message complexity varies number process executes

Chang Robert algorithm made considerable change Lelann algorithm however worst case algorithm also requires O
For leader election ring topology two unidirectional algorithm considered
The bidirectional algorithm requires le message worst case Chang Roberts algorithm
It requires O N logN message
It take le time discover leader compared unidirectional algorithm since message sent direction
The final algorithm put effect mobile adhoc network run many round
The message complexity depends number round
It guarantee one leader time however handle partition network requires number message

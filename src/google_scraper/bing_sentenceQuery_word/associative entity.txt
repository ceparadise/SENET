What difference associative entity associative relationship attribute
In book titled Modern Database Management Hoffer edition author state difference two
Though really explain difference instead give example different
From I gather relationship attribute associated associative relationship attribute denoted dashed line rectangle attribute inside rectangle
Whereas associative entity attribute describe relationship
Both used relationship ER diagramming
Is thought process correct
Edit Also I forgot mention associative entity also attribute unique identifier least I think
An table associate two table many many relationship
An associative relationship attribute attribute associative entity exists many many relationship
Here example
Let suppose following table
Ok many many relationship User Permission
A user one permission permission shared many user
So create associative entity
The permission granted time stamp associative relationship attribute
It would fit User table Permission table
It attribute association
In ER diagramming M N relationship associative entity OR single associative attribute describe relationship
The difference associative entity must unique identifier associative attribute
According book associative entity must By posting answer agree

I currently designing database model I come across issue I like input considered proper way thing
In example I two table Persons Roles
Now person may assigned role
This pretty straight forward relationship tricky part come want allow user select role currently operating
Say user got selection role choose depending role currently chosen application present different view menu button etc
I see two solution See top part image linked In person table include nullable FK relationship association entity
From Wikipedia It seems ok entity reference relationship
I entirely sure includes Roles Persons entity
What I like design pretty easy get list allowed role person simply point one allowed role saying one
This also feel like good way make sure user role current access role Only I also see potential disaster What FK person table reference relationship another user
The DB design would allow
It would code prevents
See bottom part image linked I keep associative entity simple instead I FK person table point specific role Roles table
The problem I get even le help DB design ensuring current role person role actually allowed
Any thought would greatly appreciated UPDATE I include another variation issue
Two entity WorkOrders Sites So relationship The issue How best store database Site Owner work order Site Owns work order
Do OwnerSiteId column WorkOrder table would ok reference relationship instead saying one owner
If requirement yes design following pro con pro reduce join hence cost reduced database operation
Cons You assign user role never allowed list
I I go design ensure role assignment application
Store current role together session data

Can binary relationship intersection data
Explain

Can intersection data placed entity box one two entity relationship
Explain

What associative entity
How intersection data relate associative entity

In composed pair possible key appears collection
Operations associated data type allow The classic computer science problem task designing maintains set data operation
The two major solution dictionary problem
In case also possible solve problem using directly addressed specialized structure
Many programming language include associative array available many others
form direct support associative array
Associative array many application including fundamental
In associative array association key value often known binding word binding may also used refer process creating new association
The operation usually defined associative array Often instead add reassign single operation add new pair one already exist otherwise reassigns
In addition associative array may also include operation determining number binding constructing loop binding
Usually operation order binding returned may arbitrary
A generalizes associative array allowing multiple value associated single key
A related abstract data type binding operate direction value must associated unique key second lookup operation take value argument look key associated value
Suppose set loan made library represented data structure
Each book library may checked single library patron time
However single patron may able check multiple book
Therefore information book checked patron may represented associative array book key patron value
Using notation data structure would A lookup operation key Great Expectations would return John
If John return book would cause deletion operation Pat check book would cause insertion operation leading different state For dictionary small number binding may make sense implement dictionary using binding
With implementation time perform basic dictionary operation linear total number binding however easy implement constant factor running time small
Another simple implementation technique usable key restricted narrow range integer direct addressing array value given key stored array cell binding cell store special indicates absence binding
As well simple technique fast dictionary operation take constant time
However space requirement structure size entire keyspace making impractical unless keyspace small
The two major approach implementing dictionary
The frequently used general purpose implementation associative array combined separate key separate bucket array
The basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple operation
Therefore average overhead operation hash table computation key hash combined accessing corresponding bucket within array
As hash table usually perform O time outperform alternative situation
Hash table need able handle hash function map two different key bucket array
The two widespread approach problem
In separate chaining array store value store another container usually store value matching hash
On hand open addressing hash collision found table seek empty spot array store value deterministic manner usually looking next immediate position array
Open addressing lower ratio separate chaining table mostly empty
However table becomes filled element open addressing performance degrades exponentially
Additionally separate chaining us le memory case unless entry small le four time size pointer
Another common approach implement associative array
Compared hash table structure advantage weakness
The performance binary search tree significantly better hash table time complexity O log
This contrast hash table whose performance involves element sharing single bucket resulting O time complexity
In addition like binary search tree binary search tree keep element order
Thus traversing element follows pattern whereas traversing hash table result element seemingly random order
However hash table much better time complexity binary search tree O performance highly unlikely good used
It worth noting binary search tree used implement bucket hash table us separate chaining
This allows constant lookup assures performance O log
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element linked list similar data structure
Associative array may also stored unbalanced data structure specialized particular type key implementation method le efficient hash table well placing greater restriction type data handle
The advantage alternative structure come ability handle operation beyond basic one associative array finding binding whose key closest queried key query present set binding
Associative array implemented programming language package many language system provide part standard library
In language built standard system special syntax often using subscripting
syntactic support associative array introduced name table
made associative array optionally persistent key data structure
supported one possible implementation set map
Most modern scripting language starting including support associative array primary container type
In many language available library function without special syntax
In called called called see called since typically use implementation
In array associative except key limited integer string
In JavaScript see also object behave associative array key Map WeakMap type take arbitrary object key
In Lua called used primitive building block data structure
In called
The also support associative array
Most program using associative array point need store data permanent form like
A common solution problem generalized concept known produce text binary representation original object written directly file
This commonly implemented underlying object model like Cocoa include standard function convert internal data text form
The program create complete text representation group object calling method almost always already implemented base associative array class
For program use large data set sort individual file storage appropriate DB required
Some DB system natively store associative array serializing data storing serialized data key
Individual array loaded saved database using key refer
These used many year history long common RDBs lack standardization among reason limited use certain niche role
RDBs used role case although saving object RDB complicated problem known
After need high performance database suitable closely matching internal structure program using led renaissance store market
These system store retrieve associative array native fashion greatly improve performance common workflow

Teams reflect identify improvement backlog item via structured workshop
One statement Agile Manifesto summarizes important philosophy continuous improvement SAFe approach At regular interval team reflects become effective tune adjusts behavior SAFe emphasizes importance philosophy taking step including relentless improvement one four pillar SAFe House Lean
While opportunity improve occur continuously applying structure cadence synchronization help ensure also time set aside consider done better inspect adapt
All program stakeholder participate I A workshop
The result set improvement backlog item team add backlog next PI Planning event
In way every improves every PI
For large solution similar I A workshop also occurs
The I A workshop consists three part Participants program I A workshop wherever possible people involved building system
These include Additionally stakeholder may attend workshop
The PI first part I A little different one precede intended show ART developed course PI
Typically audience broader example additional representative may choose attend demo
Therefore PI system demo tends little formal extra preparation staging usually required
But like system demo timeboxed hour le level abstraction high enough keep stakeholder actively engaged providing feedback
During PI system demo Business Owners customer vital stakeholder collaborate Agile team rate actual business value achieved
In second part workshop team review quantitative agreed collect discus data trend
In preparation RTE often responsible gathering information analyzing identify potential issue facilitating presentation finding ART
One primary measurement program predictability measure
Each team planned actual business value rolled program predictability measure shown Figure
Reliable train operate percent range allows business outside stakeholder plan effectively
Note Stretch objective count toward commitment count toward actual score also seen Figure
The team run brief minute le retrospective goal identify whatever issue would like address There one way several different Agile retrospective format used
The objective retrospective identify significant problem team potentially address
Based attendance retrospective nature problem identified facilitator help group decide issue want tackle
Each team choice resolving problem typically selecting problem joining others wish work issue
This help provide differing view problem seed workshop likely impacted best motivated address issue
Key Business Owners customer team retro workshop follow
Often Business Owners alone unblock impediment exist outside team control
For problem structured workshop held ART
Root cause analysis provides set tool used identify actual cause problem rather addressing symptom
The session typically facilitated RTE another facilitator timebox two hour le
Figure illustrates step workshop
The following section describe step process
American inventor Charles Kettering credited statement problem well stated problem half At point team problem want address
But agree problem likely differing perspective
To end team spend minute stating problem thinking impact succinctly

Effective tool include fishbone diagram Also known fishbone diagram visual tool used explore cause specific event source variation process
Figure illustrates fishbone diagram problem statement written head For workshop preload main bone category people process tool program environment
Causes identified grouped category bone main bone
However may adapted appropriate
Team member brainstorm factor think contribute problem solved
Once root cause identified cause identified technique
By simply asking many five time easier discover added diagram
also known rule technique used narrow number action produce significant overall effect
It us principle percent cause responsible percent problem
It especially useful many possible course action competing attention almost always case complex systemic issue
Once possible identified team member cumulatively vote item think significant factor causing end problem
They placing star five star allocated group member spread among one item see fit cause think problematic
The team summarizes vote Pareto chart example Figure illustrates collective consensus significant root cause
The next step pick largest cause list restate clearly problem
This take minute team close root cause
At point root cause start imply potential solution
The working group brainstorm many possible corrective action think within fixed timebox minute
The rule brainstorming apply The team cumulatively vote three likely solution
These serve improvement story feature fed directly session follows
During session RTE help ensure relevant improvement loaded onto plan thus ensuring action taken resource allocated backlog item
This close loop retrospective ensures people resource dedicated necessary improve current state
In way routine systematic program large solution level team member program stakeholder value stream stakeholder assured value stream solidly journey relentless improvement
The describes rigorous approach context single program
It often includes key stakeholder large solution level recommended path facilitate development
In larger value stream however additional large solution level I A workshop may required following format
Due number people attendee large solution I A workshop include everyone stakeholder selected best suited address context

The term refers adapts behaviour individual user based acquired user environment
A pass potentially long cycle delivery realize component system
However impossible anticipate user single best optimal system configuration impossible
The active involvement user clear understanding user requirement challenge interactive system two reason With norm give guidance activity throughout life cycle interactive system
One core task design negotiate facilitate across acknowledging different form expression different requirement side
However despite implementation design process type modern application require instant adaptation due exposure increasing situational dynamic
Even design process implemented project guarantee certain degree yield richer understanding context use completed product ability adapt changing condition still play central role broad acceptance
The operational environment change task distinct competence expectation evolve
Here impossible developer anticipate possible requirement modification
Thus dynamic changing condition shift customisation process system characteristic development phase usage operation phase time needed professional development short new feature costly
For reason developer implement technique adaptation system order react changing condition fast possible
The example application scenario clearly show important distinction concerning adaptation technique differentiation manually automatically performed adaptation process
Accordingly term adaptation decomposes two term adaptivity
Adaptivity indicates system adapts automatically user according changing condition

Adaptability refers user substantially customise system tailoring activity
adaptable system
Adaptive adaptable system complementary
Both method increase match user need system behaviour development system finished
Thus system kept flexible usage
Changing condition trigger execution adaptation
Many characteristic might taken account adaptation process
They clustered three main category environmental difference
Differences address variety among several user along manifold dimension
Physiological characteristic like disability major concern application designer want system accepted large community
The consideration user like scheme interaction option property numberless personal preference popular source adaptation reused different application
Other source user interest disinterest personality characteristic like difficult ass automatically
difference consider development single user well task time
A static system fall short changing user requirement user activity goal evolve
In extreme case user system beginning perceive system cumbersome restricted user increase
In manner need higher computer system pushed changing task accomplished system
Environmental Differences basically result computing device application people lead highly dynamic computing environment
Unlike rely carefully configured largely static set resource application subject change available resource network connectivity device
Moreover frequently required cooperate spontaneously opportunistically previously unknown software service order accomplish task behalf user
Thus environment surrounding application user major source justify adaptation operation

The adapter pattern used client class call incompatible provider class
Let imagine MailingClient class need call method LegacyEmployee class already call class implement interface implement
We could add new method implement interface legacy code ca changed
We could modify class call need change every call
The formatting code would duplicated everywhere
Moreover wo able call provider class implement interface
So solution code formatting code another independent class adapter also called implement interface
call
format data call
This type adapter called
The type adapter
Describe class adapter
The JavaScript library implement adapter pattern
This library used canvas element
The canvas element two interface WebGL
The first one simple use second much complex optimized faster
The WebGL interface interface client call interface
Think twice implementing pattern
This pattern planned design time
If plan use project scratch mean understand pattern
It used legacy code
It least bad solution
Its implementation easy expensive
You refactor code client provider able work together yet
This worst part
Most code redundancy le without pattern
The modern interface always provide much information legacy interface need work
If one information missing modern interface call pattern question
This pattern easily removed automatic refactoring operation easily remove existence
Our company created merger
One list employee available database access via class One list employee available LDAP access via class To access former employee company A former employee company B define interface used two adapter We create adapter code former company A We create adapter code former company B Add illustration

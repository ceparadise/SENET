I chance chose CS however I
Instead I went year architect something I might spend rest life regretting
Just kidding
Tell education architecture greeeeeeaat
The beautiful part like door could lead almost anything
Take research find people used architecture program currently architecture industry amazing stuff
Such Joseph Kosinski director oblivion movie also many designer working medium industry blurring edge design technology mention working designer architectural designer
Take example I work architect I also built drone including scripting flight control system stuff
I would say case I need visa status way I would architect though well architectural design stuff boring day day mention salary half friend EE CS
I recommend research able choose among graduation see still interested
If potential direction attracts architecture definitely way go
Otherwise I guess might wan na rethink majoring architecture
Of course money big deal I would always recommend architectural education
Really personally speaking fantastic
As architect tradition try talk architecture
Also first reaction detail question led think interested architecture
I might wrong
Back I child I debated I become architect pop singer like Cyndi Lauper astronaut
I information currently I chose architect stuck throughout year
I convinced one actually choose career checklist advantage disadvantage
I think drawn intuitively something identify something like I architect I firefighter pride cliche come
Perhaps I passion speak mean existential crisis past year schooling practice
As I wrapping high school people started telling Architecture difficult major lot work
I thought people telling lazy
Although I understand better Architecture reputation strange young person would want avoid hard work
It seems anything interesting hard work least take commitment
I ca speak much Computer Science people drop program
It interesting enough hard work
Here I tell Architecture Good luck decision
Still question
Ask

What opinion getting minor Computer Science BS Architecture
Will benefit
I need fill elective one professor suggested I sure
I computer savvy person might benefit I hate math
I also considered business art history minor taking extra design class like advanced drawing digital graphic furniture design build portfolio grad school
I want go better grad school university I I might want take design class improve portfolio wo impressive future employer like business computer science minor although employer could care le minor
Thanks comment
How focus one thing right instead dicking around bunch contingency option go anywhere
Do
Do let moron like kidrocks get
You good single thing good something even hate
Basically minor Computer Science quarter credit worth shit
You would hired serious employer computer science IT field anything lowest level customer support
Unless plan updating webpage architecture firm
At least without serious experience
Granted aspect computer science software development require advance math skill knowledge
However math something need proficient degree stuff like cryptographic algorithm mathematical based compression algorithm forth
In Architecture field I would reason business minor applicable computer science minor much CS introductory knowledge programming
You need tad proficient programming language good generally know number
Unless put alot supplementary additional course online learning addition CS minor going much value anyone pay would low work
An employer going pay
edit web page
Those task would either done lower pay rate IDP intern payrate would assigned someone paid minimum wage year certificate community college would equate maybe hour minimum wage
A minor le academic year worth credit going much value part
An entry level person year degree worth
entry level year experience
Goes experience
That average nominal payrate around
Anyway bottom line
Since math computer science fringe architecture firm would
If take computer science course take specific course would integrate major like learning scripting part architectural software AutoCAD tool
Do even worry degree
You take specific course without pursuing degree certificate minor even college credit get knowledge skill usable professional career development
null pointer I agree point person need commit minor good useful computer science education
Some case better specific course used profession
Anything le two academic year computer science related education either end Associates degree Bachelors degree worth squat unless supplement job generally go le two year education experience combination education experience
Experience include running business creating software project portfolio work demonstrating knowledge proficiency well sound understanding vocabulary forth
Anything le joke basically drop minimum wage
To add kickrock also good point good point opposite side issue
On one side issue DO WASTE TIME ON IT BECAUSE IT WILL GO NO WHERE
In competitive marketplace lot people thorough education computer science would hired offer serious package value website work manage develop network need develop custom customized software script needed
side issue YOU NEED TO HAVE A DIVERSE EDUCATION BECAUSE ARCHITECTURE IS NOT A FIELD WHERE YOU CAN SOLELY MAKE YOUR WHOLE LIVING FROM
YOU NEED TO DO MORE THAN ARCHITECTURE TO PAY THE BILLS AND HAVE A LIVING
EXCEPT FOR THE EXCEPTIONAL RELATIVELY FEW THAT CAN THE MAJORITY EITHER HAS TO MARRY A WELL TO DO SPOUSE OR THEY HAVE TO ESSENTIALLY WORK MULTIPLE CAREERS
This mean need something else fall
Architecture usually keep busy maybe month year rest year waiting work occassional site visit
You got month client keep cash flow
So hurting
Then boom bust cycle nasty seldom would see two profession hinged thing
Sure everything hinge money money economy computer science example architecture field
When crash happens architecture field necessarily happening computer field time
That exceptional
Therefore possible career computer science addition architecture
It keep afloat
It said skyrocketing education cost really sad state affair America mention already parent working
Now parent household work double essentially
Yes null pointer everyone minor going valuable profession
Is sign bunch useless minor hoping rudimentary education exposure would land somewhere
Doubtful would surprised seeing defensive
Read post
If serious consider taking instead trying cram basic stuff graduating wherever
It take longer backup plan good
There something determination something pad resume
I would support Kickrocks point
In CS minor taking enough course even course two upper division numbered course different course offering community college instructor difference still
We talking science
When get right either know IP address
You know bubble sort
Either
So matter lower upper division
At end day need sufficient body knowledge proficient level usable
The person attain full degree associate bachelor degree master degree pursue
Agree point
Personally I think finish Bachelor especially go grad school possibly could major say MBA MS CS
However CS wo necessarily improve portfolio architecture architecture firm look computer science portfolio work IDP position
Thanks advise
I appreciate
I agree computer science waste time looking big picture
I think I take design class focus major take business class elective
For grad school I plan getting dual MArch Real Estate development MBA
Therefore design class business class build future graduate degree
Would taking basic business class worth common sense
If I get MBA would pointless cover basic business minor plus
However master real estate development basic class like accounting
So maybe minor business build future real estate development master
However taking extra design class improve portfolio get better architecture school get experience design
Any opinion
justiritchey If want develop computer science skill way without degree conferred online
For computer science architecture computer architecture building architecture
Among offering specifically thing like game design
It
You option front
But I recommend seek MArch Development path
If NAAB accredited degree skip unless plan professor
Architects program future architect architectural design becomes increasingly parametric headed Dynamo grasshopper Revit Rhino respectively need good programming skill
I use work someone architecture major Cal Poly SLO switched CS became parametric programming Ninja software us parametric programming called Dream Actually MBA RE cover stuff business minor wo cover minor consists course major
They always
However grad school likely additional assignment work need understand subject deeper
In addition RE development MBA going encompass comprehensive course work context real estate development money
If paid attention discussion length time money architecture field real estate end designing

Plenty people make living architecture worry Balkin hysteria
There problem profession nothing perfect

Take want take
Enjoy least education
Drawing good
Furniture design would great choice definitely something portfolio
You interested preservation right
Maybe history local possible might get research

Grad school basically going judge portfolio
I think care choice minor unless especially interesting
Xenakis There point would need full degree worth get enough familiarity programming write actual program programming language
One usually need get close year programming primary programming language get really good
Aside number supporting scripting language
With experience field way back take time
Programming language like foreign language
To get fluent language syntax take time get spend alot time thinking command
You know heart
It take long learn individual command learning body command use efficiently like learn use construct word fluently
So yes need alot taking minor
Anonitect At point education need fit inline career direction
Usually people go grad school working time
Education career development investment
Invest wisely make use
Thanks input advice
It helpful
Unfortunately current school offer BArch BS Arch I get MArch master RE
For elective I think I focus building portfolio design class maybe RE finance course local history course since I want eventually get graduate certificate historic preservation
My whole objective career buy old property urban area redevelop make sustainable redesign
Then sell rent
I figured best way conserve architecture
I think focusing portfolio good career choice school program suit
Also Udemy free business course like accounting project management business minor would spend money I
Balkins Education strictly vocational
Its also well education
Improving mind trying new thing etc
Sounds like guy already majoring subject want pursue career totally responsible plan grad school
He little fun
The stuff talking good portfolio anyway
Justin Take drawing class
I ca recommend highly enough
Also talking basically flipping landlording would really need
You could spend couple year swinging hammer get experience save cash payment first property
You could lot folk
Market fluctuation might kick as though
And I totally agree good way conserve architecture
Frankly unless trust fund pay living education vocational training preparing people job career requires degree
When rack loan debt size Olympus Mon might good reason blow away money like fucking idiot
Unless take education vocational training kind stuck minimum wage job
When year loan debt career vocational objective shit grin
If fun take personal enrichment class community college institution nominal fee receive zero credit
Otherwise ruin academic future
Taking course two one thing
My point OP taking minor CS qualify shit anything relating computer science CS
You need bit plan use knowledge vocationally minor instruct enough competency
Unless healthy trust fund need work living
Vocation Career basically YOUR LIFE
It feed put roof head working pay food eat place live amenity life free lunch
Work get paid live
You work get paid simply die
math want computer science degree
Otherwise ruin academic future
read Otherwise ruin career
Point spend bunch money credit use vocationally career waste
Universities cost damn much messing around
It career investment would floundering decision need prudent shape knowledge skill foundation get job begin career
Degrees relative shelf life
Some good year essentially unemployable work experience keep knowledge skill relevant obsolete
Why think continuing education
In case experience suffices
But nothing know knowledge skill becomes obsolete time need change knowledge skill needed change competition replaces old obsolete
Education investment one future
Mismanagement ruin
You know I mean anon
Balkins could get past community college
Please shut adult speak
dual null pointer I university year
In computer programming I education experience spanning year
I programming Commodore game application back late well Amiga many computer platform
My experience alone would order doctorate
Back college degree program video game design programming development
I could went computer science I could
I blocked admission direction
I agree toasteroven yes I agree point degree labeled science much logic oriented
Video Game design kind marriage art science application software development programming
Balkins I work living I pretty well I took elective I interested rather trying figure I might possibly impress potential future employer
I racked loan control almost gone fact
Taking impractical class college hurt
In fact made life far interesting would I preoccupied vocational training I got chance figure I really stuff become part working life
When I said fun I suggesting guy skip class play video game
I meant take course sound interesting broaden education
Life work unless drone
Learning think priceless college one place get develop muscle
Taking elective fine
That dispute
Taking minor generally elective bottom line keeping mind long run
In part clarifying point I agree point
No I suggesting taking course strictly directly apply career useful end would apply course career
They indirect though
It would waste take get CS minor use apply learn
If never write computer program getting CS minor would somewhat wasteful find way cultivate knowledge skill learn vocation career course life
I glad found way use stuff
Disciplined Prudent approach selecting course long term career mind
Aimlessly choosing take course waste
I hope clear
I think come agreement general
OP minimum would learn basic code would allow pontificate power scripting parametricism architecture basic CS class would take would probably put light year ahead phony talking shit like know code
really learn chigurh Sure
But basic CS class hold actually write actual computer program commercially sell people would buy
Yes done end day come possessing knowledge skill comparable would learn going college additional experience maybe needed job
When I started way back Ronald Reagan President
Many job requires degree Computer Science related degree comparable equivalent experience demonstrates comparable knowledge skill
I degree programming networking necessarily required computer programming networking
With tool available one learn program use new tool available way could really manner BBSs computer network
However text resource go long way
Then programming day GUIs like today
It different work
Game design involves another tier knowledge game designing including game mechanic story etc
It additional knowledge base
Over year I translate knowledge across different computer language
Over time learn syntax language proficient language
On production side performance factor slow keep job long
This different architect CAD staff
You want CAD technician productive efficient
toasteroven IMO OP take intro CS much critical parametricists Agree
toaster indeed I watched lecture month back one total fraud phony talking using scripting generate project somebody asked question went bullshit description complex numerous parameter extreme computing power required generate project total bullshit
Like running numerical model cloud server create node triangulate resulting mesh total fucking phony
I always think real programmer would look architect pas complicated scripting fucking laugh ass grader logowriter max Yep
parametric scripting segment computer programming
I much applied programming knowledge parametric scripting area programming generally different area programming
Nonetheless I would agree point
Remembering AutoCAD scripting language AutoLISP Visual LISP dialect LISP LOGO derivative subset LISP
In sense modify LOGO language got vector modeling using basically LOGO syntax
I worked LOGO year I see resemblance language
Back
LOGO PILOT interesting stuff long kind limited application use
Download take ride summer see like programming
I likely take flack making suggestion designed occasion like
If like carry get serious language built around
If move
You need understand want get besides money
There lot money lot trap
I know many RE student toiling away manner similar entry level architect looking next site Hilton
Yes get paid better cost education higher hard soft cost
Make sure increased salary become moot point
Finally dual degree may make attractive may make lower quality degree
I saying I saying make plan allows excel
A double degree mediocre grade weak portfolio limit option grad school
The advice I got subject futurist ARUP make friend computer people know trend wide knowledge possibility
To specialize would trouble worth architecture student
Marc Miller Thanks advice
I thinking I might get MArch MRED
I want preservationist I might need architecture license might get dual master RE development historic preservation
In sense developer I still design I say effect built environment
It would difficult architect developer time career requires lot time
To taken seriously historic preservation knowing WTF talking
Bottom Line
Historic Preservation involves multiple professional
Historic preservation field I would say includes Restoration Renovation Rehabilitation Reconstruction R Remodel bad word
Remodel basically Remuddle
It mean desecrating historic character usually
In different area historic preservation craftsman applying knowledge craft wood specialization researching side also research archaeological well environmental geographic perspective architectural history architectural historian etc
design engineering side thing
There alot discipline involved research craft trade side historic preservation
There lot involved also kind service involved
Each person find fit package service need
Those three r essentially boil classification
And true Preservation notably differed history thee significant element material practice embedded reference set
That said also mean must aware period historic significance notable person etc
four R
common
The last one relatively rare
Aside yep
Op determined career Would dual MArch MSHP His Prv MRED MSHP MA Arch His MSHP better career historic preservation
Keep mind I want building conservator designer eventually preservation consultant
I interested redesigning developing old building
Once I thought getting dual major MArch MRED certificate HP however I think would hard developer architect since requires experience
What better preservation architect developer architectural historian
Also I need PHD preservationist
It mentioned I wo taken seriously without PHD
However I want practice preservation activist researcher
The PhD help something trend
A lot preservation program particularly recognized one associated history program
Do
If education NSPE accredited program working professional area education experience proper job good reputation would taken seriously
Not area historic preservation served high level degree
If area hand craft experience craft better doctorate day
I rather experienced craftsman physical restoration book worm know use hammer
When I need restoration work done house I need experience craftsman craft
I need good researcher research
It team approach
They doctoral degree field craft
If area research need good
If area custom millwork window restoration whatever DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO BE GOOD AT IT
It necessarily degree determine whether take seriously
It reputation make know talking
I hope help understand
Computers Science knowledge would bad thing I studied architecture I considering going back school CS Robotics depending I prefer go deeper build environment technology adaptive material digital fabrication
It really depends want get something someone suggested
Are sure want block user hide related comment throughout site

Hi everyone Looking help anyone opinion following matter I accepted architecture program computer science program university two different university actually
Initially I applying architecture profession I saw going applied comp science back
I got I second thought
The computer science program turn cheaper shorter least year shorter I wo move halfway across country school literally ten minute away home
I still fine according budget thousand dollar debt I take architecture route
On hand I feel like I would enjoy architecture computer science
Another aspect prospect graduation look job website ca help notice many job compared architecture
As matter fact I barely saw architecture job posting mostly senior architect graduate architect year experience
How people find job right University mystery yet every graduate program accepted found le related job architecture firm design bureau
I talked couple professional side seems computer professional better balance architect enjoy bit also likely work year road
I know profession entail would mind either feel like I would enjoy architecture would know sure I fully involved process
It three week since I started thinking weighting two together I thought every argument possible exhausted death I need fresh perspective people already industry academia
What would place
I know ultimately going decision nobody decide better I asking point maybe something I thought aspect architecture computer science familiar field
Now clarify second degree going last one I getting unless I decide research either field
So computer science I planning build existing BSc finish two year six term including summer architecture program year long
Please thank
Aside stress bad press lack job graduation etc studying architecture best decision I made life life changing experience
I ca think anything else would enriched changed degree I today
I originally Computer Science program dropped go get BArch instead
I tell I wish I stuck Computer Science
Not I enjoy architecture introduction computer programming architectural modeling parametric modeling I believe CS degree would extremely beneficial
So I would say go CS able add MArch get benefit world
It sound like last degree though I sure suggest
It want life mate
You need think well later may deeply regret choice
Do think much cost happiness price
I putting computer science though magentasky right computer inevitable part architecture

A couple company I connected struggling apply Agile technique system system system enterprise architecture general
Dean Leffingwell work provides guidance point
Leffingwell work flawed reflects issue result misconception architecture discussing system
Technical architect often accused overly focused definition term
While largely true response situation definition clear people talk past one another
The root problem lie one core principle Agile development given Agile Manifesto current version On surface nothing wrong statement thing usually go wrong implementation
The statement implies architecture software system fluid evolves time emerges development development team considerable choice matter architecture
The statement also creates implication architectural work bad avoided
Both implication result misperceptions architecture especially applied system
To understand misperceptions originate one must explore many definition software architecture published last decade
Rozanski Woods Software Systems Architecture provide following definition The folk Software Engineering Institute Len Bass et al provide definition Software Architecture Practice The IEEE standard later adopted definition In PhD dissertation Roy Fielding inventor Representational State Transfer architecture REST currently popular among web service developer provides two definition one static one dynamic Most definition share common pattern They define architecture term structure organization component term component
For reason often lost user definition tend focus set component structure form
For example Barry Boehm Richard Turner quoted describing software architecture part In description focus component rather structure form stark
This view seems pervade Agile literature thinking
The set component manifestation architecture architecture
The component set indeed evolve development progress architecture likely vary much
Technology platform decision map specific product various component decision affect component lie vicinity
This architecture either
When Iasa Board Education first set define curriculum software architecture noted striking similarity difference among various definition
We could create curriculum based set set summarize combine
A quick look definition give insight ensuing debate
Fielding definition led u notion dominant structure central theme architecture
Fielding say software system one architecture may several
He allows one software architecture rest multiple software architecture running
This counterintuitive How structure one architecture time
To address went back favorite analogy Building architecture
No matter else true building one overarching architecture
The specific architecture may debate relation building assumption one architecture defines building
If true must able identify essential characteristic determine overarching architecture
Upon examination find various component building form dominant structure pattern determines overall architecture
Could true system well
Indeed
After serious debate Iasa team created definition The set component system form structure whose pattern lead overarching architecture system whole
This pattern formed well set component final well technology choice made
The pattern usually discovered rather designed tends driven characteristic problem solved
It turn pattern often established first conversation among owner developer address two question So facing start Further pattern established hard change
For example decision made use central data store database set flat file noSQL tool chunk memory basic pattern system defined
A central data store defining feature blackboard pattern
Once anything implemented according pattern changing pattern much difficult matter refactoring
Most application today follow similar pattern layer web server serve HTML layer application server handle application logic layer data server serve data content
While detail within layer vary greatly basic pattern layer usually remains intact
Even specific layer change layer pattern
The name fact describes set layer
Once accept architecture system structure formed component rather actual set component many issue applying Agile technique fall away
What go architectural runway defined Leffingwell becomes clearer well

submitted Hello
I student studying architecture designing building software architecture
I already gotten Bachelors Science Design Architecture I halfway master course
The thing every year I enjoying architecture le le
I thought switching CS end second year convinced stick mom
Now I almost done program I feel like I always bottom class
I design building level detail passion everyone around
When I get critiqued listen lesson I understand language never implement
It I know problem really answer I idea get answer
This caused become depressed every year point struggle get bed go studio every morning
I lay bed hour til I pee back sore I physically ca lay anymore
I talked counselor helped get negativity head I still depressed
I feel like I made wrong choice someone told I study architecture way back middle school stuck til I got point
I feel like poor performance architecture student volatile architecture job market dwindling interest I wo find job next year end moving home never using degree I spent year thousand
My biggest question
Is desire degree CS Architecture thus design
I thinking I could stop working master start working CS degree OSU online program
I always computer guy growing
I love learning new thing computer find fantasizing computer project head architecture project
I took semester high school Cisco certified I sure expired year ago
I also essentially IT guy Sysadmin mom daycare business since opened year ago
I setup computer I installed setup software keep track employee client finance
I done networking I setup basic server I plan expanding summer much
I started enjoying
The challenge fun seems work thought process architecture
I feel drained time I finished architecture project I feel successful
The go working mom
I work computer problem hour trying figure wrong I need get desired come end proud work
In architecture I feel like I I I finish project
From I read online seems like shortage employment opportunity CS opposed job opening architecture
I thinking I could track working local computer repair store even
Sorry long probably bit ranty I trying push one direction
I ca get nagging thought head need push
BSD Architecture student tired designing building looking OSU CS online degree career change something computer
Would someone BSD Architecture BS CS look valuable future employer
Post comment
I believe dual degree ANYTHING CS would allow approach company software market get attention candidate

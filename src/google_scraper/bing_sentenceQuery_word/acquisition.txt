Today computational linguist often work member interdisciplinary team include regular linguist expert target language computer scientist
In general computational linguistics draw upon involvement expert among others
Computational linguistics theoretical applied component
Theoretical computational linguistics focus issue cognitive science applied computational linguistics focus practical outcome modeling human language use
The defines computational linguistics Computational linguistics often grouped within field artificial intelligence actually present development artificial intelligence
Computational linguistics originated effort United States use computer automatically translate text foreign language particularly Russian scientific journal English
Since computer make calculation much faster accurately human thought short matter time could also begin process language
Computational quantitative method also used historically attempted reconstruction earlier form modern language subgrouping modern language language family
Earlier method proven premature inaccurate
However recent interdisciplinary study borrow concept biological study especially proved produce sophisticated analytical tool trustful result
When also known mechanical translation failed yield accurate translation right away automated processing human language recognized far complex originally assumed
Computational linguistics born name new field study devoted developing software intelligently processing language data
The term computational linguistics first coined founding member
When artificial intelligence came existence field computational linguistics became artificial intelligence dealing comprehension production natural language
In order translate one language another observed one understand language including grammar word form grammar sentence structure
In order understand syntax one also understand even something language use
Thus started effort translate language evolved entire discipline devoted understanding represent process natural language using computer
Nowadays research within scope computational linguistics done computational linguistics department computational linguistics laboratory department linguistics department
Some research field computational linguistics aim create working speech text processing system others aim create system allowing interaction
Programs meant communication called
Just computational linguistics performed expert variety field wide assortment department research field broach diverse range topic
The following section discus literature available across entire field broken four main area discourse developmental linguistics structural linguistics linguistic production linguistic comprehension
Language cognitive skill develops throughout life individual
This developmental process examined using number technique computational approach one
Human provide constraint make harder apply computational method understanding
For instance human child largely exposed positive evidence
This mean linguistic development individual evidence correct form provided evidence correct
This insufficient information simple hypothesis testing procedure information complex language provides certain boundary computational approach modeling language development acquisition individual
Attempts made model developmental process language acquisition child computational angle leading
Work realm also proposed method explain history
Using model shown language learned combination simple input presented incrementally child develops better memory longer attention span
This simultaneously posed reason long developmental period human child
Both conclusion drawn strength project created
The ability infant develop language also modeled using robot order test linguistic theory
Enabled learn child might model created based model mapping action perception effect created linked spoken word
Crucially robot able acquire functioning mapping without needing grammatical structure vastly simplifying learning process shedding light information furthers current understanding linguistic development
It important note information could empirically tested using computational approach
As understanding linguistic development individual within lifetime continually improved using neural network learning robotic system also important keep mind language change develop time
Computational approach understanding phenomenon unearthed interesting information
Using dynamic researcher created system predicts future linguistic evolution also give insight evolutionary history language
This modeling effort achieved computational linguistics would otherwise impossible
It clear understanding linguistic development human well throughout evolutionary time fantastically improved advance computational linguistics
The ability model modify system affords science ethical method testing hypothesis would otherwise intractable
In order create better computational model language understanding language structure crucial
To end meticulously studied using computational approach better understand language work structural level
One important piece able study linguistic structure availability large linguistic corpus sample
This grant computational linguist raw data necessary run model gain better understanding underlying structure present vast amount data contained single language
One cited English linguistic corpus Penn
Derived source IBM computer manual transcribed telephone conversation corpus contains million word American English
This corpus primarily annotated using tagging yielded substantial empirical observation related language structure
Theoretical approach structure language also developed
These work allow computational linguistics framework within work hypothesis understanding language myriad way
One original theoretical thesis internalization structure language proposed two type model
In model rule pattern learned increase strength frequency encounter
The work also created question computational linguist answer infant learn specific grammar without learning overgeneralized version getting stuck
Theoretical effort like set direction research go early lifetime field study crucial growth field
Structural information language allows discovery implementation similarity recognition pair text utterance
For instance recently proven based structural information present pattern human discourse conceptual used model visualize trend data create reliable measure similarity natural textual utterance
This technique strong tool probing structure human
Without computational approach question vastly complex information present discourse data would remained inaccessible scientist
Information regarding structural data language available well language
Using computational method Japanese sentence corpus analyzed pattern found relation sentence length
Though exact cause lognormality remains unknown precisely sort intriguing information computational linguistics designed uncover
This information could lead important discovery regarding underlying structure Japanese could number effect understanding Japanese language
Computational linguistics allows exciting addition scientific knowledge base happen quickly little room doubt
Without computational approach structure linguistic data much information available would still hidden vastness data within single language
Computational linguistics allows scientist parse huge amount data reliably efficiently creating possibility discovery unlike seen approach
The production language equally complex information provides necessary skill fluent producer must
That say comprehension half problem communication
The half system produce language computational linguistics made interesting discovery area
In famous paper published proposed possibility machine might one day ability think
As thought experiment might define concept thought machine proposed imitation test human subject two conversation one fellow human another machine attempting respond like human
Turing proposes subject tell difference human machine may concluded machine capable thought
Today test known remains influential idea area artificial intelligence
One earliest best known example computer program designed converse naturally human program developed
The program emulated responding written statement question posed user
It appeared capable understanding said responding intelligently truth simply followed pattern matching routine relied understanding keywords sentence
Its response generated recombining unknown part sentence around properly translated version known word
For example phrase It seems hate ELIZA understands match general pattern word allowing ELIZA update word I replying What make think I hate
In example ELIZA understanding word hate required logical response context type psychotherapy
Some project still trying solve problem first started computational linguistics field first place
However method become refined clever consequently result generated computational linguist become enlightening
In effort improve computer translation several model compared including smoothing technique specific refinement apply verb translation
The model found produce natural translation word refined alignment model dependence fertility model
They also provide efficient training algorithm model presented give scientist ability improve result
This type work specific computational linguistics application could vastly improve understanding language produced comprehended computer
Work also done making computer produce language naturalistic manner
Using linguistic input human algorithm constructed able modify system style production based factor linguistic input human abstract factor like politeness
This work take computational approach via model categorize vast array linguistic style see across individual simplify computer work way making much natural
Many earliest simplest model interaction ELIZA example involve input user generate response computer
By method word typed user trigger computer recognize specific pattern reply accordingly process known
Recent technology placed emphasis interactive system

While impressive kind proven much difficult outside limited scope toy environment
Similarly project developed called designed provide answer naturally written question geological analysis lunar rock returned Apollo mission
These kind problem referred
Initial attempt understanding spoken language based work done signal modeling unknown signal analyzed look pattern make prediction based history
An initial somewhat successful approach applying kind signal modeling language achieved use hidden Markov model detailed Rabiner
This approach attempt determine probability arbitrary number model could used generating speech well modeling probability various word generated possible model
Similar approach employed early attempt starting late IBM using pair probability
More recently kind statistical approach applied difficult task topic identification using Bayesian parameter estimation infer topic probability text document
Modern computational linguistics often combination study computer science programming math particularly statistic language structure natural language processing
Combined field often lead development system recognize speech perform task based speech
Examples include speech recognition software Apple Siri feature spellcheck tool program often used demonstrate pronunciation help disabled machine translation program website Google Translate Word Reference
Computational linguistics especially helpful situation involving
For example filter chatroom website search require computational linguistics
Chat operator often use filter identify certain word phrase deem inappropriate user submit
Another example using filter website
Schools use filter website certain keywords blocked child view
There also many program parent use put content filter place
Computational linguist also develop program group organize content
An example Twitter program group tweet subject keywords
Computational linguistics also used document retrieval clustering
When online search document website retrieved based frequency unique label related typed search engine
For instance search red large vehicle intention finding picture red truck search engine still find information desired matching word car
Computational linguistics divided major area depending upon medium language processed whether spoken textual upon task performed whether analyzing language recognition synthesizing language generation
deal spoken language understood created using computer
Parsing generation computational linguistics dealing respectively taking language apart putting together
Machine translation remains computational linguistics dealing computer translate language
The possibility automatic language translation however yet realized remains notoriously hard branch computational linguistics
Some area research studied computational linguistics include The subject computational linguistics recurring impact popular culture

Computer forensics practice collecting analysing reporting digital data way legally admissible
It used detection prevention crime dispute evidence stored digitally
Computer forensics follows similar process forensic discipline face similar issue
This guide discus computer forensics neutral perspective
It linked particular legislation intended promote particular company product written bias either law enforcement commercial computer forensics
The guide aimed audience provides view computer forensics
Although term computer used concept apply device capable storing digital information
Where methodology mentioned provided example constitute recommendation advice
Copying publishing whole part article licensed solely term There area crime dispute computer forensics applied
Law enforcement agency among earliest heaviest user computer forensics consequently often forefront development field
Computers may constitute scene crime example hacking denial service attack may hold evidence form email internet history document file relevant crime murder kidnap fraud drug trafficking
It content email document file may interest investigator also metadata associated file
A computer forensic examination may reveal document first appeared computer last edited last saved printed user carried action
More recently commercial organisation used computer forensics benefit variety case Intellectual Property theft Industrial espionage Employment dispute Fraud investigation Forgeries Bankruptcy investigation Inappropriate email internet use work place Regulatory compliance For evidence admissible must reliable prejudicial meaning stage computer forensic investigation admissibility forefront examiner mind
A widely used respected set guideline guide investigator area PDF ACPO Guide short
Although ACPO Guide aimed United Kingdom law enforcement main principle applicable computer forensics
The four main principle guide reference law enforcement removed follows
No action change data held computer storage medium may subsequently relied upon court

In circumstance person find necessary access original data held computer storage medium person must competent able give evidence explaining relevance implication action

An audit trail record process applied electronic evidence created preserved
An independent able examine process achieve result

The person charge investigation overall responsibility ensuring law principle adhered
In situation would change suspect computer computer forensic examiner necessary
Traditionally computer forensic examiner would make copy acquire information device turned
A would used make exact bit bit copy original storage medium
The examiner would work copy leaving original demonstrably unchanged
However sometimes possible desirable switch computer
It may possible would example result considerable financial loss owner
The examiner may also wish avoid situation whereby turning device may render valuable evidence permanently lost
In circumstance computer forensic examiner would need carry live acquisition would involve running small program suspect computer order copy acquire data examiner hard drive
By running program attaching destination drive suspect computer examiner make change addition state computer present action
However evidence produced would still usually considered admissible examiner able show action considered necessary recorded action explain court consequence action
We divided computer forensic examination process six stage presented usual chronological order
Forensic readiness important occasionally overlooked stage examination process
In commercial computer forensics include educating client system preparedness example forensic examination provide stronger evidence device auditing feature activated prior incident occurring
For forensic examiner themself readiness include appropriate training regular testing verification software equipment familiarity legislation dealing unexpected issue indecent image child found present commercial job ensuring acquisition data extraction kit complete working order
The evaluation stage includes receiving instruction clarification instruction unclear ambiguous risk analysis allocation role resource
Risk analysis law enforcement may include assessment likelihood physical threat entering suspect property best counter
Commercial organisation also need aware health safety issue conflict interest issue possible risk financial reputation accepting particular project
The main part collection stage acquisition introduced
If acquisition carried rather computer forensic laboratory stage would include identifying securing device may store evidence documenting scene
Interviews meeting personnel may hold information relevant examination could include end user computer manager person responsible providing computer service IT administrator would usually carried stage
The collection stage also involves labelling bagging evidential item site sealed numbered bag
Consideration given securely safely transporting material examiner laboratory
Analysis depends specific job
The examiner usually provides feedback client analysis dialogue analysis may take different path narrowed specific area
Analysis must accurate thorough impartial recorded repeatable completed within available resource allocated
There myriad tool available computer forensics analysis
It opinion examiner use tool feel comfortable long justify choice
The main requirement computer forensic tool meant way examiner sure regularly test calibrate tool rely analysis take place
verification confirm result integrity analysis tool A examiner find artefact X location Y tool B replicate result
This stage usually involves examiner producing structured report finding addressing point initial instruction along subsequent instruction
It would also cover information examiner deems relevant investigation
The report must written end reader mind many case reader terminology used
The examiner also prepared participate meeting telephone conference discus elaborate report
As readiness stage review stage often overlooked disregarded
This may due perceived cost work billable need get next job
However review stage incorporated examination help save money raise level quality making future examination efficient time effective
A review examination simple quick begin stage
It may include basic analysis went wrong went well learning incorporated future examination
Feedback instructing party also sought
Any lesson learnt stage applied next examination fed readiness stage
The issue facing computer forensics examiner broken three broad category technical legal administrative
Encrypted data impossible view without correct key password
Examiners consider key password may stored elsewhere computer another computer suspect access
It could also reside volatile memory computer known RAM usually lost computer another reason consider using live acquisition technique outlined
Storage medium hold ever greater amount data examiner mean analysis computer need sufficient processing power available storage capacity efficiently deal searching analysing large amount data
Computing continually evolving field new hardware software operating system emerging constantly
No single computer forensic examiner expert area though may frequently expected analyse something previously encountered
In order deal situation examiner prepared able test experiment behaviour new technology
Networking sharing knowledge computer forensic examiner useful respect likely someone else already come across issue
practice attempting thwart computer forensic analysis
This may include encryption data make unrecoverable modification file metadata file obfuscation disguising file
As encryption evidence method used may stored elsewhere computer another computer suspect access
In experience rare see tool used correctly frequently enough totally obscure either presence presence evidence used hide
Legal issue may confuse distract computer examiner finding
An example would Trojan Defence
A Trojan piece computer code disguised something benign carry hidden malicious purpose
Trojans many us include uploading downloading file installation virus
A lawyer may able argue action computer carried user automated Trojan without user knowledge Trojan Defence successfully used even trace Trojan malicious code found suspect computer
In case competent opposing lawyer supplied evidence competent computer forensic analyst able dismiss argument
A good examiner identified addressed possible argument opposition carrying analysis writing report
There plethora standard guideline computer forensics appear universally accepted
The reason include body tied particular legislation standard aimed either law enforcement commercial forensics author standard accepted peer high joining fee professional body dissuading practitioner participating
In many jurisdiction qualifying body check competence integrity computer forensics professional
In case anyone may present computer forensic expert may result computer forensic examination questionable quality negative view profession whole

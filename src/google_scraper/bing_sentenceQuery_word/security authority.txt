Questions

Computer Science
A degree meant give deeper scientific foundation would easily get elsewhere
More degree tempting seemingly provide hand approach cost
If interested practice security easily find information online motivation
However studying system security protocol work without appropriate mathematical concept number theory complexity theory probability likely learn course obtaining CS degree going order magnitude harder
You get computer security work number different angle
What interest
Do see security audit business government office finding software vulnerability monitoring system network vulnerability breach working computer forensics fill blank something else
Are interested prevention detection remediation computer crime
Would rather work security related data privacy issue financial fraud etc
security related physical infrastructure security door access securing access industrial machine etc
Essentially computer science teach computing device work
Security breach happen someone something made system work unintended way using number exploit vulnerability misconfigurations software bug manufacturing defect condition exceed design spec social engineering etc
I would suggest start cybersecurity education learning thoroughly system intended work hardware software involved power cord plugged wall funny cat picture monitor begin understand system made work undesirable unexpected way
I say rather vague sort way
physical device desktop laptop mobile device printer router wireless AP IoT gadget etc
constitutes also workflow authentication permission data device access activity information device handling
Outside formal education also keep abreast news
For example business credit card data password stolen happen
Were contributing factor negligence poor security practice ineptitude complacence
Was unknown exploit
How breach discovered
What remediation step taken
What response
What response law enforcement court
Accumulating pile case study like serf couple purpose help develop appreciation boundless creativity ingenuity opportunism cybercriminals give arsenal story tell need convince take computer network security seriously
Lastly foster curiosity
This number one trait need security professional
The best security people I know never stop asking happens wonder work They get tired spelunking log file jiggling doorknob see door server closet locked scanning network looking unexpected device open port
answer question figure area computing interest learn right learn done wrong
Then make career preventing wrong thing done detecting wrong thing done remediating wrong thing
Computer science
The fact matter academia typically interested security security reflects real world nefarious thing happen cyber security taken seriously
And first glance security annoying worry building software solution naturally conflict design
Not much decade ago security afterthought designing building software
Companies would release software fact software revealed nasty security vulnerability would react
Nowadays something everyone comp sci supposed know factor day one building something new
I add good cyber security mean going lot opportunity job
Hackers going away continue innovate way destabilize computer system
That mean forever learning enhancing skill set
Still question

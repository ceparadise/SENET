Want watch later
An essential step ensure project success create project plan project schedule starting execution
Imagine working project manager Love Music leading music record producer
You currently planning release new music album rising pop star Katie
prescribes reliable project schedule allow project manager keep eye project progress compare original plan
This allow realistic understanding project performance ability release album agreed release date
In earned value measured proportionally separate activity
The effort complete separate activity budgeted either part project budget separately case separate team providing support many project
When using earned value management value determined measuring progress related activity
Earned value management defined three activity discrete effort apportioned effort level effort activity
We next discus apportioned effort activity
activity directly linked creation project product measured specific WBS output
Instead directly involved delivery product apportioned effort activity support performance activity
For example noise reduction apportioned effort activity linked discrete effort activity recording voice
As voice recorded noise reduction carried song even though additional element added album
While project activity create physical project output nevertheless crucial account include project schedule
Allocating additional day noise reduction activity impact size album contribute overall quality satisfaction customer
The total time require calculated proportion related discrete activity
The voice recording take one day per song total day album song
The noise reduction take recording time one day whole album
If album recorded day estimated noise reduction performed well taking half day
Get FREE access day create account
Before set release date together Katie need overview activity need carried
A traditional way project management create hierarchical planning structure split whole project work package recording editing cover
Each work package split smaller activity
Recording work package split recording voice melody rhythm
Once project activity identified able estimate duration
However activity estimated way duration activity produce physical output determine duration activity example number song album affect long recording voice take activity quality control noise reduction produce new physical output
The planning process begin creating split final project product work package work package smaller activity
It important create project schedule later track project performance plan using
There three different activity type discrete effort apportioned effort level effort activity
activity linked specific WBS output linked discrete activity instead
The duration progress apportioned effort activity calculated proportion related discrete effort activity

Want watch later
It first day working general contractor first client walk door huge project
He want reform house becomes mansion dream want get estimate cost timeline take build home
After shock massive project set start come plan project
The planning project begin creating work breakdown structure WBS help identify project deliverable work package need completed produce deliverable
Among work package identified building interior decoration landscape
Each work package broken smaller activity
Among activity identified part building work package constructing new wall laying wood flooring electrical work
Once WBS created identified activity used create project budget project schedule
Accurate estimating crucial creating reliable budget schedule later used monitoring project progress tracking earned value
However activity project therefore different estimating technique used different activity
Earned value management distinguishes various activity type
In lesson review difference discrete effort apportioned effort activity
activity linked specific WBS output
The effort required complete activity planned monitored proportionally delivered product
When using earned value management value earned demonstrating progress delivering output
An example discrete effort activity building project laying wood flooring time activity require directly proportional area floor
In case laying flooring whole house expected take working day working day flooring expected ready
Contrary discrete effort activity activity linked specific WBS output
The main aim activity support discrete effort activity
Therefore effort required complete apportioned effort activity allocated proportionally related discrete effort activity
When using earned value management value earned demonstrating progress related discrete effort activity
Get FREE access day create account
An example apportioned activity related laying flooring new project final inspection work done
While physical output created result inspection still want allocate time activity make sure work carried high standard invite client take look new floor
The total time activity require calculated proportion related discrete effort activity
If inspection expected take laying time laying flooring expected take working day inspection estimated take working day
If flooring laid day worth work expected inspection completed well half day worth work
A work breakdown structure WBS help identify project deliverable
The lowest level work breakdown structure activity deliverable broken work package work package broken different activity
activity linked specific WBS output
The effort required complete activity planned controlled monitoring proportion output delivered
The value earned demonstrating progress related discrete effort activity
activity linked specific WBS output
The main aim apportioned effort activity support discrete effort activity

minute read Discrete Effort Apportioned Effort Level Effort LOE type activity used Earned Value Management EVM measure work performance
This area well understood explained project management reference
The purpose post distill information need know topic PMP CAPM exam present simplified manner
Let start PMBOK Guide Edition definition term
An activity planned measured yield specific output
An activity effort allotted proportionately across certain discrete effort divisible discrete effort
An activity produce definitive end product measured passage time
Personally I find definition confusing
First name term contains effort definition say activity
Second elaboration example provided
So effort activity
It type activity
Now cleared let look simplified version term example
Discrete Effort work directly associated Work Breakdown Structure WBS component tangible product service
It directly measured hence also known
Discrete Effort effort build piece software design building create product manual deliverable report
Apportioned Effort work directly associated WBS component project deliverable
The term apportion mean divide share
Apportioned Effort direct supportive relationship Discrete Effort value apportioned effort proportional certain percentage discrete effort support
Apportioned Effort include quality assurance inspection activity
Apportion mean divide share
Level Effort project activity produce tangible outcome measured objectively
LOE include project management management seller customer liaison project cost accounting maintenance equipment administrative work support project
I think Level Effort Level Effort
spread work
This help better relate true meaning LOE
Level Effort spread work
Let say activity develop software program Discrete Effort project Planned Value PV
This software program quality assurance function associated
In case project manager decides allocate PV Discrete Effort develop software program quality assurance activity
As see effort estimate quality assurance effort proportional effort estimate base activity Discrete Effort
If estimate software development activity increased decreased would quality assurance activity proportion
LOE activity consume project resource included EVM planning measurement
LOE based passage time
Planned Value PV automatically credited Earned Value EV end measurement period
Let understand example
Say allocated PV project management work period
At end month EV project management work LOE equal PV

In word Schedule Variance SV always zero Schedule Performance Index SPI always LOE activity
However LOE activity Cost Variance CV provide indication project cost performance
Discrete Effort Apportioned Effort measured physical progress complete whereas LOE measured duration
Yes
As example project management work usually included WBS
No
An LOE activity never critical path project schedule never add time project
LOE SS SF relationship base activity discrete activity
Due LOE appears hanging beginning end base activity hammock activity
This illustrated well following tutorial video

Hi Nice
I Loved blog I Working PMP Faculty Proventures India
I recommend blog People learning PMP Course
Thanks excellent explanation concept
You welcome Kevin
Glad found useful
Great Elaboration
PMBOKs description way much confusing
Thank Bilal
Great explanation along embedded video
Thank Uday
great article well video see video
great Thank Manchun
Awesome explanation
Thank Merakai
So much elaborated thanks much
The PMBOK version quite confusing
Thanks Ankur really encouraged see positive feedback article
Very nice explanation Thank A muthukumar India Thanks Muthukumar
thanks lot great illustration description Harwinder
sound like direct indirect cost discrete effort directly related production end result design manufacturing etc
LOE apportioned like indirect cost Yes ramyas You right
Thanks comment
Great explanation
Cleared confusion
thanks

SELECT A PAPER APPORTIONED EFFORT Apportioned Effort AE Apportioned Effort AE Task Plans symbolistic relationship two closely related organizational element
You use Earned Value Technique EVT task plan contain work package related work scope cause effect type relationship
The related work package within task plan must work scope dependency
The task plan sequential supportive implied schedule interdependency
The task plan implied Scheduled Work SW interdependency
The implied relationship normally stated set percentage
Figure A The Apportioned Effort Task Plan illustrates application theory Apportioned Effort EVT
Graphic Example see The Task Plans linked using Apportion Effort EVT essentially master task plan slave task plan
If known time delay work scheduled master task plan work scheduled slave task plan time delay factor built plan
As example use AE technique Quality Control QC cost account
WIP inspection task relating directly fabrication cost account
Another example type EVT could model shop making widget
The widget need formally inspected
The WIP inspection task happens model shop produce widget
Historical record indicates WIP inspection task widget ten percent model shop based labor effort
Therefore WIP
inspection labor task related percentage basis preceding model shop labor task Apportioned Effort
Another example might occur software design
For verification certainty Project Office designates software test must performed department department within software design engineer resides
The software test Task Manager apportions testing support effort effort progress toward complete operating module
Keep mind planning stage master cost account begin late apportioned slave cost account begin late
However may follow master account begin early apportioned slave account begin early
Figure B Apportioned Effort Task Plan Scheduled Work SW illustrates work scope planning relationship Apportioned Effort EVT
Graphic Example see Performed P always earned manner planned
When Apportioned Effort method used Performed P direct result performance taken master Task Plan
The Task Plans linked using Apportion Effort EVT master task plan slave task plan
When work performed master task plan assumed apportioned methodology work performed slave task plan
In word wherever dog go tail follow
If work performed within master task plan begin late work performed within apportioned task plan begin late
However may follow master task plan begin early apportioned task plan begin early
The schedule delay therefore masked slave task plan linked directly master task plan Performed P occurs master definition occur slave
The Task Manager responsible slave task plan need reminded established relationship master task plan slave task plan baseline period may produce variance actual performance work scope Task Manager control
The slave task plan variance normally direct result failure perform plan set forth within master task plan
This lack control taken ride Master Task Manager diminish variance reporting responsibility Slave Task Manager

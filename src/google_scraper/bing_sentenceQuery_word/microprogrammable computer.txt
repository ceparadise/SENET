A short macroinstruction rule specifies certain input sequence often sequence mapped replacement output sequence also often sequence character according defined procedure
The mapping process instantiates transforms macro use specific sequence known
A facility writing macro may provided part part
In former case macro used make task using application le repetitive
In latter case tool allows programmer enable even design
Macros used make sequence computing instruction available single program statement making programming task le tedious le
Thus called macro big block code expanded small sequence character
Macros often allow positional keyword parameter dictate program generates used create entire program suite according variable factor
The term derives expansion originally used generating code
allow short sequence keystroke mouse action transform usually sequence keystroke mouse action
In way frequently used repetitive sequence keystroke mouse movement
Separate program creating macro called
During macro program originally SuperKey KeyWorks Prokey popular first mean automatically format variety user input task
These program based TSR mode operation applied keyboard input matter context occurred
They extent fallen obsolescence following advent user interface availability keyboard mouse macro application making possible create keyboard macro
Keyboard macro recent time come life method exploiting economy MMORPGs
By tirelessly performing boring repetitive low risk action player running macro earn large amount game currency resource
This effect even larger player operates multiple account simultaneously operates account large amount time day
As money generated without human intervention dramatically upset economy game
For reason use macro violation MMORPGs administrator MMORPGs fight continual war identify punish macro user
Keyboard mouse macro created using application macro feature sometimes called
They created carrying sequence letting application record action
An underlying macro programming language commonly direct access feature application may also exist
The programmer text editor short editing macro follows idea conclusion
In effect editor made macro
Emacs originally devised set macro editing language later ported dialect
Another programmer text editor descendant also full implementation macro
It record register macro person type keyboard replayed edited like macro Microsoft Office
Vim also scripting language called create macro
VBA programming language included Office
However function evolved replaced macro language originally included application
access executes document opened
This make relatively easy write VBA commonly known
In became one common type computer virus
However late date patching updating program
In addition current program immediately counteract attack
Languages rudimentary macro system implemented compiler assembler
macro work simple textual token rather character level
A classic use macro computer typesetting system derivative functionality based macro
experimental system seek reconcile macro system
typed syntax macro one productive way think syntax macro
Other example Some language embedded text source code language
The mechanism code fragment recognised instance bracketed similar textual macro language much powerful fully featured language
Macros language written subset compiler executes statement compilation time output execution form part code compiled
The ability use familiar macro language give power much greater text substitution macro expense larger slower compiler
frame macro command syntax also contain text language
Each frame generic component hierarchy nested subassemblies procedure integrating subassembly frame recursive process resolve integration conflict favor higher level subassemblies
The output custom document typically compilable source module
Frame technology avoid proliferation similar subtly different component issue plagued software development since invention macro subroutine
Most assembly language le powerful procedural macro facility example allowing block code repeated N time completely different syntax actual assembly language
Macro C preprocessor described work level lexical token preserve lexical structure reliably
Syntactic macro system work instead level preserve lexical structure original program
The widely used implementation syntactic macro system found language
These language especially suited style macro due uniform parenthesized syntax known
In particular uniform syntax make easier determine invocation macro
Lisp macro transform program structure full language available express transformation
While syntactic macro often found language also available language
They also available extension

Before Lisp macro operator whose input value computed argument rather syntactic form argument whose output value used computation
In word FEXPRs implemented level EVAL provided window layer
This generally found difficult model reason effectively
In Timothy Hart proposed adding macro Lisp AI Memo MACRO Definitions LISP
In number paper introduced notion expansion system syntactic environment macro definition macro use distinct allowing macro definers user worry inadvertent variable capture cf

Hygienic macro standardized Scheme standard
The upcoming standard also include hygienic macro
A number competing implementation hygienic macro exist explicit renaming syntactic closure
Both standardized Scheme standard
Recently combined notion hygienic macro syntactic expansion time one macro system ordinary runtime another block code showed apply interleaved expansion parsing language
A number language Scheme either implement hygienic macro implement partially hygienic system
Examples include
conjecture three category make primary legitimate us macro system
Others proposed alternative us macro macro system unhygienic allow selective unhygienic transformation
The interaction macro language feature productive area research
For example useful programming interaction macro construct must defined use together
Module interact macro proposed Scheme language macro
For example language extends notion macro system syntactic tower macro written language including macro using hygiene ensure syntactic layer distinct allowing module export macro module
Macros normally used map short string macro invocation longer sequence instruction
Another le common use macro reverse map sequence instruction macro string
This approach taken Mobile Programming System used rudimentary macro compiler called SIMCMP map specific instruction set given computer counterpart macro
Applications notably compiler written macro run without change computer equipped rudimentary macro compiler
The first application run context sophisticated powerful macro compiler written macro language
This macro compiler applied fashion produce compiled much efficient version
The advantage approach complex application ported one computer different computer little effort target machine architecture writing rudimentary macro compiler
The advent modern programming language notably compiler available virtually computer rendered approach superfluous

Crucially playing game created writing computer code
For Eben Upton smiling man midst throng thoroughly satisfying conclusion long year thinking planning
We working Pi six year never tested child target market say
In event I could asked better could wait try
Now ambition provide every child Britain cheap programmable computer seems close realisation
But fuss
After Pi revolutionary design
It small green circuit board size credit card
It processor similar one used many smartphones particularly fast modern PC standard
It memory chip Ethernet port connect internet couple USB port plug keyboard mouse
And
You need supply keyboard mouse screen
However truly revolutionary thing price
You able order one excluding VAT although demand high anticipated likely end long waiting list
Costs kept according Mr Upton lot goodwill toward project
The software free chip manufacturer kept price low member charitable Raspberry Pi Foundation given time case substantial amount money free
The vast majority profit ploughed back device improvement incentive get child programming
For many child affordable
Peter Boughton say want write computer game grows say That eight week pocket money calculates
I definitely going get one
Other PCs available Raspberry Pi
The difference Pi today licensing deal two firm appears solved problem price scale realising foundation ambition providing unit anyone need one
The first thousand release today funded largely pocket Mr Upton five fellow foundation scientist
Now receive royalty every Pi sold able focus main concern improving widely seen woeful state Britain computer science curriculum
That underlined last summer Google chairman Eric Schmidt said UK country invented computer throwing away great computer heritage failing teach programming school
I flabbergasted learn today computer science even taught standard UK school said
Your IT curriculum focus teaching use software give insight made
Mr Upton belief Pi could provide part solution We want get kid programming
The goal increase number child apply university computer science increase range thing know arrive
At Chesterton Community College Mr Schmidt criticism might seen unfair ICT head Paul Williams typical example information communication technology teacher
Unlike many colleague field know code living
He also run popular programming club school
But even admits current ICT school curriculum mean lesson time spent learning use software rather teaching pupil write code make software work
He estimate tiny fraction student teach go study computer science higher level
His hunch backed research carried Royal Society last month pinpointed decline number British student achieving computing since
And Pi much academic project member Cambridge University academic noted marked reduction number student applying read computer science
But matter
The consensus much Google Mr Schmidt put If UK creative business want thrive digital future need people understand facet integrated beginning

He say We theory back computer people home programmable
The Pi fierce competition computer People would buy computer like ZX BBC Micro play game word processing would find beguiled programming
That gone away game console desktop PCs hide programmability behind quite large layer sophistication
His theory backed Emily Fulcher us mum laptop would dream opening using code case I broke something
For million young coder modern computer mysterious device expensive proprietary software sometimes fraught problem
Children like Emily terrified use family computer anything function costly consumer device
A Raspberry Pi hand different prospect It cheap would worried different thing
And broke could buy another one say Emily
The Pi launch propitious time Britain budding computer scientist
Last month Education Secretary Michael Gove announced tearing current ICT curriculum described demotivating dull
He replacing flexible curriculum computer science programming designed help university industry
Mr Gove even Pi predicting scheme would give child opportunity learn fundamental programming credit computer
Mr Williams wait It Pi going bring affordable device student look developing something
They device hold feel look
I imagine saying Let see get work
How work
How I get
It brilliant
It really get thinking stuff
But Pi doubter like technology journalist Simon Rockman recently wrote Today kid interested coding
The world moved make application work inside black box interesting washing machine vacuum cleaner
I long thought bubble tech people age techie child
Mr Upton remains unfazed
Now Pi launched colleague already looking new way incentivise child coding
There plan offer significant prize perhaps totalling child impress foundation original programming
And foundation already talking exam board educational publisher incorporating Pi lesson plan
Mr Upton convinced Pi prove fun
He say This getting kid engage creatively computer interesting thing
And fair even programming art design using computer creative way

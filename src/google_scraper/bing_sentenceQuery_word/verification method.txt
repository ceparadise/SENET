Formal verification helpful proving correctness system internal memory software expressed source code
The verification system done providing abstract system correspondence mathematical model nature system otherwise known construction
Examples mathematical object often used model system formal semantics programming language
One approach formation consists systematically exhaustive exploration mathematical model possible also infinite model infinite set state effectively represented finitely using abstraction taking advantage symmetry
Usually consists exploring state transition model using smart abstraction technique consider whole group state single operation reduce computing time
Implementation technique include symbolic state space enumeration
The property verified often described LTL PSL Assertions SVA CTL
The great advantage model checking often fully automatic primary disadvantage general scale large system symbolic model typically limited hundred bit state explicit state enumeration requires state space explored relatively small
Another approach deductive verification
It consists generating system specification possibly annotation collection mathematical truth imply conformance system specification discharging obligation using either interactive theorem provers automatic theorem provers SMT solver
This approach disadvantage typically requires user understand detail system work correctly convey information verification system either form sequence theorem proved form specification system component

In order raise reliability system analysis system analysis technique required precision based mathematical proof thus rely upon utilizes computer bookkeeping able handle complex system without worry
Formal verification method primarily based theoretical computer science fundamental like logic calculus automaton theory strongly type system fulfill requirement
The main principle behind formal analysis system construct computer based mathematical model given system formally verify within computer model meet rigorous specification intended behavior

This may appropriate system involving
may used undertake fully formal proof
This expensive practically worthwhile cost mistake extremely high critical part microprocessor design
Further information expanded
As style formal method may roughly classified follows Some practitioner believe formal method community overemphasized full formalization specification design
They contend expressiveness language involved well complexity system modelled make full formalization difficult expensive task
As alternative various formal method emphasize partial specification focused application proposed
Examples lightweight approach formal method include object modelling notation Denney synthesis aspect driven development CSK Tools
Formal method applied various point
Formal method may used give description system developed whatever level detail desired

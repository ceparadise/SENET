The technique employed qualitative analysis vary complexity depending nature sample
In case necessary verify presence certain element group specific test applicable directly sample flame test spot test may available
More often sample complex mixture systematic analysis must made order may identified
It customary classify method two class qualitative inorganic analysis qualitative organic analysis
The classical procedure complete systematic analysis inorganic sample consists several part
First preliminary dry test may performed may consist heating sample detect presence constituent carbon marked appearance smoke char water marked appearance moisture introducing sample flame noting colour produced
Certain element may identified mean characteristic flame colour
After preliminary test performed sample commonly dissolved water later determination anionic constituent negatively charged element grouping element constituent positively charged element grouping element
The procedure followed based principle treating solution succession reagent reagent separate group constituent
The group treated successively reagent divide large group subgroup separate constituent singly
When separated examined confirm presence establish amount present quantitative analysis

The organic nature generally indicated behaviour heated air solid usually melt burn either smoky nonsmoky flame instance leaving black residue carbon
The element usually present carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur occasionally phosphorus halogen metal
Specific test available individual element
analytical chemistry called qualitative analysis
Measurement actual amount certain substance compound mixture termed quantitative analysis
Quantitative analytic measurement determined instance iron make percent mass magnetite mineral commonly seen black sand analyte
Classical qualitative analysis performed adding one series chemical reagent analyte
By observing chemical reaction product one deduce identity analyte
The added reagent chosen selectively reduced qualitative analysis

While data analysis qualitative research include statistical procedure many time analysis becomes ongoing iterative process data continuously collected analyzed almost simultaneously
Indeed researcher generally analyze pattern observation entire data collection phase Savenye Robinson
The form analysis determined specific qualitative approach taken field study ethnography content analysis oral history biography research form data field note document audiotape videotape
An essential component ensuring data integrity accurate appropriate analysis research finding
Improper statistical analysis distort scientific finding mislead casual reader Shepard may negatively influence public perception research
Integrity issue relevant analysis data well
There number issue researcher cognizant respect data analysis
These include A tacit assumption investigator received training sufficient demonstrate high standard research practice
Unintentional scientific misconduct likely result poor instruction
A number study suggest may case often believed Nowak Silverman Manson
For example Sica found adequate training physician medical school proper design implementation evaluation clinical trial abysmally small Sica cited Nowak
Indeed single course biostatistics usually offered Christopher Williams cited Nowak
A common practice investigator defer selection analytic procedure research team statistician
Ideally investigator substantially basic understanding rationale selecting one method analysis another
This allow investigator better supervise staff conduct data analysis process make informed decision While method analysis may differ scientific discipline optimal stage determining appropriate analytic procedure occurs early research process afterthought
According Smeeton Goda Statistical advice obtained stage initial planning investigation example method sampling design questionnaire appropriate
The chief aim analysis distinguish event occurring either reflecting true effect versus false one
Any bias occurring collection data selection method analysis increase likelihood drawing biased inference
Bias occur recruitment study participant fall minimum number required demonstrate statistical power failure maintain sufficient period needed demonstrate effect Altman
When failing demonstrate statistically different level treatment group investigator may resort breaking analysis smaller smaller subgroup order find difference
Although practice may inherently unethical analysis proposed beginning study even intent exploratory nature
If study exploratory nature investigator make explicit reader understand research hunting expedition rather primarily theory driven
Although researcher may hypothesis testing relationship previously untested variable theory developed explain unanticipated finding
Indeed exploratory science priori hypothesis therefore hypothetical test
Although theory often drive process used investigation qualitative study many time pattern behavior occurrence derived analyzed data result developing new theoretical framework rather determined Savenye Robinson
It conceivable multiple statistical test could yield significant finding chance alone rather reflecting true effect
Integrity compromised investigator report test significant finding neglect mention large number test failing reach significance
While access statistical package facilitate application increasingly complex analytic procedure inappropriate us package result abuse well
Every field study developed accepted practice data analysis
Resnik state prudent investigator follow accepted norm
Resnik state norm two factor nature variable used quantitative comparative qualitative assumption population data drawn random distribution independence sample size etc
If one us unconventional norm crucial clearly state done show new possibly unaccepted method analysis used well differs traditional method
For example Schroder Carey Vanable juxtapose identification new powerful data analytic solution developed count data area HIV contraction risk discussion limitation commonly applied method
If one us unconventional norm crucial clearly state done show new possibly unaccepted method analysis used well differs traditional method
For example Schroder Carey Vanable juxtapose identification new powerful data analytic solution developed count data area HIV contraction risk discussion limitation commonly applied method
While conventional practice establish standard acceptability statistical significance certain discipline may also appropriate discus whether attaining statistical significance true practical meaning
Jeans defines clinical significance potential research finding make real important difference client clinical practice health status problem identified relevant priority discipline
Kendall Grove define clinical significance term happens troubled disordered client treatment distinguishable meaningful representative reference group
Thompson Noferi suggest reader counseling literature expect author report either practical clinical significance index within research report
Shepard question author fail point magnitude observed change may small clinical practical significance sometimes supposed change may described detail investigator fails disclose trend statistically significant
No amount statistical analysis regardless level sophistication correct poorly defined objective outcome measurement
Whether done unintentionally design practice increase likelihood clouding interpretation finding thus potentially misleading reader
The basis issue urgency reducing likelihood statistical error
Common challenge include exclusion filling missing data altering otherwise changing data data mining developing graphical representation data Shamoo Resnik
At time investigator may enhance impression significant finding determining present opposed data raw form portion data shown Shamoo Resnik
Nowak note even expert agree distinguishing analyzing massaging data
Shamoo recommends investigator maintain sufficient accurate paper trail data manipulated future review
The integrity data analysis compromised environment context data collected face interview focused group
The occurring within dyadic relationship differs group dynamic occurring within focus group number participant react response
Since data collection process could influenced researcher take account conducting data analysis
Analyses could also influenced method data recorded
For example research event could documented recording audio video transcribing later either researcher survey either preparing ethnographic field note requesting participant take note compile submit researcher
While methodology employed rationale advantage issue objectivity subjectivity may raised data analyzed
During content analysis staff researcher raters may use inconsistent strategy analyzing text material
Some raters may analyze comment whole others may prefer dissect text material separating word phrase clause sentence group sentence
Every effort made reduce eliminate inconsistency raters data integrity compromised
A major challenge data integrity could occur unmonitored supervision inductive technique
Content analysis requires raters assign topic text material comment
The threat integrity may arise raters received inconsistent training may received previous training experience
Previous experience may affect raters perceive material even perceive nature analysis conducted
Thus one rater could assign topic code material significantly different another rater
Strategies address would include clearly stating list analysis procedure protocol manual consistent training routine monitoring raters
Researchers performing analysis either quantitative qualitative analysis aware challenge reliability validity
For example area content analysis Gottschalk identifies three factor affect reliability analyzed data The potential compromising data integrity arises researcher consistently demonstrate stability reproducibility accuracy data analysis According Gottschalk validity content analysis study refers correspondence category classification raters assigned text content conclusion generalizability result theory category support study conclusion finding adequately robust support applied selected theoretical rationale
Upon coding text material content analysis raters must classify code appropriate category matrix
Relying computer software determine frequency word count lead inaccuracy
One may obtain accurate count word occurrence frequency accurate accounting meaning inherent particular usage Gottschalk
Further analysis might appropriate discover dimensionality data set identity new meaningful underlying variable
Whether statistical method analysis used researcher aware potential compromising data integrity
While statistical analysis typically performed quantitative data numerous analytic procedure specifically designed qualitative material including content thematic ethnographic analysis
Regardless whether one study quantitative qualitative phenomenon researcher use variety tool analyze data order test hypothesis discern pattern behavior ultimately answer research question
Failure understand acknowledge data analysis issue presented compromise data integrity

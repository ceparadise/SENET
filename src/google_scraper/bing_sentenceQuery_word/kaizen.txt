Let meet Ms
Leaf owns Leaf Tea Company
She investigating way improve quality product make business profitable
She recently read two method Six Sigma Kaizen wondered might able help business
Let see provide Ms
Leaf information method
methodology whose goal reduce number defect per million opportunity defect anything meet customer expectation
Companies use Six Sigma methodology new product existing product
Six Sigma consists two method DMAIC DMADV
Companies use DMAIC method existing product meet customer expectation need small improvement use DMADV method new product
Companies use existing product meet customer expectation
The DMAIC process consists five step For example Ms
Leaf could use method identify correct problem signature tea customer finding bitter
Using DMAIC method Ms
Leaf project team would first define customer requirement outline problem
They would also define project plan outline resource needed complete project
In measurement phase project team would gather necessary data determine size problem
Once gathered project team analyze data collected determine cause problem
For example particular type tea leaf causing bitterness
In improve phase Ms
Leaf team formulate potential solution problem implemented monitored control phase
Companies use method developing new product
The DMADV process also consists five step Ms
Leaf could follow DMADV method Six Sigma developing new tea infuser mug
In define phase Ms
Leaf project team would define goal project product developed
The measurement phase would require project team determine customer need
In analyze phase option would satisfy customer expectation developed
In design phase Ms
Leaf project team would decide approach design process meet customer expectation
Finally verify phase would allow Ms
Leaf project team confirm product meet need customer
Six Sigma focus quality cost associated poor quality
It also involves reviewing number business process
As result completing Six Sigma review take significant amount time involve project team many different department organization
focus ongoing optimization product service eliminating waste company business process
Besides improving productivity Kaizen also aim improve workplace eliminate work difficult train employee identify take step get rid waste business process
Every area department company including production line use Kaizen improve business process eliminate waste
Unlike Six Sigma project significant change made Kaizen method yield small improvement focus continuous improvement company employee
The Kaizen method seven phase Unlike Six Sigma involves project team specialist employee participate Kaizen initiative
In order company must ensure train employee Kaizen participate
The company put together group evaluate Kaizen submission decide one implement

An example Ms
Leaf could change process documenting quality control issue
Let assume right Ms
Leaf employee identify quality control issue complete detailed form form stapled plastic bag contains product
Ms
Leaf employee noted occasion form becomes detached product making impossible determine problem go product
Ms
Leaf employee identified better solution would place product description sealed bag together ensure separated
This change would ensure employee could investigate quality control issue timely manner
This small change process improves quality control process
method reduce number defect per million opportunity defect anything meet customer expectation
The two Six Sigma DMAIC DMADV
Companies use method existing product meet customer expectation specification
It consists five step define measure analyze improve control
Companies use method Six Sigma new product developed
It consists five step define measure analyze design verify
Six Sigma project team specially trained employee different area company come together complete Six Sigma process quite lengthy
The method focus eliminating waste business process

What Kaizen available

Thanks interest Kaizen continuous improvement
An increasing number healthcare organization embracing approach way improving quality safety patient staff improving patient experience reducing cost
Excerpted The word Kaizen translated Japanese number way simply change Breaking word character shown left A Kaizen small improvement made work
It small improvement easily implemented
Kaizen ongoing methodology philosophy challenging empowering everyone organization use creative idea improve daily work
The word Kaizen way typically used synonymous phrase continuous An effective Kaizen approach making improvement connected measurable result deeper purpose
Children Medical Center Dallas Texas process improvement campaign asks simple question Is better way Clay York manager core laboratory leader help tie department local improvement effort organization mission purpose asking team member proposed change help provide better care Beyond measurable result Kaizen organization value personal organizational learning result improvement process well personal pride satisfaction involved

It word
It might seem little difficult pronounce
Said loud sound lot like equate idea try improve make thing workplace
Yes Kaizen lead calmer productive workplace provides better patient care
Kaizen seems like simple concept really
But Japanese word intimidating people healthcare workplace outside Japan
Does broader idea improvement scare intimidate people level
Hang little word might one powerful word concept improving healthcare process quality
Hospitals around world using concept often part broader Lean management initiative
The period adoption started around proven hospital healthcare organization improve highly engaged workforce focused providing value patient minimizing waste delivery care
Many organization embrace idea Kaizen practice specific principle call Continuous Improvement Process Excellence instead Kaizen
That perfectly fine call matter much patient benefit staff engagement organizational improvement achieve practice
Everybody know healthcare organization professional around world lot pressure improve
The need improvement includes dimension quality patient safety cost waiting time morale healthcare provider employee
Kaizen proving part solution problem
Read emergency medicine physician initiated formal kaizen program Vanderbilt University Medical Center reading Imai book
After hospital success engaging resident physician kaizen published journal
Jacobson summarized following key kaizen principle One key point kaizen leader ask employee look cost saving
Experience shown healthcare professional get excited saving money primary goal
They however get excited reducing risk harm patient improving patient family experience reducing frustration irritation continually appear workday
The good news using kaizen focus type improvement engage people yield cost saving sometimes increased revenue end result
Many kaizen idea naturally bubble based problem staff member see daily basis
But leader also ask employee idea tie hospital balanced scorecard true north goal objective

Kaizen methodology philosophy improvement
suggest improvement improvement effort would adopt Kaizen approach
It necessary idea go steering successful result
That good solid Lean thinking Kaizen thinking
Read Jeff idea management system Kaizen work together
Sure
I think way organization like ThedaCare use structured start sounding like Lean mindset kaizen approach even
There many example book Lean Solutions including Fujitsu key aspect Kaizen process SHARE completed improvement others
That key principle Joe Iida talked connection Kaizen small improvement innovation larger improvement together lead practice Kaizen requires certain positivity
Instead pointing remind practice Kaizen continuous improvement methodology working toward something CAN Be implemented teach Kaizen methodology
Effective improvement ranking sorting idea wish label Kaizen practice daily Kaizen daily continuous improvement critical get staff member idea Kaizen process ask problem need solved free That exactly Kaizen
This mindset approach requires leader set aside ego habit
management
Managers answer
Instead dictating thing get done expecting obedience compliance manager need work together employee define work done
Managers need ask employee idea improving workplace practice This mindset approach requires leader set aside ego habit
management
Managers answer
Instead dictating thing get done expecting obedience compliance manager need work together employee define work done
Managers need ask employee idea improving workplace practice kata small improvement kaizen lead measurable forcing people change
Lean engaging everybody improvement
The Kaizen methodology especially engages everybody improvement matter patient
This Kaizen approach improvement usually get started small baby step
Any small improvement consistent widespread focus structured improvement
But rigorous daily Kaizen approach magically organized Kaizen approach value idea every employee
Those longest expert Kaizen process team I encourage people bring problem forward even NOT I also tried embrace continuous improvement aspect practice Kaizen
On page Sherman writes Do It Groups sound bit like Kaizen
system two core pillar equally important pillar Toyota called continuous improvement respect outcome expecting predicting hoping
This true practicing Kaizen otherwise going rigorous PDSA cycle
A failure reframed engaging frontline staff member small continuous improvement would call Kaizen Lean alternative suggestion box
An effective Kaizen program engages people far constructive must something Kaizen business futility
I think I know I seen happen adoption robust Kaizen Kaizen philosophy key part Lean drawing idea input everybody thing like We time Lean We time Kaizen
It happens lot built around Kaizen model continuous improvement
One critical aspect Kaizen manager simply I amazing day yesterday major health I blog later
I guest see progress Lean continuous improvement Kaizen
Kaizen process team I encourage people bring problem forward even NOT Kaizen Japanese word good change usually used context continuous improvement
See Toyota web page term Kaizen say Kaizen I really surprised discover Berwick written kaizen continuous improvement famed New England Journal could perhaps card bulletin board make sure following approach instead suggestion box blamed hospital problem going willing participate Kaizen continuous continuous improvement starting put expectation participating Kaizen job description
They asked people previous improvement effort job Lean good
Our topic today tie nicely Lean Kaizen hear conversation every sound like Kaizen Lean especially focused goal matter reducing harm patient
So really needed program engaged employee
So introduced Kaizen This true sadly healthcare well
Too many manager listen employee employee speak manager asking
Leaders responsible creating culture safe speak
Leaders also responsible helping employee take action idea practice Kaizen
classic Kaizen starting point question
How work together make work easier
Solving problem As I shared nurse Franciscan Francis Health love Lean continuous improvement Kaizen We recognize reality make change small engage people Kaizen
That make change le Kaizen improvement process manager need get office conference room TPS includes commitment continuous Kaizen classic Kaizen approach basically described Bohmer writes Major change emerges calmer workplace empowered people make work easier Kaizen explained always looking get better different way
It reminded Kaizen collaborative leader help test idea Plan Study Adjust Kaizen like Kaizen used creativity A pool noodle bungie cord Wrigley telegram incident promising You never going implement another Kaizen idea insulted come encouraging participation everybody improving work environment
That Kaizen
But interesting use word
I guess require willingness change dedicated time personal leadership vision kaizen also emphasized ability help others Kaizen continuous one key contributor result Mary
Not Lean specifically Kaizen embracing idea problem believe strongly employee engagement Kaizen core part Lean philosophy ignored going believe strongly employee engagement Kaizen core part Lean philosophy ignored going generally think continuous improvement mean Kaizen model everybody improving everywhere every day see video Masaaki I talk organization Kaizen continuous improvement far much talk people say thing Kaizen model continuous improvement different old fashioned suggestion box help people grow engaging Kaizen improvement great way instead viewing cost Kaizen process engaging people identifying problem testing improvement idea requires teamwork
Teamwork requires mutual respect respect leader start creating respectful environment
really bad sign
That part culture trying change Lean Kaizen principle
To credit organization trying create culture continuous I talk organization Kaizen continuous improvement far much talk people say thing quick win would
That classic advice start Kaizen approach improvement start building culture continuous I ask people health system practicing Kaizen much time spend improvement
They idea I call Kaizen important part complete nutritious management sound like practice Kaizen continuous improvement

Kaizen Japanese mean improvement
In modern business definition Kaizen expanded mean continuous ongoing improvement
Typically far understanding concept Kaizen go professional
True Kaizen go much farther brief overview origin illustrate
Kaizen began World War II realm
Kaizen started manufacturing specifically automotive manufacturing Toyota
During time Toyota implemented quality circle worker would analyze work regular basis come way could improved
This activity regular reflection change intent improving birth Kaizen
Kaizen became popular Western world particularly United States
In publication Masaaki Imai book Kaizen Japanese Spirit Improvement exposed manufacturing enterprise concept Kaizen
This began movement embrace concept order improve manufacturing efficiency profitability
Kaizen began converging software development Agile development methodology began take shape early
In release book drew heavily principle lean manufacturing Kaizen established foundational principle software development
Unfortunately good programmer may consider Kaizen something achieve may understand need done
You need understanding Kaizen mean current level experience action appropriate help engage effectively Kaizen
True Kaizen management jargon
It deeper initiative project
It culture personal philosophy guide organization individual higher level quality efficiency success
You practice Kaizen learning new technique refactoring code easier maintenance better performance eliminating bug software
Kaizen focus reduction
It seek eliminate muda useless waste process practice
Bugs useless waste
Inefficient routine useless waste
Overburdened process laden red tape bureaucracy useless waste
To true Kaizen must seek deficiency root code system thinking
When practicing Kaizen seek improvement
No activity endeavor ever reach perfection Kaizen process product improve
Kaizen achieved one step time master state Shu state following Ha state innovation Ri state flow
Each state build upon mastery one
Each progression one state next progression Kaizen
Let explore stage Kaizen help determine state currently
Through example provided learn action take order contribute Kaizen based career programmer
At beginning career programmer enter state Shu
To master state begin watching following form programming technique strategy experienced programmer mentor guiding
Each iteration Hello World diligently type start path new language first step mastering Shu
Shu precise repetition form syntax function
Shu allows deviation
You receive instruction study area seeking become proficient strive match form
Kaizen Shu replication work master form function
The form master exist book teach language syntax course programming code colleague supervisor
These form developed experienced programmer refined teach syntax language step step
With step programming capability grow
The programmer build strength reflex replication
As become familiar syntax language reproduce become capable solving problem
You instinctively know feature function language trying accomplish
You also learn efficient way solve problem
The pattern imitate designed teach efficient programming solution
When able recall precisely code write efficient eliminates waste form processing time maintenance time application
When mastered Shu able replicate form mentor asks
You deviate
Your code indistinguishable mentor code
This desirable code mentor produced model quality performance maintainability capable producing prior course study mentor
When achieve predictability precision achieved Kaizen state Shu
My first experience Shu came I copied program book magazine memory Atari computer
I working disk drive program ephemeral
When stopped running computer powered program I written disappeared
This experience taught careful precise mimicking program I studied
If I successful I working program enjoy
If I failed work I completed useless redone
Painful learning valuable experience
As start path learning resource available I
From budding web developer many free course beginning learn programming available
I recommend starting free tutorial online
They walk beginning step help memorize syntax need learn start becoming proficient programming language choice
Once comfortable basic head
This repository open source project allow download source code
Find basic application project would like learn code
Download source code start reproducing code editor
This may sound like simple exercise copying code precisely difficult seems
You also question undertake effort encounter new technique
Take note research topic question ask mentor explain concept completed transcribing code
You find rapidly gaining insight programming language work
Once learned syntax chosen programming language seek expand knowledge uncover function way
You ready progress Shu state following Ha state innovation
Once mastered Shu posse understanding form behaves
You understand efficiently
You know timing processing
You know output file size CPU utilization
It understanding allow progress state Ha state innovation
Innovation programming come combination form syntax algorithm larger system
You learn design pattern solve problem
These pattern emerge organically experience exposure pattern programmer working closely formal study historical solution
In Ha departing mimicry advancing skill
This growth improves value Kaizen
If mentor follow formal course study still learn pattern although path Kaizen slower
Your experience case advance experimentation
Through experiment see approach worthwhile approach
The learning slow
If learn others use formal course study pattern progress toward Kaizen much faster
Depending situation may may right course
If goal advance skill rapidly possible path often direct goal
However seeking deepen knowledge time factor learning experimentation may right choice
Before I first began study programming college method experimentation
I would come idea something I wanted program I would start blank page
I would work compile debug refactor I tried accomplish functionality I set build
As I ran area I familiar I would stop research become familiar
I produce feature rapid pace I gain thorough understanding different aspect programming language BASIC worked
It took nearly month create simple program accepted person name phone number address displayed screen formatted like Rolodex card
My throughput painfully slow end I learned quite bit BASIC solve problem
Once I took first professional programming position experience changed dramatically
Time became essential factor learning
IBM willing wait learning progress slow pace
Instead sent training rapidly improve skill
I learned SQL via Oracle training course
When I returned work training next week I produced report I struggling
The formalized coursework condensed learning much smaller window I felt understanding good bit superficial learning I undertaken
In case I able apply knowledge I acquired solve complex problem deliver better solution I able I completed study
I moved toward Kaizen improved skill speed
In first instance though I felt I deeper grasp I building
In second I reached required proficiency level quickly capability narrower
In first I generalist second specialist
Once comfortable innovation whether generalist specialist ready next state state flow
When enter state Ri reached place form mastered innovation wrought elevated ability
These elevated ability allow contribute highest level Kaizen
You flow challenge presented
You seek make system better last
You strive better performance le maintenance
You strive simplified rather complex system without sacrificing function
You peak technical ability never forget learn
In state Ri contribute Kaizen le advanced programmer
You guide programmer experiencing Ha
You provide advice programmer Ha improve system experience growth capability
You construct form programmer experiencing Shu seek imitate
In Ri use experience improve form novice programmer begin path mastery
In way path mastery shortened improved programmer emerge even highly skilled point career
In current role experience allows provide mentorship junior programmer
I pair write code answer question review produced
I offer guidance allows produce efficient maintainable code
There two way Kaizen improves due process First junior programmer gain knowledge
They learn technique obtain skill
They opportunity ask question answer better understand solution
From effectively wield tool disposal
Second improved capability improves organization Kaizen enhanced efficiency
Junior programmer produce better code reduce processing time cost reduce time take maintain system
This allows organization focus energy resource new undertaking allow generate revenue
In addition mentorship experience mean I called create standard architecture process improve efficiency organization
These process procedural form programmer learn memorize follow become effective role
These foundation form programmer Shu base learning
In Ri likely fill one two role team lead architect
As architect create blueprint system
You consider best practice nuance solution built
Your architecture provides efficient way programmer build quality system
Kaizen improves due contribution increased efficiency
As team lead person junior programmer
Your experience allows answer question solve problem quickly
You provide direction team member goal producing system spread Kaizen throughout organization
Throughout career advance learning state Shu Ha Ri
In state contribution Kaizen different
In Shu focused internal Kaizen
You learn form foundation quality seek become master mimicry
When precisely mimic form studied ready advance next state Ha
In Ha focus Kaizen innovation
You seek use combine form mastered new way
You seek advice mentor study work others gain deeper understanding improve innovation
You continually look way innovation improve process organization part
When mastered art innovation contribution flow ready move state Ri
In Ri become mentor architect leader experience leading
You provide vision system build
You mentor junior programmer help advance skill knowledge
You lead team answering question solving problem state flow continually add Kaizen organization
Kaizen continuous improvement
It accumulation small improvement reduction waste time amount astounding accomplishment
Your accomplishment come advancement knowledge novice master
You learn able solve problem well beyond capability started
You create new solution unique drastically improve current system
In end accomplishment lead help inspire others achieve higher level Kaizen
Each small step toward improvement contribution Kaizen
What step take today
I worked information technology since I graduated college
I began consultant IBM focused database development administration moved focus website development
Over next ten year I added experience information security software development methodology project management product management portfolio
Now I work business deliver solution improve process help achieve goal time saving cost reduction increased profit

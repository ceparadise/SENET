Just another weblog By Chief Strategy Officer I recently asked I heard reference executive team utilize war room strategy development
Is beneficial Let begin stating tool technique bring executive team together purpose consistent focused strategy development refinement marvelous thing
Furthermore company I run least one war room executive team often time war room assigned business unit department
In today post I cover benefit associated war room I like refer place good thing Are meeting area conference facility board room used
Perhaps point used effectively
When I see conference room look main purpose existence serve corporate art museum I tend question exists
I recently spent two day site new client
The client exquisite headquarters facility number absolutely gorgeous conference room
However two day site I observe utilized
When I asked CEO said nobody us Let start wonderful technology small global footprint become workforce really disconnected least personally point history
Even worker office location busy busy virtually collaborating often spend enough focused time one another working key issue
Rather sequestering talent behind closed door individual office spreading hither yon cube farm consider benefit bringing together purpose accomplishing something specific
Executive team come together often enough meeting often productive try cover far much ground short period time
I always amazed I witness company take talent boardroom hour two accomplish virtually nothing
Likewise project team work group become creature habit prefer use internet software based toolsets substitute power highly focused intense personal interaction
As noted much easier safer disengaged productive
In case I think At first blush one might think concept war room bit Orwellian form old school management theory nothing could truth
In fact study shown worker may initially resist idea working close quarter purpose increasing intensity extended period time benefit collaboration productivity quickly win
By way example University Michigan produced study war room find worker functioning war room environment twice productive counterpart working traditional office arrangement
Where possible I firm believer workgroups spend much time possible war room environment
I would take far suggest one consider best form collaborative workspace configuration therefore make default space plan choice possible
With regard executive team rarely find executive subject arrangement obviate need war room
As stated earlier executive team spend nearly enough focused time together simply committing one per week cloistered war room together improve efficiency productivity
Following point consideration building executive war room The bottom line commit giving war room chance find productivity soar executive begin embrace concept thing normally carried forward meeting meeting rollover agenda item consistently crossed list

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I seen couple web agency using term War room describe place sit brainstorm web project
The room usually contains lot sketch wall look impressive What component effective war room environment
If war room I say comment perfect
Especially coffee
Do forget coffee
However used might component use effective creative brainstorm session
Make sure people inside room
Provide basic need order keep focussed Might exactly information seeking I sure hope contribution somehow help Also need information organize brainstorm session Wikipedia offer information basic technique And seriously forget coffee
In describing place sit brainstorm term perhaps appropriate
The term originated term describe command control center wage real war
The English Churchill used World War II example
A key characteristic war room need keep participant constantly updated rapidly changing situation
The emphasis effective display data
If watch old war movie see lot people moving pin map using grease pencil show ship plane
Today war room lot phone line laptop tablet flat screen display wall etc
Today war room typically used crisis limited duration natural disaster
Since nature use unpredictable room flexible possible
Think hurricane nuclear plant explosion
A perhaps le dramatic use company might CEO plane crash web server destroyed
Since people often called unexpectedly need remain indeterminate amount time essential provide everything required food supply etc operate peak performance
Often sleeping bathing facility provided well
A similar war room without sense urgency
People work regular hour go home end day
The external event driving time line
What common requirement effectively visualize share idea information
Any tool sketchpads even back napkin way full blown animation appropriate
To get maximum benefit think tank session provision made record document session
Use facilitator scribe along video camera may highly appropriate provided inhibit information sharing thing people want say camera
The one constant reason either brainstorm war room successful always experience least
This hardest job person need able sense discussion keep everyone task keep momentum going also really good feel let people go tangent needed
The best experience I creative director way good everyone lot fun crazy harnessing get good idea
He also Why
person helped u think overall vision instead tactical approach
And one thing consistently done better anyone else tell everyone even ideation process need go
After sometime would always narrow approach based come took thought potential told u would go path
We would start working would set direction
This way much freedom fun direction clear everyone happier
Not getting stuck still giving process time need

The term war room derived military military use make war strategy one room room equipped map location device etc assist locate troop
War room single point responsible people present make decision troop movement enemy location finalize move counter enemy
Modern industry adopted concept
But business meeting room called warroom equipped computer chart projector etc instead map location device
All responsible agency present discus issue
I think confuson started capitalising WAR make seem like acronym
war room maybe War Room
The metaphor call mind old war movie general staff load map chart move piece around
Still question
Ask

In last two year Google Ventures I done startup
One simplest trick I learned dedicated space war help u better work
The wall war room extend team memory provide canvas shared act storage work progress
Unfortunately war room far
I surprised many tech company make space foosball table fun seldom used yet dedicate room important project
If team war room worry
In post I explain put one together almost budget
Spoiler dedicated physical space great absolute necessity
But first bit war room work well
To solve complex design problem need track lot moving part
As human spatial memory
Plaster room note take advantage spatial memory
You begin know information extends ability remember thing
We know better prioritized list sticky note diagram make decision verbally
That whiteboards meeting room people love agile tracker sticky note
War room take tool next level
War room help team work better together
When put wall wonder everyone page
The room page
The put wall shared understanding build
As bonus spend le time revisiting issue
A war room work great project day also work great meeting
In Google Ventures design sprint common many thing wall user story diagram research note printout existing UI sketch possible solution detailed storyboard sometimes
To accommodate stuff need lot space
That mean whiteboards window empty wall stick stuff
You want war room turning another conference room
For best result remove war room company calendar
Whiteboards come lot style choose wisely
In design sprint go lot different work mode
Sometimes need want chair open space
Other time want desk
The ideal war room furniture lightweight wheel easy move
We took conference room removed big table middle
Next installed many whiteboards could
We got close
Finally ordered bunch flexible like Modernica chair utilitarian like clipboard coat hanger
Here Google Ventures Daniel Burka
Some highlight It may impossible completely take room
If share war room get portable wall space assemble disassemble quickly
Your option Sometimes even conference room commandeer
I seen challenge startup incubator shared office
Don freak
You still make war room hacking space around desk
Use rolling whiteboards partition
It like kid building fort chair blanket
But actually use blanket might get creeped
We still experimenting learning war room well company
How set project space team
Jake design partner Google Ventures
He created Google Ventures design sprint process run sprint startup like Nest Blue Bottle Coffee Foundation Medicine

Help please
When config spec start work
When I click CHECK OUT CHECK IN
I I config spec I modify I change config spec Then I Check I created
BUT WHY
The config spec apply rule update checkout checkin think would
On checkin new version created branch checked
That new version might new config spec BUT branch checked NOT changed said new config spec
Changing checked change anything
It checked
Now create version checkin even second config spec need realize future take place branch This config spec would make sure new version first checkin done The rule important first one applied win
pother ignored
See concrete example config spec
Note first checkin get new version created explained
Yet second config spec select
That incorrect rule second config spec This one would select right version But second config spec rule regarding still selected version created rule applied

CNET forum help best source finding solution computer problem
You find discussion fixing problem computer hardware computer software Windows well network
I really looking thin lightweight computer
I looked MacBook Air I love everything except price processor speed OS
I know change Windows BootCamp slows computer little hastle
But computer could I
Here prospect spec Under pound Thickness Processor Speed higher preferably Intel Under Preferably Solid State Drive Also I completely wrong computer I looking towards please let know simply What would good computer Computer Science college
If asking technical help please sure include system info including operating system model number specific related problem
Also please exercise best judgment posting forum revealing personal information address telephone number address recommended
Most student want longer life span SSD advanced still finite life span device
The spec suspect Computer Science student would quibble inch versus LB versus
Your money something sound right
Bob If ask question like I question whether computer science degree going good fit
I run many computer science graduate might virtuoso Java come actually using program develop completely utterly lost
For example comment Boot Camp slows computer show little understanding Boot Camp
It collection Windows driver boot loader
So unless making broad sweeping generalization choose either Windows OS X every boot Boot Camp wo impact performance one way
Someone going succeed software development able discern observing program work
Also incoming freshman college even bother thinking laptop probably least two year
Once declared major actually get class major think thing
However people first two year college basically accelerated repeat high school
You spending first two year english class prereqs
You wo get anywhere near hardcore coding theory class
Also SSD software development would bad idea
You wear much faster average person temporary file compiler generate
Not mention larger project need lot storage space
You source file compiled version individual source file top executable support library built
These thing someone interested software development already aware considered hope much chance profession
Note This post edited forum moderator remove unnecessary paragraph life lesson
AM PT Not sure moderator would want remove valuable information like student loan debt survive declaring bankruptcy
It widely known fact many people end finding hard way
With tuition rate going double digit every semester taking time really think degree want pursue save LOT money whatever debt rack hound wherever go
It may something OP want hear moment final analysis probably agree something needed hear
That several indicator post suggest would making costly mistake going CS career
The CS field cutthroat one
You company like Microsoft swearing visa enough people graduating US university fill open job
Study study shown anything glut people coming US university company essentially bought enough politician keep getting increase number visa issued every year
A lot larger US based company come mind think software development simply interested hiring US citizen
That really tip iceberg labor abuse go pretty much standard practice much tech industry
Software developer one openly discriminated lot legal case
Like I tell someone looking major English Century Russian Poetry
Even burning passion consumes waking hour way going able make living
To work software developer generally invite treated like garbage
And good day
Things college telling student never college business quite happy let flush money proverbial toilet useless degree
Thank great information
I simply asked question computer judge book cover
But I greatly appreciate advice
I questioned whether go computer science
I really enjoy programming really want get better pretty much using computer
If computer science major propose
I going business I successful I want something I enjoy
Something along working computer programming
Do recommend Game Design
IT
Thank given great insight
If like programming plenty opportunity without get degree
You could get started open source project example
There plenty Windows even Linux
You involved free time hobby
Game design probably bad choice well
It sound great read story people work industry work insane hour
Based story I seen hour workweek uncommon week making final push get game door
It also become formulaic day one wanting take chance trying something new
So like cranking like Grand Theft Auto clone time time time much social life knock
IT bad either crazy good knowledge specific program platform people
People know thing like program custom SAP module example practically write check
The catch wo find SAP anywhere outside enterprise government
It big expensive
Database admins make decent money current love affair business cloud dwindling demand
My personal advice would get minor even double major something completely unrelated computer still enjoy
Just long something like Psychology need Masters someone research assistant
The IT world brutal
There plenty company simply want hire US citizen like constantly lobbying increase visa
Then also get company like ASUS discriminate unless specific race ethnicity
At least based experience friend mine corroborating comment people
ASUS employee give take friend saying number employee single digit
Not Asian employee seemed ethnically Chinese Taiwanese guess ASUS headquartered manufacturing
The math difficult one
From I heard Asian friend mine Asian tech company incredibly abusive even Asian employee Asian everyone else company basically descend upon like pack hyena basically
The simple truth unless luck working company treat employee like people instead cattle becoming increasingly rare burn quickly IT
You discriminated based age well IT
That work new college grad every month fresh group new college grad work lot le established life like
A maybe spouse kid pet car etc
Sooner later company looking lay staff raise promotion racked year make look like appealing candidate chopping block
So make sure fallback option age anything IT umbrella start become increasingly unemployable
It right fair reality getting worse
All politician get office come new interesting way defang agency like EEOC charged preventing sort thing millionaire billionaire benefactor make even money expense rest u
I ca stress enough important fallback option
Anyway rant going go IT advice would make sure skill set diverse possible
Do expect college course teach anything
Buy cheap older computer install Linux
Make sure know way around command line graphical environment like GNOME KDE
Just try thing heck worry break something
Learning fix broke valuable experience
Linux also wealth development tool opportunity get head start learning write code
Expose many different thing possibly make sure focus thing
The best way I think explaining spend time memorizing every single feature MS Word located
Spend time learning word processor work
So matter using WordPerfect anything else le equally proficient
Or put programming term every language basic construct variable loop keywords etc
A loop C work pretty much way loop
The syntax little different basic construct
Once learn pick almost language day since learning new key word slightly different structure
It like went England Australia speak English able understand everyone part sometimes word phrase unique particular dialect need learn
Focus thing different
And part ca stressed enough expose many different thing possible
If put experience program resume person interviewing ask right
Even better person interview familiar relatively obscure program impressed also know
Wow
That amazing
So thoroughly impressed thank much great information
It hard think response perfectly described situation really opened eye
I think I go computer science I eye set said look backup major even major separate programmer
Maybe business major I could take knowledge make business
Obviously I need thinking info gave going archive one great great advice
LOL remembring Charlie Chan show
She graduated Civil Engineer majored concrete structure currently work Maryland SHA
The one thing always complained using laptop school battery life
The second pain weak internal wireless
For switched using USB wifi device USB cord could move around best reception
Of course battery life past hour considered almost miracle
Since time charge issue college consider laptop economical low power squeeze every possible minute needing recharge
Another complaint fan making hot spot lap heat output factor consider
All point le speed economy use conveniently also mean economical price high powered laptop
Less spent computer battery power extra RAM advantage
As Robert pointed RAM may let run without pagefile save future writes SSD drive may installed laptop
You also turn lot logging activity save writes SSD add back bit speed
half price get hour cell battery
You also might consider running Linux later virtual box dual boot need power hog
That especially true go computer science programming
For instance info computer I using type time running Mint Linux day
I typically leave time since low power chip
Tonight I hour usual still using le MB GB RAM available
What looking utility use le power
I check college recommends preferred supplier
A remark You might prefer model serviced local repair shop case trouble model must send central service center state even worse country get back week later
Having working laptop might essential student Computer Science
If curriculum includes Game design might specific requirement graphic
If curriculum includes Linux consider ascertan install Linux separate partition
That somewhat easier running virtual machine
If curriculum includes lot graphic design might even recommend Macbook
Kees That great advice I thinking getting MacBook Pro seem powerful lot RAM SSD I put Windows BootCamp I switch OS whenever I want
What think
One best French door fridge tested A fridge useful feature like water pitcher FlexZone drawer
It performer cooling test

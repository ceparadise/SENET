Colocation useful
Colocation handy
But colocation necessary come agile team
No
Not possible effectively manage distributed agile team many benefit
Colocation overrated represents reaction fixing communication comprehension problem occur working agile team member different part world
The business reality employee single location next impossible build maintain
The system build inflexibility next thing know certain people allowed work home others required come daily
For example may critical keep one software engineer happy
So engineer work schedule want
Another potential problem tight market business may end keeping people job good enough
Both scenario sake maintaining colocated team even half work home
This creates unfair environment lead employee dissatisfaction
In way inflexible reduces
I know experience possible work different office remote employee easily whether ever meet
I also tell software engineer prefer using instant messaging tool email actual conversation majority time
Most development staff need time space concentrate many care interrupted directly disrupts ability create produce
It matter field working constantly interrupted annoying counterproductive
Colocation useful meeting require close listening design discussion
Whiteboarding design highly effective person managed online tool well
Colocation handy new employee training need amount encouragement
Otherwise development staff knowledgeable experienced mature simply necessary success
Communication style differ managed effectively learning communicate various way
Employees connect anywhere secure Internet connection employment restricted particular location
Communication variability essential
If going employee based different office area must invest communication equipment fit job including software laptop communication network
Do rely freeware resource test first
Consider using backup option specified tool fail
For example purchase GoToMeeting teleconferencing communication problem keep Skype handy use instead
Perhaps instead email opt using tool like Slack
What important licensed organized system employee know use
Consistent tool use help reduce confusion tool use
Also keep security implication mind selecting tool employee likely discussing displaying proprietary information
It essential selected tool contains sufficient security security used properly configured
Provide phone headphone work network system heard clearly possible
Plan equipping conference room main office communication equipment like SMART board monitor
Additionally business need strong reliable Internet provider
Two advantage distributed development team flexibility coverage
For example business exists Pacific time zone second third office exist Central time zone Australia company resource working available around clock
Say dozen test complete San Francisco office
Those tester push unfinished test tester Central time zone office
They office three additional hour necessary test completed workday start Australian office
Development story managed using Kanban agile scrum board worked across time zone
If engineer A finish engineer B take story complete workday yet
Work task flow ca flow across engineer still progress made frequently
If sharing story work awkward story assigned way story worked simultaneously
Distributed team independent worker nature
Your employee may available work overnight varied schedule
Employees may able switch take task work best area talent
experienced limiting talent pool one geographic area exceptionally restrictive
Distributed engineer work anywhere secured Internet connection business hire developer around globe across US avoiding need handle employee move pay higher price certain area
The ability manage hire distributed team much desired skill
The wave future flexible working team work across boundary

A also known usually refers group individual work together different geographic location rely email FAX video voice conferencing service order collaborate
The term also refer group team work together asynchronously across organizational level
Powell Piccoli Ives define virtual team group geographically organizationally time dispersed worker brought together information telecommunication technology accomplish one organizational task
According Ale Ebrahim et
al
virtual team also defined small temporary group geographically organizationally time dispersed coordinate work predominantly electronic information communication technology order accomplish one organization task
Members virtual team may never meet
Virtual team made possible proliferation significantly increased scope
Virtual team allow company procure best talent without geographical restriction
According Hambley Kline virtual team require new way working across boundary system process technology people requires effective leadership despite widespread increase virtual teamwork relatively little focus role virtual team leader
There three main aspect virtual team purpose people link
While purpose important aspect critical aspect virtual team purpose hold virtual team together
Virtual team common structure may organization purpose brings hold team together
Purpose generally translated certain action step people work defined structure consisting common goal individual task result
A number factor may affect performance member virtual team
For example team member higher degree focused attention aggregate lower level temporal dissociation may higher performance
Further member higher degree attention focus may prefer asynchronous communication channel low level flow may prefer synchronous communication channel
Powell Piccoli Ives found investigated article virtual team concluded current research found four main focus area
virtual team mean simply forming VT planned
This mean structuring interaction kind communication tool used much time possible etc
Research found team building exercise establishment shared norm Sarker et establishment clear team structure help team succeed
Kirkman et al
found empirically meeting improved empowerment virtual team lead better learning
Numerous communication problem diverted creating shared knowledge database order allow team member information know others
As added bonus shared knowledge database also share language mental model substitute important time
Furthermore shared mental model focused designing requiring team create goal strategy
This shown clearly improve team With also coordination problem obstacle effective communication involved
These problem may solved actively understanding accepting difference culture
The team seems positive effect team performance satisfaction belonging team
At time high trust found develop
On hand relationship technology task performance found dependent experience technology group membership type task group working
Diverse technological skill create conflict among team
This team consistent improve team performance
For instance mentoring good way make personal tie experienced virtual team professional
According Tan et consistent training foster cohesiveness trust teamwork commitment team goal individual satisfaction higher perceived decision quality
In article taught communication technique called dialogue technique
It created three stage small talk sharing mental model norm building
The overall result found virtual team exhibit higher task conflict lower communication frequency knowledge sharing performance satisfaction
Although finding consistent previous research result suggest result generalize type team methodological approach
Virtualness different effect team depending
For team leaner medium misattributions subgroup potentially contribute le effective team
In team member make fewer misattributions person interact longer time frame develop relationship
Also longer time span teammate build group identity help overcome difference
There negative effect team performance satisfaction team conflict actually decreased degree virtualness increased
Although negative effect communication frequency knowledge sharing effect much le team compared team
Virtualness also varying influence team depending virtualness measured well length time team working together
The negative effect effect team disappeared longer term team
Their result also showed different effect virtualness depending type analysis used individual group method experiment survey virtual work
This section introduces emotional problem involved mitigation tactic needed achieve cohesion trust among team member
Overall research report positive link process outcome virtual team project
Because geographical distribution time occurs rarely
This according research result weaker social link lead team socially focused
If meeting feasible meeting held much possible beginning team formation order bring closer form interpersonal bond
These meeting focus actual business
However socializing different cultural preference remembered
If meeting possible feasible desired extent approach applied
done partially via electronic communication tool
Jarvenpaa Leidner study found team communicate socially achieve higher trust better social emotional relationship
Leaders help foster relationship building general team building many way
providing continuous feedback listening team opinion suggestion clearly stating team member role consistency leadership style
mean sense unity team
Cohesion important virtual team associated better performance greater satisfaction
Cohesion trust important fostering team effectiveness
It found take away development cohesion within Virtual Teams traditional team higher level team cohesiveness
Another study found although virtual team may start low cohesion time exchange enough social information develop strong cohesion
In comparing men woman perception cohesion virtual team Lind found woman virtual team men traditional team perceived greater team cohesiveness men virtual team
However virtual team difficulty attaining cohesion
Research development virtual team centered relationship building specifically team cohesion trust
Relationship building deal interaction increase inclusiveness
process outcome virtual team project closely related virtual team need meet need virtual team member order successful
particularly problematic subject virtual team arguable whether people expected trust never met
Furthermore trust noted crucial successful team usually much time build little little often team project
Jarvenpaa Leidner describe mechanism people solve trust problem short time
It called suggests team member assume beginning team member trustworthy
They adjust assumption lifetime team
Jarvenpaa Leidner also researched difference team high level trust beginning team high amount trust end compared
To achieve high trust early group life team social enthusiastic communication coped well technical uncertainty took individual initiative
The group enjoyed trust later predictable communication timely response positive leadership ability move social communication communication
The integrity team member important development trust perception member benevolence support maintenance trust time
meeting beginning stage team become virtual help develops strong trust
Task process action team member carry order accomplish goal complete project
The three main part task process communication coordination fit
one crucial thing virtual team
Communication vital success virtual team crucial team group excellent communicator proper technology best level communication
It start selecting excellent communicator team member right technology use
Virtual communication technology cause many difficulty effective team communication time delay common reference frame difference interpretation assurance participation remote team member
Some empirically found challenge successful communication virtual team failure communicate due wrong lacking contextual information unevenly distributed information interpretation meaning silence technical problem
Nonverbal communication vital team communication also missing virtual team
Traditional team communicate effectively virtual team
Difficulties often arise team member others geographically distant
There assumption team member communicate information communicated distant member cause friction member
Leadership cultural difference also substantially affect effectiveness communication
The frequency predictability communication much feedback provided regularly improves effectiveness communication lead greater team trust improves team performance
On hand inconsistent infrequent communication reduces coordination success virtual team
One common reason team member leave short amount time without communicating absence member
However virtual team found communicate frequently normal team virtual team higher communication combined gender virtual team
Higher effective communication shown improve cultural understanding
Inequalities hierarchy within group reduced via email communication also make easier access higher level employee due difficulty scheduling face face meeting
However minority member likely express opinion anonymous condition though opinion accepted condition
CMC group create hierarchy try preserve status quota
bias found student group Cramton
Lateral communication virtual team important team ability adapt change especially moving Virtual Teams
Lateral communication improved creating flatter reporting structure hierarchy well using computer mediated communication tool
The extensive reliance communication technology lead reduced effect difficulty management compared traditional team
Researchers found solution problem
One company created reward system team cooperation encourage people actively accurately communicate
On hand according Pink research rewarding creativity rewarding communication sustainable way encourage cooperation
In another company emphasized need debate well merely share information
Predictability feedback also frequently improve communication effectiveness creating trust better team performance
In addition one study researcher tested question whether adding video electronic communication help explain detailed task map route another person
They found native speaker pair bring additional benefit speaker pair brought significant improvement task
much combined effort exists various part organization consistent coherent
Coordination positively associated virtual team performance
However difficult virtual team coordinate across time zone cultural divide divergent mental model
The development type collaboration norm within team necessary team meld team member contribution
meeting especially helping leading successful project
If meeting possible formal protocol communication training improves coordination collaboration activity
Minimizing cultural barrier also improves coordination team member
It naturally difficult coordinate virtual team different time zone culture mental model
Collaboration norm develop team function well
As mentioned periodical meeting good way form relationship also good vehicle coordinate activity drive project forward
When meeting feasible one alternative develop coordination protocol communication training
Ramesh Dennis suggested standardizing input process output
This help team coordinate help party
The fit examines possible fit various technology available Studies hypothesized technology fit depends individual preference
experience use urgency task The technology used dependent personal preference previous experience technology ease use need documenting project activity urgent task
found meeting phone call suitable ambiguous task managing conflict managing external resource brainstorming strategic talk
Electronic communication suitable structured task routine analysis examining design tradeoff monitoring project status
Interestingly study team first adjusted organization technology hand later also adjusted technology organization
Output virtual team mean thing come work process team
Decision quality one output virtual team
The majority research found significant evidence difference decision quality virtual traditional team number idea generated
However Chidambaram Bostrom found virtual team generate idea compared traditional team
As many constraint working virtually virtual team require longer time reach decision When comparing performance traditional virtual team result mixed
Some study find traditional team virtual team better
The majority study found team level
Powell Piccoli Ives list many study found different factor make virtual team successful
The found factor The result different student study mixed concerning working virtual team
Tan et al
found team used dialogue technique decision made team
One study found traditional team started satisfied virtual team
Then le year satisfaction virtual team rose exceeded satisfaction traditional team
Women satisfied men virtual team also satisfied compared woman traditional team
Team member satisfied likely training used communication method compared unsatisfied team member
Below common type virtual team
Generally networked team geographically distributed necessarily organization
These team frequently created frequently dissolved usually formed discus specific topic member area expertise possibly different organization pitch idea discussion
Depending complexity issue additional member team may added time
The duration team last may vary significantly depending fast slow issue resolved
Parallel team highly task oriented team usually consist specialized professional
While generally required short span time unlike networked team dissolved completion task
The team may either internal external organization
Similar parallel team team geographically distributed may operate different timezones
Project development team mainly focused creating new product information system organizational process user customer
These team exist longer parallel team added ability make decision rather make recommendation
Similar networked team project development team may also add remove member team given time needed area expertise
These team totally function specific work particular area within organization
finance training research etc
Operating virtually different geographical location team exist perform regular ongoing task
Service team geographically located different assigned particular service customer support network upgrade data maintenance etc
Each team work providing particular service daylight hour end day work delegated next team operates different timezone someone handling service hour day
Offshore ISD outsourcing team independent service provider team company subcontract portion work
These team usually work conjunction onshore team
Offshore ISD commonly used software development well international R D project
According The life circle includes five stage The initial task implementation team definition general purpose team together determination level virtuality might appropriate achieve goal
These decision usually determined strategic factor merger increase market span cost reduction flexibility reactivity market etc
activity take place preparation phase includes mission statement personnel selection task design reward system design choose appropriate technology organizational integration
It highly recommended beginning virtual teamwork member meet
Crucial element workshop getting acquainted team member clarifying team goal clarifying role function team member information training communication technology used efficiently developing general rule teamwork
As consequence workshop expected promote clarification team process trust building building shared interpretative context high identification team
Getting acquainted goal clarification development rule also accomplished phase
Initial field data compare virtual team without meeting confirm general positive effect team effectiveness although differentiated research necessary
Experimental study demonstrate getting acquainted start work facilitates cooperation trust
After launch virtual team work effectiveness constructive team climate maintained using performance management strategy
The following discussion restricted issue empirical result already available
These issue leadership communication within virtual team team member motivation knowledge management
Leadership central challenge virtual team
Particularly kind direct control difficult team manager location team member
As consequence delegative management principle considered shift part classic managerial function team member
However team member accept fulfill managerial function motivated identify team goal difficult achieve virtual team
Next empirical result three leadership approach summarized differ degree autonomy team member Electronic monitoring attempt realize directive leadership distance management objective MBO example delegative leadership principle team example rather autonomous teamwork
Communication process perhaps frequently investigated variable relevant regulation virtual teamwork
By definition communication virtual team predominantly based electronic medium telephone etc
The main concern electronic medium reduce richness information exchange compared communication
Predominant research issue conflict escalation disinhibited communication flaming fit communication medium communication content role communication
One important need successful communication ability every member group together repeatedly time
Effective dispersed group show spike presence communication time ineffective group dramatic spike
For management motivational emotional process three group process addressed empirical investigation far motivation trust team identification cohesion satisfaction team member
Since variable originated within person vary considerably among member team requiring appropriate aggregation procedure multilevel analysis
motivation may mediated interpersonal trust
Systematic research needed management knowledge development shared understanding within team particularly since theoretical analysis sometimes lead conflicting expectation
The development common ground might particularly difficult virtual team sharing information development transactive memory know team harder due reduced amount communication reduced information individual work context
Virtual team supported personnel team development intervention
The development training concept based empirical assessment need deficit team member effectiveness training evaluated empirically
The step team development include assessment individual team training evaluation training effect
Finally disbanding virtual team team member important issue neglected empirical also conceptual work virtual team
However particularly virtual project team short reform quickly careful constructive disbanding mandatory order maintain high motivation satisfaction among employee
Members transient project team anticipate end teamwork foreseeable future turn overshadows interaction shared outcome
The final stage group development gradual emotional disengagement includes sadness separation least successful group joy pride achievement team
Cultural diversity shown affect group positive team
Combined collaborative group individual different cultural perspective likely actively participate group decision making
The differing background experience group member also encourage creativity create conflicting viewpoint make likely multiple option explored considered
The side coin virtual team create equal workplace discouraging age race disability discrimination forcing individual interact others whose difference challenge assumption
Physically disadvantaged employee also able participate team communication virtual may previously able due physical limitation office workspace
Virtual team required use technology communicate side effect mitigating problem
For instance email medium communication transfer accent carry fewer noticeable verbal language difference voice communication
Cultural barrier removed team instead shielded view situation irrelevant
In fact simply understanding diversity within team working way around strengthen relationship team member different culture
Virtual team save travel time cost significant expense business multiple location client located multiple place
They also reduce disruption normal workday requiring individual physically leave workspace
This improved efficiency also directly translate saved cost company
A company able recruit larger pool employee using virtual team people increasingly unwilling relocate new job
A growing amount talent would otherwise unobtainable without employee traveling often
The use virtual team also allows employee participate multiple project within company located different site
This turn help company allowing reuse existing resource required hire new employee job
It common cultural difference come global team
Cultural diversity also impairs communication often due language barrier cultural mismatch workplace
Satisfaction among team member virtual team shown le positive satisfaction among team
This drop satisfaction part difficult build trust without communication necessary part virtual team
However effective management adherence proper goal setting principle specific nature work virtual team require lead improved team effectiveness
If team corresponding management prepared challenge virtual team difficult achieve
rarely exists virtual team even often transferred new member contextual knowledge kept well documented
Development type particularly difficult virtual team due indirect method low frequency communication
While team meet person develop naturally virtual team often create artificially ahead time
Virtual team also highlight generational gap may older executive senior manager much experience computer technology younger counterpart
These senior member must make extra effort catch younger generation understand new way communicating
Another problem unique virtual team differing time zone
A part team one side world may asleep another part normal workday group work around
tends difficult manage requires much greater coordination
Team leader need training specifically
Given team member need able share leadership responsibility training program ought developed recognition support
A contribution problem company extensive expertise operate engage virtual team create without understanding differ regular team
Despite improvement telecommunication overcome distance obstacle collaboration working separate location still increase odds people aware
Common ground
mutual knowledge important element successful communication coordinated activity
Working separately technology make difficult detect resolve misunderstanding lack common ground
Technologies video higher medium richness provide context common ground proven effective negotiation
It important consider frequency negotiation everyday conversation
Negotiation meaning happens regularly especially people different background culture
Throughout smaller negotiation made two actor order achieve common ground seen higher medium richness fact improve common ground
The cost difficulty video high medium rich technology show disadvantage virtual collocated team
When come distance need communicate remember difference context often escape collaborator
Collaborators often assume remote partner context forget remote partner hence fail remember communicate essential contextual information remote partner
For instance many recorded case worker going offline public holiday country forget party working different area public holiday hence fail communicate holiday
This failure communicate contextual information inevitably cause misunderstanding cause people jump conclusion mistrust
Other problem include poor decision quality wasted time needed correct lack mutual knowledge
Additionally even contextual information communicated collaborator may still forget
This mean conclusion drawn lack essential contextual information causing misunderstanding
For instance team member may communicate team upcoming trip able communicate within time period
However team forgot still sent request immediate action away
When digital technology used replace communication difficult detect actual message sent received receiver vice versa
For instance collaborator two email address primary secondary one message may sent server primary address secondary address
If partner read message received primary address lot information would lost transmission working partner would different ground
These working partner would wondering message ignored others received incorrect conclusion would drawn leading misunderstanding
Since partner unaware root cause misunderstanding would long time problem brought light lot tension conclusion would drawn
Errors distribution message common technology interaction leading lack common ground
When come interaction speaker may make importance message known tone voice facial expression bodily gesture
The receiver may acknowledge understanding exact feedback called communication head nod brief verbalization like yeah okay smile
These method emphasis feedback ensure party common ground
However method absent scarce digital mean communication
For example exchange easy overlook important point message intended sender
The receiver may interpret message differently giving different part message different priority
In worse case may cause lack action salient part message receiver part
Fully implementing communication
The lack convenient cue digital communication make dispersed collaboration le conducive establishment mutual knowledge
Speed timing communication inevitably uniformed digital communication interaction
This due fact party would restricted access communication others
The difference relative speed timing feedback aggravated difference time zone
In case problem arising difference relative speed may attributed instead lack conscientiousness part slower partner
In fact fluctuating feedback cycle destructive uniformed feedback cycle slower pace
Messages met silence mean variety thing
For example silence due technical problem within technology mediates party involved communication due fact one partner town reply message
Whatever reason silence barrier establishing common ground firstly ambiguity silence
Silence ambiguous interpreted receiving partner many way
For example taken mean agreement disagreement indifference case dispersed group message undelivered
Secondly silence blur notion known unknown group signaling absence common ground

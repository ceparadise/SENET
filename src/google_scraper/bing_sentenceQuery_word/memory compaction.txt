My operating system textbook say compaction process rearranges disk block free disk block form contiguous chunk free disk space
But I always thought defragmentation
Are two term
Or I missing something
In modern disk operating system file subdivided block may stored arbitrary location disk
Files read quickly physical disk block stored consecutively I think every OS created since without difficulty create file larger single largest consecutive free area disk provided total size free area sufficient hold file
Such file end different piece stored different part disk thus accessing often fast entire file stored consecutively
Conceptually ideal disk arrangement would content every file stored consecutively file stored unused block consecutive range
Such arrangement would compacted defragmented
In general though amount effort arrange everything perfectly seldom worthwhile obvious exception disk written never modified would typically case

Defragmenting disk move block make file consecutive sequence block disk necessarily attempt eliminate free area file
Compacting disk consolidate free area moving data later part disk unused location earlier part may cause fragmentation existing file
Generally software performs defragmentation try avoid creating many scattered free area software performs compaction try avoid causing needle fragmentation depending upon software trying
maximize efficiency existing file versus preparing large contiguous area space preparation large operation need run smoothly software may focus one kind operation expense
mean moving memory area eliminate hole caused terminated five process A B C D E allocated memory
After sometime process B D terminated
Now memory layout
After applying compaction instead two memory unit one memory unit
mean storing complete file smallest number contiguous region
That try store file one complete unit size contiguous memory available
Suppose process A fragment process B fragment
Now suppose memory layout defragmentation
Defragmentation also contribute compaction

In form automatic
The attempt reclaim memory occupied longer use
Garbage collection invented around simplify manual memory management
Garbage collection often portrayed opposite requires programmer specify object deallocate return memory system
However many system use combination approach including technique
Like memory management technique garbage collection may take significant proportion total processing time program result significant influence performance
With good implementation enough memory depending application garbage collection faster manual memory management opposite also true often case past GC algorithm
Resources memory database device descriptor typically handled garbage collection
Methods used manage resource particularly may suffice manage memory well leaving need GC
Some GC system allow resource associated region memory collected cause resource reclaimed called
Finalization may introduce complication limiting usability intolerable latency disuse reclaim especially limited resource lack control performs work reclaiming
The basic principle garbage collection find data object program accessed future reclaim resource used object
Many require garbage collection either part example effectively practical implementation example formal language like said
Other language designed use manual memory management implementation available example
Some language like allow garbage collection application using separate collected manually managed object others like allow user manually delete object also entirely disable garbage collection speed required
While integrating garbage collection language enables much wider choice method GC system exist including require recompilation
GC sometimes distinguished
The garbage collector almost always closely integrated
Garbage collection free programmer manually dealing memory deallocation
As result certain category eliminated substantially reduced Some bug addressed garbage collection security implication
Typically garbage collection certain disadvantage including consuming additional resource performance impact possible stall program execution incompatibility manual resource management
Garbage collection consumes computing resource deciding memory free even though programmer may already known information
The penalty convenience annotating object lifetime manually source code lead decreased uneven performance
A paper came conclusion GC need five time memory compensate overhead perform fast explicit memory management
Interaction memory hierarchy effect make overhead intolerable circumstance hard predict detect routine testing
The impact performance also given Apple reason adopting garbage collection despite desired feature
The moment garbage actually collected unpredictable resulting stall pause memory scattered throughout session
Unpredictable stall unacceptable interactive program
Incremental concurrent garbage collector address problem varying
The modern GC implementation try minimize blocking stall much work possible background
separate thread example marking unreachable garbage instance application process continues run
In spite advancement example still difficult maintain large heap million object resident object get promoted older generation without incurring noticeable delay sometimes second
GC incompatible based management resource
As result need explicit manual resource management resource becomes transitive composition
That GC system resource object requires manual resource management object used part another object composed object also become object requires manual resource management
common type garbage collection much garbage collection often refers tracing garbage collection rather method
The overall strategy consists determining object garbage collected tracing object chain reference certain root object considering rest garbage collecting
However large number algorithm used implementation widely varying complexity performance characteristic
Reference counting garbage collection object count number reference
Garbage identified reference count zero
An object reference count incremented reference created decremented reference destroyed
When count reach zero object memory reclaimed
As manual memory management unlike tracing garbage collection reference counting guarantee object destroyed soon last reference destroyed usually access memory either CPU cache object freed directly pointed thus tends significant negative side effect CPU cache virtual memory operation
There number disadvantage reference counting generally solved mitigated sophisticated algorithm used convert thus reducing amount work needed done garbage collector
This done using analysis determine whether object allocated within function accessible outside
escape function thread
In case object may allocated directly thread stack released function return reducing potential garbage collection overhead
Generally speaking likely garbage collection standard feature
In language built garbage collection added library C
Most garbage collection built
especially notable first first language introduce garbage collection
Other dynamic language version use reference counting also tend use GC
language usually provide integrated garbage collection
Notable exception
Historically language intended beginner often used garbage collection data type string list burden programmer manual memory management
On early microcomputer limited memory slow processor BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random inexplicable pause midst program operation
Some BASIC interpreter Apple II family repeatedly scanned string descriptor string highest address order compact toward high memory resulting performance could introduce pause execution program
A replacement garbage collector Applesoft BASIC published January page identified group string every pas heap cut collection time dramatically
released provided windowing garbage collector BASIC reduced collection fraction second
While traditionally garbage collection release introduced garbage collection using developed runtime collector
However release garbage collection deprecated favor ARC introduced
Furthermore since May Apple even forbids usage garbage collection new OS X application
For garbage collection never introduced due problem application responsivity performance instead iOS us ARC
Garbage collection rarely used system perceived need tight control use limited resource
However garbage collector compatible limited environment developed
The Microsoft embedded software platform like larger cousin include garbage collection
form allowing memory reused reclaimed based invariant known compilation
This form garbage collection studied saw greater usage introduction ARC Apple ecosystem iOS OS X
Incremental concurrent garbage collector developed algorithm algorithm
In Baker algorithm allocation done either half single region memory
When becomes half full garbage collection performed move live object half remaining object implicitly deallocated
The running program check object reference correct half move across background task finding object
scheme based empirical observation object die young
In generational garbage collection two allocation region generation kept kept separate based object age
New object created young generation regularly collected generation full object still referenced older region copied next oldest generation
Occasionally full scan performed
Some include hardware support garbage collection
Most implementation garbage collector
Such garbage collector meet constraint used operating system

According Leon UNIX operating system OS software manages hardware software resource computer
UNIX first developed constant development ever since
UNIX one widely used operating system industry government education
It stable system server desktop laptop
Memory important resource computer
Memory management process managing computer memory consists primary memory secondary memory
The goal memory management keep track part memory use part use allocate memory process need done
UNIX memory management scheme includes swapping demand paging
The simplest form memory management splitting main memory multiple logical space called partition
Each partition used separate program
There type memory partitioning Single partition allocation separate main memory operating system one user process area
Operating system able virtual memory using single partition
Using single partition ineffective allows one process run memory one time
C Figure Single Partitioning Most operating system nowadays using multiple partition flexible
Multiple partition allocation enabled multiple program run main memory
Each partition used one process
There two different form multiple partition allocation fixed partitioning variable partitioning
Fixed partitioning divide memory many fixed partition change
However variable partitioning flexible partition vary dynamically later process come go
Variable partitioning Variable memory used UNIX
C variable Figure Fixed Partitioning Variable Partitioning Program place memory execution
However large program divide small piece loading piece needed
Overlays replace new piece program unused
UNIX using technique run new program fork running process also known
The overlay technique illustrated
C Figure Overlay Process Swapping consists bringing process physical memory entirely running
When process longer use process terminated swapped disk
The procedure swapping illustrated figure
C Figure Swapping Initially process A memory
Then process B swapped memory disk
After process A terminates swapped disk
Then process C swapped free space
The size process different therefore process swapped multiple hole memory UNIX using variable partitioning
C Figure External Fragmentation There two technique solve problem memory compaction fit process using algorithm Compaction C Figure Compaction Memory compaction move process upward far possible free memory placed one large block
However good idea requires lot CPU time
Most process grow run process data segment grow many programming language process grow
If hole next process allocated process allowed grow hole
Therefore good allocate extra memory whenever process swapped
Figure Allocating Space Growing Data Extracted http April Algorithms There three different type algorithm used load program wherever memory space unused first fit best fit worst fit
Algorithms Descriptions First Fit The memory manager scan along list allocates first space fit process
First fit fast algorithm search little possible
Best Fit The memory manager scan whole list take smallest hole fit process
Best fit slower first fit must search whole list every time called
Worst Fit The memory manager scan whole list take largest available hole hole broken big enough useful
UNIX operating system allows user fully utilize physical memory installed system well part hard disk called swap space designated use kernel physical memory insufficient handle task
Virtual memory manager create virtual address space secondary memory hard disk determine part address space loaded physical memory given time
The benefit virtual memory relies separation logical physical memory
C Figure Logical Memory Physical Memory Paging memory allocation strategy transferring unit virtual address space called virtual page whenever page needed execute program
As size frame page logical page placed physical frame memory
Every process logical divided allocate virtual address space
There page table virtual memory allocate keep tracking page map frame
C Figure The relation virtual address physical memory address given page table UNIX perform page swapping program need certain page
This procedure called demand paging
The page paged memory needed execute
The whole process paged memory page needed swapped
Demand paging decrease paging time physical memory needed needed page paged reading time unused page avoided
C Figure Demand paging As example figure page needed Process A
Therefore page paged memory
A page fault occurs program try use page memory due demand paging paged page memory needed
For example figure program try use Page Process A memory operating system interrupt occurs result trying access missing page Page paged memory
C Fault Figure Page Fault Handling Retrieved Slides Material Chapter slide The diagram illustrated step handling page fault
When page fault occurs program execution kernel first locate missing page backing store disk
After located page find free memory frame physical memory copy
The page table reset instruction restart
When frame memory used problem occurs
This cause page unable paged memory
Solution free frame problem find memory frame idle free frame using page replacement algorithm
There three common type page replacement algorithm First First FIFO Optimal Least Recently Used LRU
UNIX using least recently used algorithm page replacement
The least recently used algorithm replaces page used longest time assumption page needed
The page table record every time page referenced page replacement needed every page checked find oldest recorded time
Every operating system different memory management
UNIX also exclusive memory management strategy manage memory resource optimally
UNIX using multiple variable partitioning memory stored use flexible
UNIX us overlay swapping replace unused program
However facing external fragmentation problem solve loading program memory using best fit algorithm
Besides UNIX also fully utilized virtual memory physical memory swap space using demand paging
It allows user store physical memory hard disk RAM memory always insufficient
UNIX owns private memory space called Kernel memory
Kernel us RAM keep memory resident ensure user program overwrite corrupt kernel data structure
Strong memory protection implemented kernel memory management keep user corrupting system area
C Figure Kernel memory Fork function used duplicate process
The newly created process called Child original process called Parent
Bringing process physical memory entirely running
Only needed page execute program swapped
Not using Virtual Memory
Use advantage Virtual Memory
Process size must equal le main memory
Process size greater main memory
Less flexible handling memory
More flexible handling memory

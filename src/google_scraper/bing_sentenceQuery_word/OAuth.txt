What exactly OAuth Open Authorization
I gleaned information But I want learn know
I looking info lifecycle
Why social network rely open protocol
Will become de facto near future various technology

What exactly OAuth Open Authorization
OAuth allows notifying
Facebook
grant permission
Facebook Application access
list friend
If read stated plainly I would understand confusion
So let go concrete example joining yet another social network
Say existing GMail account
You decide join LinkedIn
Adding friend manually tiresome
You might get fed insert typo address invitation
So might tempted create account
Facing situation LinkedIn Good Idea TM write program add list friend automatically computer far efficient effective tiresome error prone task
Since joining network easy would refuse offer would
Without API exchanging list contact would give LinkedIn username password GMail account thereby
This OAuth come
If GMail support OAuth protocol LinkedIn ask authorize access GMail list contact
OAuth allows Will become de facto standard
near future
Well although OAuth significant step forward solve problem people use correctly
For instance resource provider give single access level resource provide mechanism managing access point
In word OAuth framework provide authorization functionality authentication
In practice fit social network model well
It especially popular social network want allow plugins
This area access resource inherently necessary also inherently unreliable
little quality control application
I seen many us wild
I mean I know online financial advice firm access bank record automatically although technically used way
What oAuth
OAuth simply secure authorization protocol deal authorization third party application access user data without exposing password
eg
Login fb gPlus twitter many work protocol
Parties involved The Protocol becomes easier know involved party
Basically three party involved oAuth Provider oAuth Client Owner
How It Works
I supposed scenario website stackoverflow need add login facebook feature
Thus facebook oAuth Provider stackoverflow oAuth Client

At beginning facebook oAuth Provider idea stackoverflow oAuth Client link
So first step register stackoverflow facebook
This done manually developer need give app information facebook like app name website logo redirect Url important one
Then stackoverflow successfully registered got client Id client secret etc facebook running

Stackoverflow request facebook ClientId fb use recognize client redirectUrl fb return back url success user get redirected facebook login page
This best part For More Simply put OAuth way application gain credential information without directly getting user login information website
For example write application website want use data user facebook account use OAuth get token via callback url use token make call facebook API get use data token expires
Websites rely allows programmer access data without user directly disclose information spread credential around online still provide level protection data
Will become de facto method authorization
Perhaps gaining lot support recently Twitter Facebook like programmer want build application around user data
Oauth definitely gaining momentum becoming popular among enterprise APIs well
In app data driven world Enterprises exposing APIs outer world line Google Facebook twitter
With development way triangle authentication get formed API Any enterprise expose asset API say Amazon Target etc Developer The one build apps APIs The end The end user service provided say user Amazon Now develops situation related security I listing complexity You end user want allow developer access APIs behalf
The API provider authenticate developer end user The end user able grant revoke permission consent given The developer varying level trust API provider level permission given different The Oauth authorization framework try solve mentioned problem standard way
With prominence APIs Apps problem become relevant standard try solve ouath something care API even end user
happened sign SO account Google button
Source OAuth open standard authorization commonly used way Internet user log third party website using Microsoft Google Facebook Twitter account without exposing password

OAuth authorization protocol word set rule allows website application access user data without user needing share login credential
OAuth protocol enables user share data resource stored one site another site secure authorization scheme based authorization mechanism
OAuth also known OAuth Core
It important realize OAuth way authenticate user ensure user say
The protocol designed circumvent problem sharing user credential distributed Web environment
With OAuth resource stored one website shared accessed user authenticated via OAuth
There need user create new account website time website privy user credential
OAuth operates much like computing model primary website storing user resource act server website application accessing data client
The primary website establishes OAuth interface otherwise called API secret key requesting website mean establishing session validate user
Once user request access data resource client website take side trip forwarded login procedure primary website time user provides login credential
Upon successful authentication authorization token sent primary website requesting website acknowledgment authentication allowing user access data resource originally requested

OAuth open authorization standard used provide secure client application access resource
The OAuth authorization framework enables application obtain limited access service either behalf resource owner allowing application obtain access behalf
OAuth enables server owner authorize access server resource without sharing credential
This mean user grant access private resource one server another server resource without sharing identity
OAuth designed problem limitation found traditional authentication model application required store resource owner credential future use resource owner revoke access individual third party without revoking access third party
OAuth address issue introducing authorization layer separating role client resource owner
Instead using resource owner credential access protected resource client obtains access token issued client authorization server approval resource owner
The OAuth protocol published informational document result small ad hoc community effort
The OAuth protocol backward compatible OAuth
In May security flaw discovered widely used OAuth OpenID website authentication mechanism
The flaw OAuth result business implemented standard primary situation open redirects used
Following news security flaw Google said stringent securing user log account applying additional authorization check

I developing iGoogle Gadget
I access spreadsheet data logged user
How I implement OAuth
OAuth API Google give developer let authenticate Google account manner going example programmatic way
Authentication basis OAuth able retrieve lot information specific Google account calendar info contact etc
To implement would need read website You become OAuth Consumer Google service OAuth provider case
There lot open source implementation protocol various I would suggest read want implement clearly written long
The official site good read link Basically protocol exchange little bit data application aka consumer provider user internal HTTP request provider exchanging token redirects user browser provider
Also consumer store token data regarding interaction
It complicated time interesting thing implement

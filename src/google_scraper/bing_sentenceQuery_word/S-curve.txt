Have ever wanted quickly look project report see project history current status projected status
Well
You see project planned performance actual performance determine desired targeted performance quick glance
An project management tool track progress time allows quick visual determine project status
As project continues grows graph turn historical representation allow quick comparison actual data
generated using versus
I say could cost planned labor actual labor number document delivered list go
The item common least project management time
For example looking I decided use project cost cost cumulative time
As see beginning project cost low
As resource added project execution rise cumulative cost
Towards end project cost tend level spending decrease resource released
In example actual labor cost compared planned labor cost
For example project spending le actual labor cost planned
If project completed end date project spent considerably le labor planned
This good project especially cost overrun material
When project manager reviewer look comparison interpret data presented
This data interpreted determine project budget cost target
Let look project cost budget
In example looking project complete see actual project cost le budget entire project
This shown seeing actual cost planned cost
Let look project cost budget
In example project also complete
This example different actual end planned cost
This project budget good place project manager
As see actual project cost began exceed planned cost
The project team would review occurred date determine actual cost exceeded planned cost
Now let look determine project growth slippage
The example show actual man hour finished right planned man hour
Since actual planned considered
If actual difference would considered

The winding road business often follows S curve
Comstock Images The S curve mathematical model also known logistic curve describes growth one variable term another variable time
S curve found field biology physic business technology
In business S curve used describe sometimes predict performance company product period time
Systems whether business embryology follow S curve distinctive shape flattened S although slope steep mountain plateau summit probably accurate description
S curve start modest shallow growth described mathematical term lower asymptote
Then growth accelerates rapidly slope arch upwards reach maximum growth
This point maximum growth point inflexion
After point inflexion growth taper mature little growth
This mature stage S curve called upper asymptote
Businesses product business follow S curve characterized shallow start early adopter niche market buy product invest company
Then experience rapid growth product business dominant position market
After rapid growth business maintain high performance level little growth often signal mature saturated market
Technology business computer software electronic manufacturer often display S curve life cycle
One explanation initial progress slow principle technology poorly understood
Once researcher get better understanding technology progress accelerates rapidly
However time go effort required improve technology reach level increase slows growth curve flattens
Businesses technology well documented S curve growth cycle include automobile semiconductor steam engine disk drive
It may seem surprising variety phenomenon field growth size cow performance hard disk manufacturer follow similar growth curve
The reason constrained kind limiting factor
For instance population living organism limited carrying capacity environment business growth limited demand market financial viability product sell

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

word meaning futility uselessness wastefulness key concept like TPS one three type deviation optimal allocation resource others
effective way increase profitability
From point view work activity produce good provides service customer willing pay constraint impediment cause waste occur
There two type muda One key step lean process TPS identify activity add value progressively work improve eliminate
Originally seven form waste identified whereas recently eighth added
These often remembered using mnemonic TIM WOODS
Every time product touched moved unnecessarily risk could damaged lost delayed etc
well cost added value
Transportation add value product
transformation consumer willing pay
Whether form raw material WIP finished good represents capital outlay yet produce income
The longer product sits one state contributes waste
The smooth continuous flow work process ensures excess amount inventory minimized
In contrast transportation refers damage transaction cost associated moving product motion refers damage cost inflicted creates product
This include equipment worker unnecessary downtime
Whenever product transportation processed waiting typically queue
In traditional process large part individual product life spent waiting worked
Doing product required result taking longer costing produce
This also includes using component precise complex expensive higher quality absolutely required
Making product required result several form waste typically caused production large batch
The customer need often change time take produce larger batch
Having discard rework product due earlier defective work component result additional cost delay
Organizations often skill worker permit worker operate silo knowledge shared
This added original seven form waste resolving waste key enabler resolving others
The original eight form waste developed Toyota specific process
Companies identified internal form waste Any unsafe work condition leading future value reducing incident General uncertainty right thing divide process related activity Process Operation
He distinguishes Process course material transformed product Operation action performed material worker machine
This distinction generally recognized people would view Operations performed raw material product worker machine Process raw material transformed final product
He make distinction value added product process operation
He state whereas many see Process Operations parallel see right angle orthogonal see
This starkly throw operation waste category
Many technique work similar way
By planning reduce manpower reduce time reduce campaign length reduce lot size question waste come immediately focus upon element prevent plan implemented
Often operation area rather process area muda eliminated remove blockage plan
Tools many type methodology employed waste reduce eliminate
The plan therefore build fast flexible process immediate impact reduce waste therefore cost
By ratcheting process towards aim focused muda reduction achieve step improvement become required process function
Without intent build fast flexible process significant danger improvement achieved sustained desirable slip back towards old behaviour without process stopping

Thanks lot always comment opinion
In case point There Japanese word muda mean scrap
In Job I performing project decrease service time time car wait served mechanic This shop repairing car
In project I mechanic person Master Technician
This master technician supervise work done mechanic perform diagnosis analysis
This mean move area car
I discussed anothe person told time Master Technician move one car another car muda said kind muda This new matter trasportation one
I response saying If Master Technician move one car another car muda since go check repair car
The issue The Master Technician go one car another car give VALUE job
Of course If Master Technician repairing area nothing I agree MUDA
I use meaning MUDA Waste add extra cost product rather adding value
In opinion I sure muda
What think
If I making mistake please let know
Thanks Jose Ramon It Muda work walking
That said Muda avoidable
There several thing often mentioned general discusison waste muda
While seven form waste truly added many many example Muda indeed waste required
Management example company fit definition
In example movement Chief Mechanic called required waste
And like government regulated issue thing must live
In opinion muda classified term BNVA Business Added
Sometimes muda may reduced often entirely eliminated due structure business OSHA regulatory type customer
Sorry Ron Lone wrong Brandon right
Transport waste required waste
Just pure waste mean get rid
But thinking box Chief able sit computer diagnose every car data would eliminated transport waste
The diagnostic step transport
It required transport like required meet government regs
This clearly transport waste since Master Tech would still move one vehicle
Why train tech autnomous maintenance perform skill Master Tech
Another waste might creep rework Master Tech might still rework completely done tech
Third waste might also happen waste waiting tech lack skill Master Tech thus allows vehicle wait maintenance coming Master Tech vehicle Required waste waste I stated
Some waste totally eliminated
Another term used required added stated
Everything black white try claim
Also classifying waste require meet three friteria value added The customer internal external willing pay It done right first time It somehow change thing going process
So case situation customer willing pay extra proper diagnosis avoids nuisance return visit customer change way go process
You could build case value I last part Ron
Still got ta ask go correctly first time every time
You building case cost avoidance value right
Ron This assumes mechanic proper diagnosis
So case situation customer willing pay extra proper diagnosis avoids nuisance return visit customer change way go process
You could build case value Why skill set across mechanic use Master Mechanic analyze multiple trip customer identify possible design problem nobody aware deficiency mechanic analysis skill
People spend lot time trying figure catagories stck thing
It thing enhance improvement
Actually creates waste spend time classification meet criterion specified post
Actually Lean Six Sigma project come catagory waste criterion
Why feel compelled use word muda
Just opinion
The question using word Muda gone
My apology
Jose Ramon Why feel compelled use word Muda
Agree J The inability technician right thing first diagnosis require Master Tech supervise work waste I never heard term required waste current system make waste unavoidable
And yes cost
May I categorize COPQ
If I may conclude Master Technician waste
Because underutilize supervise checking
It better could ask train technician ask establish fool proof system diagnosis thing As detailed previous responder always eliminate waste system either due poor performance ofthe system required inspection case government regulation may perfomr task required
Transportation freight handler custom station would example required waste
In real workd must quantify reality situation move away written text book
I shocked hear hear required waste
In case given example let take case individual diagnostics save employer customer great deal time implied would remove function even detrimental operation
I think Would good idea improve technician thepoint could perfomr samelevel asthe ideally yes practically may possible
Dang Mike
You stole
Muda Poka Yoke Gemba All could explained much easier native tongue
In case southern Canadian
It merely way elevate
But I feel way sigma level
Stevo Stevo Do Southern Canadians sound like Southern folk Southeast Texas
I traveling Saskatoon SK soon I worried think I talked Jeff I sure Saskatoon Mother Ontario part Canada would Do Southern Canadians sound like Southern folk Southeast Texas eh If southeast Texas considered one talking funny
The great part Canadians polite rarely say thing speak
Good luck
Travel safe
Mike Thanks clarification
My coworkers Saskatoon seem able comprehend Southern English fairly well
I one young lady however say difficulty following along I start talking aboot technical With Southern I Canadian O still able communicate effectively
I amateur linguist I like hearing various accent dialect matter language Stevo Do anyhow
The whole thing make sense
The point speaking writing communicate
Instead worrying delivering clear message seem find important throw word stand chance confuse general public create clarity
That mean use word motivation would
I would suppose prevalant use Japanese word current substitute buzzword used throw around make sure everyone understood
Style substance
Rant away
It always lead somewhere interesting
What part southern Canada
The matrilineal side family Wallaceburg Ontario
It always seemed odd refered part Ontario Banana Belt Canada
There way banana tree would survive
Regards Jeff I trouble getting translator Chile
They struggled Texas accent
They finally advertised someone could translate Texan Spanish found guy lived Texas
Things get really screwed I try speak Spanish Texas accent
Regards Noted Ron
I think matter term
The definition MUDA human activity absorbs resource create value job convert muda value creating better way work simply destroying operation name efficiency
That convenience required waste term
For waste waste currently waste improve operator level performance good idea reality may difficult possible
If willing travel Indonesia surf Bali Dive Bunaken please take opportunity come Jakarta visit TMMIN see operator speed assembly car Toyota Kijang every minute takt time zero defect almost equal making Mint mocha chip frappuccino starbuck
Or please come AHM motorcycle Honda Supra exit assembly line every second faster drink mocha point text book written based reality call science fiction book

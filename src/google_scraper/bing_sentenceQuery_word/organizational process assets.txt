The dictionary suggests asset In commercial enterprise asset purchased increase value organization generate future cash flow
Having bought invested organization clearly need ensure use asset effectively possible order supply good service customer require make return asset expected
Once start think organizational asset investment upon need get reasonable return every leader thinking use asset disposal effectively
In practical term usually mean thinking every job done individually
Each job task performed different course
It different way organization structured way work divided people team
It also different people work organization varied contribution make range skill knowledge may work different way
That asset given team need think order perform job task project vary
Managers many level enterprise make decision asset acquired used disposed sometimes sometimes help people professional team purchasing contract legal finance
Acquired mean bought hired case employee recruited
Disposed mean throw away sell get rid way
The important thing team leader remember asset therefore whether people equipment premise cost money
They cost money acquire maintain even dispose much care attention need given
The cost acquiring asset includes wage price resource
It also includes time spent deciding recruit equipment buy
Some organization high turnover staff
This mean people leave job frequently
It may cost organization large amount money simply getting enough people keep organization going
In addition equipment need regular servicing maintenance computer often need upgrading even people need maintained trained skill updated
In fact cost training staff using new computer software often far cost buying first place
Even physical asset bought capital item long term cost life
Premises need maintained left alone factory office warehouse shop front start deteriorate quickly
It also cost money clean redecorate repair building
In modern world increasingly stringent environmental regulation also make expensive organization get rid waste product encouraged case incented clean operation recycle material possible reduce carbon In summary today organization large small sector industry choice manage asset carefully entire life acquisition final disposal

submitted I going sophomore community college year I transferring university Pittsburgh
Right major undecided I strongly considering marketing major
Once I transfer pitt marketing major computer science minor good idea
What type job could I get
If good idea I minor
Post comment
Get degree like
Minors mean nothing usually give enough knowledge skilled field
HBR recently commented CMOs larger IT budget CIOs company
Marketing increasingly field online marketing grows exponentially compared channel technical solution manage use information gathered
These day larger company running automated marketing system need quite bit database juggling data filtering exporting synchronization etc
said CS minor wo really help much area time done college system integrated point wo really need advanced computer skill manage
If ask good supplement marketing would I focus spin international study
Few company work one market day marketing job often include speaking engagement show partner channel management
If American might benefit insight work
HBR recently commented CMOs larger IT budget CIOs company
Marketing increasingly field online marketing grows exponentially compared channel technical solution manage use information gathered
That good point
I natural interest technology marketing
What I seeing exactly playing money marketing le hardware traditional IT like telephony
Salesforce recently bought ExactTarget marketing automation platform provider
They paid billion company generates million annual revenue
That solid hint industry going prevalent technical solution going marketing soon
The day marketing art full feeling opinion gone
Today marketing database market segmentation tracking analytics testing kind statistical analysis
Some job marketing analytics day read like old accounting job asking primarily mathematical statistical modelling regression analysis skill

Agreed
If want earn major comp sci minor marketing
I agree earning
As recently graduated marketing major I find I learned marketing class I remember use
A lot curriculum practice
Now I left wishing I hard skill field comp sci I may go grab AA web something
I got associate video game scripting bachelor business management elective marketing like consumer behavior working quite well unique
That bit assumption care explain
I sure average salary developer average salary marketer look trend growth
Marketing avg starting salary college marketing major Average salary Comp Sci major college Average Salary IT major college Salary Marketing Salary Comp Sci Salary IT Science CS avg starting Salary avg salary Systems IS avg starting Salary avg salary Information Systems CIS avg starting Salary avg salary Technology IT avg starting Salary avg salary avg starting Salary avg mid career Salary Communications avg starting salary avg salary Granted I grabbed stats online minute tend appears
The point industry average marketing field filled worker company sort patch marketing operation spam call center similar operation
You find bottom rank marketing department many company staffed people significant marketing skill qualification
On hand ca really programmer programming skill
These job stacked people qualification even low end spectrum
So keeping mind marketing professional studied profession solid paid comparably comp sci people
Also worth noting marketing professional higher career glass ceiling
Development go far marketing professional drive experience get better access position purely marketing put touch strategic planning issue technical operation
It well could I entirely sure stats
However ca really argue growth comp
sci related field
As I noted I quickly looked online
As I agree glass ceiling higher look new enormous IPO type company startup looking exit people tech guy one way another
So low ceiling say Twitter Fab
In end course make money field exceptional field
I bullish programming developer near future
Note I one Its also worth noting two really mutually exclusive marketer developer vice versa granted normally think two together CRM big data engine well field really coming
Agreed development marketing much similar seems
In field people capable lateral thinking creative problem solving highly sought
The idea developer linear code crunchers anyone favour mostly propagated people never bothered understand development
As glass ceiling take
Most tech startup founded developer short hiring people one break profitability acquisition potential one developer
It feature spec sell fact address tangible market done good job communicating value
Also marketing go digital basic HTML CSS even scripting becoming important old skillsets copywriting speaking design
In last year I chug countless line HTMLs CSS slap together simple Python VBscript work database etc
I figure company marketing department bigger people specialist generalist
And today generalist surrounded hipster ascot database analytics multivariate testing UX statistical forecasting
Totally agree savvy investor going acquire startup proof concept minimum
And sort rare see business savvy developer though I think change significantly near future simply due possible paycheck field
I say I think historically development related field attracted people drawn certainty working computer
What I mean write code correctly going work remind accountant way
Marketing least topically seems interesting volatile many way draw different market people pardon pun
As I noted though I think may change development continues evolution
And yes person must laterally communicative problem I faced developer past much moreso socially inclined profession able effectively integrate one discipline truly sought marketplace reason
I mean many great developer simply know market useful code many great developer know market appealing wide market code
As anything else cream rise top
And spot last paragraph fact I think even anything exceptionally many field day quickly learn next thing technology progressing exponentially seem slowing
academic never business made profit
As person two degree previously worked university year founded company since leaving public sector I aprove question
Most academic ever academia since age
Internet marketing ad exchange etc Also consider stats minor CS elective
Taking relational database class learning SQL league ahead others getting market research database marketing email campaign clickstream data SEO
However actually analyzing campaign attributing ROI looking like marketing bos involve heavy stats work
Minor CS skill stats knowledge marketing skill going game changing skill set marketing manager
Marketing major comp sci minor starting salary anywhere
So yes
That combo I would done I go back time fewyears I could live true As noted reverse two may better financially however want love
Because hard something hate good enough one best
You interested freelance work
I comp sci major marketing background could use help project
PM contact detail
Not sure help think
I graduated Sales International Business
Always wanted Pharmaceutical Sales long story short somehow ended getting job local computer chain started location
I hired computer technician assistant
I literally idea hard drive first day look manager face saw I notebook write thing I could remember IDE cable go simply priceless
Fast forward year I one head tech business
Had year laptop repair Mac technician company tech
I manage business location
The money great kinda working Scrooge one rewarding job I could imagine
I think tend ask question many time ask passionated really make u happy
I think ask would motivate get bed every morning get excited think work
External factor always factor effect passionated eventually make good regardless major
So I say follow passion tell
Focus dream passion bring good thing come way
Honestly I suggest switching degree
CS major marketing minor
Especially interested digital marketing marketing
I honestly feel though marketing degree restricts creativity creating campaign benefit teach manage full team working marketing campaign something learn time come anyhow
However follow one single piece advice
Do whichever whatever make happy
College suck enjoying
Online advertising tech product management field worth considering
Online advertising particular good number job astronomical growth rate
In either case technical knowledge leg colleague enter field pick technical side fly
Minors mean little
Computer science Marketing strange mix
If want analytical discipline complement marketing statistic obvious smart choice
It would valuable major CS minor marketing
Source I Pittsburgh going back school CS MKTG degree PSU
PM want chat I could probably help lot

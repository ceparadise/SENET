Scientists study nature work engineer computer programmer create new thing machine program technique
Because engineer computer programmer different objective scientist follow different process work
This guide describe engineering process detail highlight applied science fair project many area engineering computer science
Note If engineering programming project still important read material project
It contains lot important information repeat document
One important concept come engineering process called
Iteration procedure repeat sequence step time coming closer goal
While would nice everything perfect design actually pretty good reason iteration norm
We iterating description engineering process see ca even describe process without iterating end document good understanding iteration normal fact desirable part engineering design
Let look engineering process detail In real life distinction science engineering always clear
Scientists often engineering work engineer frequently apply scientific principle including scientific method
Much often call computer science actually engineering programmer creating new product
Your project may fall gray area science engineering OK
Many project use scientific method
However objective project invent new device procedure computer program algorithm may make sense follow engineering process
Below highlight thing would differently step assignment completing science fair project follow engineering process
Most science fair accept engineering project completed using engineering process
Some even encourage
However doubt check fair follow engineering process instead scientific method
Instead stating question engineer state customer need
What think customer want
Later opportunity refine believe customer need specify design criterion
If follow engineering process bibliography project need ask additional question background research plan
In addition understanding science invention work also need Now let look generate actual research question
Generate keyword list way described page entitled
These example question help understand science needed design
After clarify definition target user want ask question like Then ask question help understand product program fill similar need need identified All question seem fairly straightforward
Now thing get little trickier start thinking possible design criterion research
Anything measured perceived sens design criterion invention possibility truly limitless
Limitless
That probably reminds bad dream teacher asking write paper tomorrow morning
But panic
Only handful potential design criterion likely important project trick deciding one
A good place start need statement
In need statement probably called need either specifies least suggests design criterion
For example want design bat strength size aluminum bat half weight likely research question would You probably want part research plan part research iterate
Understanding science customer need product program fill similar need give idea design criterion research
Nonetheless help brainstorm several list possible design criterion
It would rare one important would equally rare still possible none
Every product area criterion example For project engineering programming follow step complete background research plan For engineering programming project Review Literature include What design tradeoff
Sometimes design criterion fight tend move opposite direction
For example material make baseball bat lighter weight probably expensive lighter
You ca lowest weight lowest cost time therefore design bat make tradeoff cost weight
Design tradeoff common
Almost every project
As mentioned beginning engineering project least one involving invention new product program really variable hypothesis instead next step establish design criterion
We already discussed design criterion couple time must iterating
Yup
Hopefully much better understanding important design criterion successfully meet need called question
How many criterion
That really good question without good answer
You neither many
Oh big help
The reality experience important deciding many design criterion important
It another good time ask mentor parent teacher advice asking specific question
Tell design criterion considering ask one might able without
Here thought help
If many design criterion become difficult actually design build product
Imagine friend whose parent set ten time many rule parent
Wow scary thought
Such imaginary friend might difficulty thing would always violating one rule
Having many design criterion criterion type rule creates similar situation
With many criterion design tradeoff increase many design decision become unnecessarily complex
What many depends product
An airliner might thousand design criterion could right
For project time complete science fair two three maybe five design criterion appropriate
Why might design criterion problem
If criterion might get result really want
Let say built lightweight baseball bat cost prototype
When parent get bill would experience bad result
The baseball bat least one criterion one cost
So slacker design criterion
By way professional engineer call design many criterion many rule one criterion rule
Engineering project material list programming project probably
While engineering programming project procedure make sense prepare preliminary design stage process
You might asking need design let alone need iterate design
Iterate schmiterate might think got head
You would first person feel way
In book wrote founder Science Buddies said building thing youth Being extremely impatient I hated draw plan I started building took much time
My dad excellent draftsman always drew sketch building anything
He tried teach instead I liked visualize everything head hammer away
As thing I built became complex lack adequate plan became troublesome
I remember I first tried telescope mount I building
As I swung around polar axis clanged another part mount I rebuild I could look whole sky
Eventually I learned father trying teach important plan Hess
Rarely first design best often wo even work
Iterate good plan
And case obvious need put design paper type computer
You see thing would see head able refer back plan remember detail would otherwise forget
Written printed design plan also let share idea get feedback people
When others conducting experiment Investigators engineering programming project building testing prototype best design
Make sure involve targeted user testing
It vital get feedback design
When engineer programmer test retest creation data analysis
For example might measure performance improvement creation
So even though call step Redesign Retest usually involves data analysis like project using scientific method
Almost always want present result testing retesting graph

The methodical series step engineer use creating functional product process
The process highly part process often need repeated many time another entered though part get iterated number cycle given project may vary
process often iterative basic science mathematics engineering science applied convert resource optimally meet stated objective
Among fundamental element establishment objective criterion synthesis analysis construction testing evaluation
The step tend get articulated subdivided illustrated different way generally reflect certain core principle regarding underlying concept respective sequence interrelationship
One framing engineering design process delineates following stage
Others noting different author research literature textbook define different phase design process varying activity occurring within suggested model
A standard summary process European engineering design literature
In example key aspect concept evaluation prototyping subset extension one listed step
It also important understand well articulation process different terminology employed may varying degree overlap affect step get stated explicitly deemed high level versus subordinate given model
Various stage design process even earlier involve significant amount time spent locating information
Consideration given existing applicable literature problem success associated existing solution cost marketplace need
The source information relevant including existing solution
effective technique solution available market
Other source information include Internet local available government document personal organization vendor catalog individual available
Establishing design conducting sometimes termed deemed related activity one important element design process task often performed time feasibility analysis
The design requirement control design product process developed throughout engineering design process
These include basic thing like function attribute determined assessing user need
Some design requirement include hardware software parameter
In case carried schedule resource plan estimate next phase developed
The feasibility study evaluation analysis potential proposed project support process
It outline analysis alternative method achieving desired outcome
The feasibility study help narrow scope project identify best scenario
A feasibility report generated following Post Feasibility Review performed
The purpose feasibility assessment determine whether engineer project proceed
This based two criterion project need based achievable idea need within
It important engineer experience good judgment involved portion feasibility study
A concept study often phase project planning includes producing idea taking account pro con implementing idea
This stage project done minimize likelihood error manage cost evaluate potential success intended project
In event engineering issue problem defined potential solution must identified
These solution found using mental process idea generated
In fact step often termed Concept Generation
The following widely used technique Various generated idea must undergo step utilizes various tool compare contrast relative strength weakness possible alternative
The preliminary design design includes also called often bridge gap design conception detailed design particularly case level conceptualization achieved ideation sufficient full evaluation
So task overall system configuration defined project may provide early project configuration
This notably varies lot field industry product
During detailed design optimization parameter part created change preliminary design focus creating general framework build project
Blanchard Fabrycky describe The whats initiating conceptual design produce hows conceptual design evaluation effort applied feasible conceptual design concept
Next hows taken preliminary design mean allocated requirement
There become whats drive preliminary design address hows lower Following FEED Detailed Design Detailed Engineering phase may consist material well
This phase elaborates aspect complete description well
DFM general engineering art designing product way easy manufacture
CAD program made detailed design phase efficient
For example CAD program provide reduce volume without hindering part quality
It also calculate using determine stress throughout part
The tool design consists planning product tool used process
Tasks complete step include selecting material selection production process determination sequence operation selection tool jig fixture metal cutting metal plastic forming tool
This task also involves additional iteration ensure version meet standard
The engineering design process bear similarity
Both process begin existing knowledge gradually become specific search case pure basic science case applied science engineering
The key difference engineering process scientific process engineering process focus scientific process emphasizes

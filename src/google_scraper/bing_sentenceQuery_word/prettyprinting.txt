Pretty Printer code beautifier provided source code SAP ABAP program
The source code ABAP although stored database manner ABABP Editor standardized automatically
Pretty Printer help standardize layout program
The functionality provided Pretty Printer help arranging associated keywords group indent programming statement meet guideline readability according ABAP user guide
Some prominent feature Pretty Printer SAP ABAP Insertion proper appropriate comment block statement containing FORM MODULE
The functionality also automatically pick routine name parameter used statement automatically fill comment block
Pretty Printer never separate break loop control processing block written single line
It also avoids separating statement keyword WHEN statement statement
Pretty Printer left justifies remark comment provided command line
This done number character statement character fewer
It help bringing standard format source code layout
Pretty Printer assigns certain keywords like EVENT CONTROL INCLUDE separate line
It provides indentation command line controlling structure event margin two space
It help locating command go beyond one line also help placing preceding command new line
Pretty Printer also unites statement logically belong together
This done indenting statement block
To invoke pretty printer functionality go transaction select Pretty Printer

application various stylistic convention similar kind content
These formatting convention adjust positioning spacing add color contrast adjust size make similar modification intended make content easier people view read understand
Prettyprinters programming language source code sometimes called code beautifiers
usually refers displaying similar way would professionally
For example system may write output like Some MathPrint OSes perform
Additionally number newer scientific calculator equipped dot matrix screen capable Casio series Natural Display WriteView HP SmartCalc
Many text formatting program also typeset mathematics developed specifically mathematical
markup language instance typically associated tag string content visually determine hierarchy nesting
Although syntactical structure tag based language significantly vary indentation may vary significantly due markup language interpreted reflect data describe
In reflect data meaning syntax required syntax
In whitespace character tag considered text parsed text node parsed result
While indentation may generously applied MathML document sufficient additional care must taken prettyprinting HTML document ensure additional text node created destroyed general proximity content tag element
This difference complexity perspective automated operation special rule edge case necessary simple MathML example
The HTML example may require series progressive interrelated algorithm account various pattern tag element content conforms uniform style consistent application across various instance evidenced application component used beautify HTML XML related technology tool
Programmers often use tool format particular manner
Proper code formatting make easier read understand
Different programmer often prefer different style formatting use code whitespace positioning
A code formatter convert source code one format style another
This relatively straightforward unambiguous syntax programming language
Code beautification involves parsing source code component structure assignment statement block etc
see also formatting manner specified user configuration file
Code beautifiers exist standalone application built
For example various language mode correctly block code attractively
An early example GRINDEF function program used pruning format program
Early version operated executable list structure form Lisp program oblivious special meaning various function
Later version special read convention incorporating comment also preserving unexpanded form
They also allowed special indentation convention special function
The term grind used Lisp circle synonym
Many open source project established rule code layout
The typical
The biggest difference two location brace GNU style opening closing brace line indent
BSD style place opening brace end preceding line closing brace followed
The size indent location whitespace also differs
The following example show typical C structure various rule format
Without formatting look like The produce following output asked indent according It produce output formatting according BSD rule considered generalized form

The goal lab write program printing text given array String along maximum number character printed single line
Consider following series word given array newline whitespace character separating two element array The array element first four element Well I woke order
Given upper limit number character per line try squeeze many word possible line restriction two word separated least one whitespace
In case limit put Well first line barbecuing second line I fire third line forth
If next line supposed start word length word greater limit print onluy word line making exception enforced limit line length
We determine word included next line produced pair integer start end range index printed fromstart end
Given specific value start start exploring possible value end follows Once determined range index consider three possible way print word range For justified output output look like With output look like With output look like Your goal write code produce formatted output given input String array int specifying width int option specifying formatting used
Use template code development
The code component I intro computer science class
I know certain level code assignment code simple possible contain code learned advanced class
But instruction clear
Please find completed solution This program requires print given text taking care text alignment setting

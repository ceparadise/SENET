PCs smartphones also known general purpose machine
Most computer system follow input process output model
Abstraction decomposition key computing skill
All modern computer function general model
A computer receives input process information performs output
For example sending text message mobile phone The next diagram show sequence

Is bigger really better
Screen size measured diagonally
Many personal computer come inch screen
A inch screen fine single application application large graphic multiple window open sometimes inadequate
For hundred dollar inch better
There even bigger screen cost substantially
Bigger usually better expensive
Cathode ray tube monitor display text graphic common use today
Although CRTs color screen monochrome meaning one color usually green appears dark background
Another type screen technology liquid crystal display LCD flat display often seen watch calculator
LCD screen used laptop computer
Some LCDs monochrome color screen popular
Some laptop screen nearing CRTs resolution quality
A screen may monitor personal computer may part terminal one many terminal attached large computer
A terminal consists input device output device communication link main computer
Most commonly terminal keyboard input device screen output device although many variation theme
A printer device produce printed paper output known computer industry hard copy tangible permanent unlike soft copy displayed screen
Some printer produce letter number whereas others also produce graphic
Letters number formed printer either solid character character
printer create character way individual light pattern spell word basketball scoreboard
printer construct character activating matrix pin produce shape character
A traditional matrix five dot wide seven dot high
These printer sometimes called printer two extra vertical dot descender lowercase letter g j p
The printer us series overlapping dot dominates market
The dot better quality character produced
Some printer produce color image
There two way printing image paper impact method method
Let u take closer look difference
The term impact refers fact impact printer use sort physical contact paper produce image physically striking paper ribbon print hammer together
The impact may produced print hammer character like typewriter key striking ribbon paper print hammer hitting paper ribbon character
A printer one example impact printer
quality impact printer print one character time
However user concerned high volume high quality usually use line printer impact printer print entire line time
Organizations use mainframe minicomputer usually several line printer
Such organization likely print hearty report perhaps relating payroll cost internal use
The volume report fact seen customer make le expensive line printer appropriate
One final note impact printer An impact printer must used printing report duplicate copy receive imprint
A printer place image page without physically touching page
The major technology competing market laser
Laser printer use light beam help transfer image paper producing extremely result
Laser printer print page time impressive speed
Large organization use laser printer produce report
At personal computer end black white laser printer purchased hundred dollar
However color laser jet printer expensive
The rush laser printer influenced trend toward desktop personal computer laser printer special software make publication newsletter
printer spraying ink multiple jet nozzle print black white several different color ink produce excellent graphic
As good color printer perfect
The color see computer screen necessarily color see printed output
Nor likely color would see offset printing press
Nevertheless printer may bargain user want color output capability
There many advantage printer impact one two major reason growing popularity They faster quieter
Other advantage printer conventional mechanical printer ability change typeface automatically ability produce graphic
We already examined voice input detail
As see section however computer frequently like people sense find easier talk listen
Speech synthesis process enabling machine talk people much easier speech recognition
The key ignition car say open car door get
Machine voice real human voice
They product voice synthesizer also called device unit convert data main storage vocalized sound understandable human
There two basic approach getting computer talk
The first synthesis analysis device analyzes input actual human voice speaking word store process spoken sound reproduces needed
The process storing word similar digitizing process discussed earlier considering voice input
In essence synthesis analysis us computer digital tape recorder
The second approach synthesizing speech synthesis rule device applies complex set linguistic rule create artificial speech
Synthesis based human voice advantage sounding natural limited number word stored computer
Voice output become common place airline bus terminal bank brokerage house
It typically used inquiry followed short reply bank balance flight time
Many business found creative us voice output applies telephone
Automatic telephone voice Hello computer speaking


take survey inform customer catalog order ready picked perhaps remind consumer paid bill
Personal computer user occasionally sent primitive musical message feeble tone wheezed tiny internal speaker
Many user remain level significant change progress
Professional musician lead way using special sound chip simulate different instrument
A sound card installed internally computer attached speaker complete output environment
Now using appropriate software computer produce sound orchestra rock band
Those u simply enjoy music full experience using multimedia explore detail next chapter

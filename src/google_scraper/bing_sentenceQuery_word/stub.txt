A simply piece code used stand programming functionality
A stub may behavior existing code remote machine temporary substitute code
Stubs therefore useful well general software development
An example stub might follows The pseudocode utilises function return temperature
While would intended read hardware device function currently contain necessary code
So essence process yet return legal value allowing main program least partially tested
Also note although accepts type determines whether inside outside temperature needed use actual value passed caller logic
A stub routine actually anything declaring parameter accepts returning something usually value expected one happy scenario caller
Stubs used commonly placeholder implementation known interface implementation yet
The stub contains enough code allow compiled linked rest program
In nomenclature stub communicates

A piece code convert parameter passed client server
The main idea allow local computer remotely call procedure different computer
The client server use different parameter used function procedure call converted otherwise value parameter could used pointer parameter one computer memory would point different data computer
The client server may also use different data representation even simple parameter versus integer
Stubs perform conversion parameter remote procedure call look like local function call remote computer
Stub library must installed client server side
A client stub responsible conversion parameter used function call deconversion result passed server execution function
A server stub server side responsible deconversion parameter passed client conversion result execution function
Stubs generated one two way A server program implement procedure interface said interface client program call procedure interface said interface
When writing distributed application programmer first writes interface definition using IDL programmer write client program import interface server program export interface
The interface definition processed using IDL compiler generate component combined client server program without making change existing compiler
In particular interface procedure interface compiler generate appropriate marshalling unmarshalling operation stub procedure header file support data type interface definition
The header file included source file client server program client stub procedure compiled linked client program server stub procedure compiled linked server program
An IDL compiler designed process interface definition use different language enabling client server written different language communicate using remote procedure call
To achieve goal semantics transparency designer made RPC look like LPc using concept stub hide actual RPC implementation program interface underlying RPC system

For example mean quote
Integrating external API almost guarantee modern web app
To effectively test integration need
A good easy create consistently actual current API response
In post outline testing strategy using external API
A stub controllable replacement collaborator system
By using stub test code without dealing dependency directly
It object system code test interacts control
Common example filesystems thread memory time
Forexample code You want test method need simulate test method need create Fake Stub object simulate result want test code able test method
As see need simulate result another Dependency class object Existing Dependency object
A context mean mock implementation
That simple fake implementation conforms interface used testing
Layman term dummy data fake data test data etc
use test develop code party ready real data
It programmer Lorem Ipsum
Employee database ready
Make simple one Jane Doe John Doe etc
API ready
Make fake one creating static file containing fake data
You also good testing framework create stub
One preferrable There also others
But Mockito great read elegant powerfull package Stub function definition correct function name correct number parameter produce dummy result correct type
It help write test serf kind scaffolding make possible run example even function design complete By posting answer agree

In computer science program simulate behavior software component module module undergoing test depends
Test stub mainly used incremental testing
Stubs computer program act temporary replacement called module give output actual product software
Consider computer program query database obtain sum price total product stored database
In example query slow consumes large number system resource
This reduces number test run per day
Secondly test may include value outside currently database
The method call used perform
For testing purpose source code temporarily replaced simple statement return specific value
This would test stub
Several testing framework available software generates based existing source code testing requirement
Stubs Drivers two type test harness
Test harness collection software test data configured one test program unit simulating different set condition monitoring behavior output
Stubs driver dummy module created test purpose
Stubs used top testing approach one major module ready test sub module still ready yet
So simple language stub called program called test major module functionality
For example situation one three different module Login Home User
Suppose login module ready test two minor module Home User called Login module ready yet testing
At time piece dummy code written simulates called method Home User
These dummy piece code stub
On hand Drivers one calling program
Drivers used bottom testing approach
Drivers dummy code used sub module ready main module still ready
Taking example
Suppose time User Home module ready Login module ready test
Now since Home User return value Login module dummy piece code written simulates Login module
This dummy code called Driver

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I often hear term stub stub somethings stub etc
What stubbing mean programming word come
context used
example A stub method method return simple valid though necessarily correct result
They typically made building infrastructure want spend time every method needed right
Instead create stub everything compiles IDE know method planning use
Another place stub used mocking testing You supply stub method code testing relies upon dependency injection return fixed result ensure code right thing
This isolates testing code trying test mean need spin database run test
Perhaps best answered concrete example
Let consider case creating desktop application
You decided function named application constructor neat tidy
Your main code look something like example python Until everything working main function fail test app development
For example start working initialization fail creates menubar since implemented toolbar main area GUI
This stub come
You create function named satisfy requirement app constructor namely function exist without actually implement
These function stub With stub place begin implement main program menubar without worry detail toolbar main part program
Eventually move toolbar replace stub actual function
And finally remove stub give real implementation
Note stub necessarily nothing
These stub could example create empty container widget app constructor lay
The point create dummy function object let code run developing
Over time replace stub application complete
A stub used top programming
That building application general specific
In use stub placeholder specific application time build
They often return thing like dummy random value general part program
That right stub feed enough value make senior part program work
Until time stub replaced fitted true computation value

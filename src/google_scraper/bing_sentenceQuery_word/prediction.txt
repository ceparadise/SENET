A say statement
It often always based upon experience knowledge
There universal agreement exact difference two term different author discipline ascribe different
Contrast
Although guaranteed accurate information future many case impossible prediction useful assist making possible development Howard Stevenson writes prediction business least two thing Important hard
In sense term prediction often used refer
A prediction kind might informed predicting person may useful predicting person field
The technique eliciting prediction controlled way
This type prediction might perceived consistent statistical technique sense minimum data used predicting expert forming In prediction part
One particular approach inference known prediction undertaken within several approach statistical inference
Indeed one possible description statistic provides mean transferring knowledge sample population whole population related population necessarily prediction time
When information transferred across time often specific point time process known
Forecasting usually requires method prediction often performed
Statistical technique used prediction include various etc
In case forecasting model utilized
When related generalized set regression method deployed commercial usage field known
In many application time series analysis possible estimate model generate observation
If model expressed transfer function term parameter smoothed filtered predicted data estimate calculated
If underlying generating model linear smoother may used recover data interest noisy measurement
These technique rely predictor minimise variance prediction error
When generating model nonlinear stepwise linearizations may applied within smoother recursion
However nonlinear case optimum performance guarantee longer apply
To use regression analysis prediction data collected variable predicted called response variable one variable whose value influence called explanatory variable
A often linear hypothesized postulated causal relationship function chosen optimize way function thus parameterized data
That estimation step
For prediction step explanatory variable value deemed relevant future current yet observed value dependent variable input parameterized function generate prediction dependent variable
In science prediction rigorous often quantitative statement forecasting would happen specific condition example apple fell tree would attracted towards center earth specified constant
The built testing statement scientific theory
This done repeatable observational study
A contradicted observation evidence rejected
New theory generate many new prediction easily supported see
Notions make prediction usually considered part science nescience testable prediction made
frequently used describe past future behaviour process within boundary model
In case outcome rather specific outcome predicted example much
In permit avoidance emptying
In possible failure mode predicted avoided correcting mechanism causing failure
Accurate prediction forecasting difficult area
For example possible predict occurrence exact timing magnitude much difficult see picture right
Established science make useful prediction often extremely reliable accurate example routinely predicted
New theory make prediction allow disproved reality
For example predicting structure crystal atomic level current research challenge
In early century scientific consensus existed absolute given name
The existence absolute frame deemed necessary consistency established idea speed light constant
The famous demonstrated prediction deduced concept borne reality thus disproving theory absolute frame reference
The proposed Einstein explanation seeming inconsistency constancy speed light special preferred absolute frame reference
theory could easily tested produce effect observable terrestrial scale
However theory predicted large mass would bend light contradiction accepted theory observed eclipse
Mathematical model behaviour economic behaviour general also unreliable predicting future behaviour
Among reason economic event may span several year world changing similar time frame thus invalidating relevance past observation present
Thus extremely small number order relevant past data point project future
In addition generally believed stock market price already take account information available predict future subsequent movement must therefore result unforeseen event
Consequently extremely difficult predict
In contrast predicting actual stock return forecasting broad economic trend tends better accuracy
Such analysis provided group well private institution including brokerage house consulting company
Some correlation seen actual stock market movement prediction data large group survey prediction game
An us ass predict future business risk
For example actuary would use incorporates historical experience mortality rate sometimes estimate future trend project
Predicting outcome sporting event business grown popularity recent year
Handicappers predict outcome game using variety mathematical formula simulation model
Early well known sport bettor believed access information gave edge
Information ranged personal issue gambling drinking undisclosed injury anything may affect performance player field
Recent time changed way sport predicted
Predictions typically consist two distinct approach Situational play statistical based model
Situational play much difficult measure usually involve motivation team
Dan Gordon noted handicapper wrote Without emotional edge game addition value line I put money
These type play consist Betting home underdog betting Monday Night winner favorite next week betting underdog look ahead game etc
As situational play become widely known become le useful impact way line set
The widespread use technology brought modern
These system typically algorithm simulation model based

What make model interesting apart taking consideration relevant historical data also incorporate vague subjective factor like availability key player team fatigue team motivation
They provide user ability include best guess thing hard fact available
This additional information combined historical fact provide revised prediction future match outcome
The initial result based modelling practice encouraging since demonstrated consistent profitability published market odds
Nowadays sport betting huge business many website system alongside betting site give tip prediction future game
Some prediction website tipster based human prediction others computer software sometimes called prediction robot bot
Prediction bot use different amount data algorithm accuracy may vary
In common attempt predict outcome via technique ass popularity use

Predictions often made antiquity present using mean observing
Methods including many form used millennium attempt predict future
These mean prediction proven scientific experiment
In literature vision prophecy literary device used present possible timeline future event

Diviners ascertain interpretation proceed reading sign event alleged contact agency often describe angel god though viewed Christians Jews fallen angel demon
Fiction especially fantasy science fiction often feature instance prediction achieved unconventional mean

Prediction research fulfills one basic desire humanity discern future know fate hold
Such foresight used involve studying star looking entrails animal
Obviously pay heed method modern world many people expect scientist become new soothsayer predict humanity environment universe end
To certain extent scientist regularly use prediction research fundamental generate predict happen
These prediction effect direct whole scientific discipline Relativity underpinned research Physics Biology many year
On hand smaller experiment also wider ramification allow humanity predict therefore avoid future event
One earliest example Muslim scholar
He asked find best location build hospital city Baghdad
Cleverly hung piece meat predicted place meat took longest rot would best place build hospital
Although knew little exact process behind transmission illness realized environment unhealthier others especially hot climate gangrene problem
His idea used many year bacterial process behind illness uncovered
Sticking medicine later found wonderful work Semmelweiss scientist responsible saving countless thousand life
In Hungarian Ignaz Semmelweis close friend Jakob Kolletschka cut finger autopsy contracted nasty disease known puerperal fever
Semmelweis also killed percent woman giving birth hospital whilst nearby hospital run entirely midwife lost two percent birthing mother
Semmelweis noticed student moved autopsy room delivery room without washing hand predicted reason higher death rate teaching hospital
He informed student wash hand chlorine solution entering maternity wing mortality rate puerperal fever promptly dropped two percent
Unfortunately unfortunate Semmelweis became victim politics director hospital livid young doctor indirectly blaming high rate mortality made sure Semmelweis never worked Vienna
Eventually returned Budapest used method eventually publishing book finding
Sadly medical establishment rejected idea disillusioned Semmelweis died mental institution severely beaten guard
The autopsy revealed extensive internal injury cause death blood poisoning
Eventually Englishman Joseph Lister began using carbolic acid disinfectant year later gave Semmelweis full credit prediction research saved thousand life
The unfortunate scientist also gave name scientific phenomenon known Effect new research based upon bold prediction swiftly rejected threatens established paradigm much
Wegener also suffered effect postulated idea continental drift prediction rejected almost entire scientific community
One fine example making experimental prediction generating work conducted wonderfully innovative series physic experiment making prediction
After completed experiment showed prediction basis fitted observation made next prediction worked towards greater goal stage
Of course physicist also work end scale make huge prediction capable shaking world science
Some biggest proponent prediction research theoretical physicist Einstein Hawking
They use sweeping elegant mathematical theory predict think universe behaves
Their prediction actually guide direction entire scientific paradigm empirical physicist test attempt part theory leading refinement change
Astronomy thrown great example prediction science largely built upon law motion proposed Newton
One finest example arises discovery planet Neptune stand testament skill astronomer also work Newton
The discovery planet showed work largely correct circumstance Theory Relativity explained physic extreme scale
The planet Uranus discovered William Herschel made nearly one entire revolution sun
Excited astronomer realized looking star chart documenting progress planet orbit irregular follow Newtonian prediction planetary moment
They predicted possible explanation planet influence another large planet lying exerting gravitational pull
In Britain France astronomer set predict position new planet find
Two astronomer found planet Urbain Le Verrier Paris John Couch Adams Cambridge
Le Verrier take credit first announce discovery scientist located planet application Newtonian physic
This great advertisement power prediction research similar indirect deduction still used find cosmological object
Strangely enough even intuitively backwards looking discipline history us prediction research
Most historian state thesis equivalent set find evidence support deny
One greatest example adventurer Harald Schliemann
He firmly believed Homer Iliad gave geographical clue measurement would allow find site Priam Troy
Patiently collated information raised funding setting using Iliad roadmap
He found ruined city academic believe Troy prediction supported
His archaeological method crude destructive nobody fault detective work power prediction
As part humanity quest understand nature predictive science much widespread
Much due exponential growth computing power allows gradually detailed accurate model
These great use predicting weather natural disaster earthquake tsunami
The factor driving growth prediction research politics economics
Predicting weather benefit economy informing farmer expect allows emergency service predict adverse weather may require action
Economics prediction driven current economic crisis show incorrect prediction devastating although whether politician choose listen advice computer prediction model disagree policy another matter
With million dollar invested government oil company using prediction geologist know drill test well predictive science going grow
However entire field science computing rest upon foundation drove early scientist principle making prediction setting test
Unfortunately prediction whim paymaster whether government private sector
This always compromise integrity scientist making prediction prediction research always drive scientific method

How MOND
Last I heard prediction MOND true test almost would reveal certain perturbation planet I guessing gas giant solar system
Did test go
What result
I always thought falsification harder proof
How one falsify multiverse example
Falsifiable
Tell people coming interpretation quantum mechanic
One bother lot interpretation
It presumably falsifiable although Deutsch AFAIK considered
Proponents claim avoids measurement problem outcome realized somewhere Schroedinger wave keep evolving etc
But also say avoids measuring device special
I agree
Take interferometer setup
A photon split go around two path recombined
Then interference observed pattern hit detector output face
I suppose MWIzards say detector output split world detector continue receive interact partial wave function
But wait minute detector far line
Why world split occur way back path taking place different world
But would interference pattern even looking past one world
They claim MDs special treat instigator MW split sooner
So really MDs either special collapse instigator special alleged democratic handling MWI appears fallacious way
BTW Thanks Bee Snowy Warmth Heart name sound paradoxical
I know got one back I tried send FB acting flaky
Also folk I pleased Google search quantum measurement paradox check
I flattered hope deserve
I also planning roll demonstration decoherence interpretation collapse phenomenon flawed
experimental reproduced everybody appropriate education
For HEP changed reproducible
Our model scientific theory theory work Kepler Newton Maxwell Darwin etc
Most explicitly prediction embed immense predictive power
The distinctive feature theory physic mathematical mean prediction quantitative
One virtue fact even small effect perihelion shift light deflection GR Lamb shift magnetic moment QED
I left decisive
sometimes data already awaits theoretical explanation versus calculate cosmological constant agreement today measured value prediction postdiction In general post concise informative quite exact
I still certain problem minute detail respect symmetry radiative time arrow though
The explanation existing thing history new way always postdiction prediction new interpretation
The subject evolutionary theory big bang theory whole prediction perspective
For example Heim theory reconcilling QM gravity way mass electron predicted agrees seven digit value observed wet dream every theorist btw
In way predicts explanation electron mass remote future
Regarding requirement Bee I two point The axiom assumption theory could regarded prediction
Similarly prediction made general ground
expectation based general physical principle principle theory could regarded prediction prediction strictly outcome precise mathematical calculation context strict mathematical framework
strictly outcome precise mathematical calculation context strict mathematical They falsifiable reproducible
This always mean exact
Sometimes underlying rigor poorly conditioned derivation based fuzzy logic would become relevant
But still remain falsifiable context logic
For example heliocentric model predicts order Venus phase
This prediction surprisingly difficult formalize language formal math could explained geocentric model
The Occam razor sorta Lagrangian causal space best criterion falsifiability
Hi Giotis In general axiom assumption prediction since set base theory prediction derived specific case
Eg axiom quantum mechanic assume energy level hydrogen atom axiom general relativity assume radar echo delay etc
Best B
axiom assumption theory could regarded prediction

This question illustrates independence implicate geometry causal time arrow local time arrow
The answer simply depends time coordinate system choosed
Zephir I glad like post
The explanation existing fact prediction making prediction know fact
It matter procedure
If know want outcome know data already risk substantially higher biased wishful thinking reason distinction postdiction prediction
Maybe confused I meant event future
While event big bang might past I referring would statement measurement made future statement result
Best B
Is explanation Big bang event prediction postdiction
It explains process occurred deep past I mean deep light perceived observer still travel
We assume existing light would reach event horizon far future perspective postdiction becomes prediction
Hi Neil As I said explanation valuable even make prediction
See I think science first line understanding
If new interpretation improves understanding theory dismissed useless since could provide path new insight
I find MWI much improves understanding QM though
However somebody find improves understanding differs one next
Best Hi Arun I said theory reproducible everybody appropriate education experiment
Though latter say reproducible least principle
Best Zephir Please read reply earlier comment
The point big bang past measurement whose outcome calculated theory future
The event make prediction observation
Best B
making prediction know fact
It matter procedure I said
For example special relativity assuming constant speed light
But still know whether speed light really constant circumstance
It effectivelly prediction POV
So opionion local reference frame crucial consideration reference frame prediction postdictions
It simply independent
CIP I agree far physic concerned
There field science though quantification prediction much harder
Best Zephir I already told need assume constancy speed light derive special relativity
You find
Last time refused read claiming bullshit referred Wikipedia entry evidently also read
I want repeat fruitless exchange
You either show wrong proof shut
Either way place discus special relativity please omit demonstration misunderstanding
Best B
In principle Popper methodology assuming never sure anything I mean observation theory
From point view every assumption reality technically sort prediction
AWT considers process theory validation regression fit patching experience causal space
Reality appears like foam theory appears like piece causal foam
And trying whether piece foam fit reality foam well
The local time frame observer nothing successful theory would fit reality tightly atemporal way
Are looking TOE explain existing observation well could supply prediction possible
These two criterion quite equivalent
Hi Bee Yes ok point I understand distinction derived result consequence general
Strings prediction String theory
The quantizized prediction QG theory
The dynamical metric field prediction GR
The reason looking physical consequence side effect verify theory call prediction hard falsify general axiom theory
There reason
Bottom line point hard determine constitutes prediction give formal definition
More le theory prediction
What come call prediction result inability practice verify theory
http Somebody look
prediction String theory
One reason main one fact science distinguishes logical causual time arrow point arrow may different time arrow definition
If I would mix prediction concept perspective radiative whatever else arrow local time prediction concept context causual implicate geometry predicate logic completelly abstract independent physical time arrow
In geometry causuality time arrow defined orientation scalar component antecedent consequent implication tensor physical time arrow
Thanks moving forward explanation
When Cosmic Variance spoke reminded saying scientist gather together opinion direction funding allocated question experiment fund become important question regard research gone direction want go
As lay person I sure I could excluded assessment number type experiment going similarity involved demonstrate scientific principal term signal noise ratio specific calculation particle outlay according consideration
I seen Stefan self moved toward estimate consider high energy particle scenario
While seeking validation work ongoing
What would say term classifying extra dimension leading new psychic given space understood
Is space predicted post diction
Best Yes mathematics let dream
Falsifiability seems belong infancy physic experiment falsify seem outside range capability
That mean theory wrong reality
Dear Bee We human know talking essay work
However try educate machine much careful else make musicology science scientific prediction
I press key piano tomorrow I get middle C note Hz statement future event based theory music scale reproducible consistent conflict data available falsifiable
However philosophical I agree wrote
Best Hi Bee thanks nice post I agree definition scientific prediction
In world experimental physic distinction prediction clear useful
Explaining meson mass spectrum via application string theory would wonderful clearly since know spectrum well
Stating mass neutralino confirming terrestrial scattering experiment would impressive prediction
Perhaps dispel misunderstanding one could say scientific prediction statement outcome controlled experiment one yet done
This avoids discussion arrow time make distinction striking piano key
anyway nice post
Michael Hi Giotis No string prediction string theory
What kind prediction
What predict
A prediction string theory would tell eg energy resonance signature etc
Quantized spacetime neither axiom prediction problem consistently make sense expression begin
A dynamical metric field prediction GR prediction statement measurement derived use axiom
Best Zephir I deleted several comment
I already told half dozen time argument faulty every theory many different axiom system equivalent
If one u violating principle discussion since replying argument I raise explain mistake thought repeat nonsense like broken record
I notice annoy tire Stefan also several frequent visitor whose constructive comment I value much
I thus continue delete repetition offer new information well mentioning theory something
As comment rule say want discus something else topic post please get blog
Thanks Dear Arun I would argue musical example scientific prediction
It particularly interesting insightful
What interesting human I guess would indeed hard explain machine
Best B
prediction statement measurement derived use axiom What extra dimension
There statement specific measurement regarding extra dimension String theory point view nevertheless prediction theory
If evidence extra dimension discovered experiment I suppose would verification prediction
So theory make statement physical world general
Whether statement could translated statement specific measurement thousand year relative uncertain depends many factor
This mean theory make prediction
You see point
Machine human matter distinction separated trying extend perception basis reality given space
So resonance would possibility connecting one level matter state machine another human according stage want assign machine calibration focus versus human standard measure thought thought use measure
All road lead
Using cosmic particle scenario relation man made distinctive measure lead
A point possibly holding infinite
How strange reductionism run course something yet found
Predict shall find
Best Oh New York time article Frank Wilczek regard strong force might identify
Giotis wrote No
assumption hypothesis postulate perhaps requirement string theory prediction
If turn verified mean considered assumption valid
A prediction must outcome theory like instance bending light around sun predicted general theory relativity
OTOH assumption hypothesis postulate based general principle principle equivalence principle general covariance
It also assumes SR locally valid inertial frame
So prediction mean assumption theory valid probed regime consequence theory regarded acceptable assumption domain validity analysed
I think Bee refering theory axiom I mistaken
However I would call axiom proposition regarded generally accepted
Best Christine Christine Extra dimension definitely axiom They derived theory based SR QM conformal symmetry SUSY course existence dimensional object Planck scale
Their number outcome specific strict mathematical calculation
Dear Bee That prediction important musician expects piano produce right note important derives income time prediction fails Anyway reason philosophical reasoning get involved precisely explainable principle machine alien outer space
I sure useful insight come extra precision maybe reader example
Best Hmmm interesting
One imago certain amount squirming chair perspiration brow justification
Doth protest much
Methinks Xtasy bash
What fun watch enthusiastic celebrant try explain unfortunate behavior
Golly good show rigor
Ulrich Posted dorigo So Fermi let u look universe one way look forward
John Learned Sandip Pakvasa Zee How alien
Christine Giotis Giotis right extra dimension assumption string theory conclusion arising requiring theory physically meaningful
Best Hi Giotis I see point sorry
I certainly want dictate people use specific word understanding I expressed post extra dimension prediction
Extra dimension even statement whatsoever mention statement future measurment
The existence extra dimension consequence string theory
A prediction tell going happen measurement
The correct formulation would String theory requires existence extra dimension model extra dimension make prediction testable LHC
It exactly frequently formulated sloppily people seem think LHC test string theory
Best Dear Arun I doubt good definition interesting individually different
In case I tried sketch scientific prediction interesting scientific prediction
Being pressed I argue revealed preference
Best Hi Michael Frequently I hear talk experimentalists running measurement cosmic ray dark matter etc I impressed careful decide advance analyze data
In field awareness importance seems low
I stunned read paper study performed seems happen quite frequently researcher search correlation post hoc subgroup analysis serendipitous inclusion exclusion patient
I sure exactly latter supposed mean interpretation basically found correlation sample subgroup till one show correlation happen chance sample sufficiently
The result postiori tempering sort subgroup people everybody died mortality
Best Ok I accept extra dimension prediction according definition point whether extra dimension prediction nothing theory
The prediction lie outside theory
People often use fact certain theory currently make prediction attack core theory
My scope demote prediction peripheral secondary issue
It relative dynamical depends mostly factor outside theory
Let say example GR appeared discovery problem precession perihelion Mercury
Then It would prediction GR discovery
This nothing GR though
The prediction lie outside theory
So phrase usually used The theory make prediction vacant pointless
As I said previously I repeat Theories make statement physical world general
Whether statement could translated statement specific measurement thousand year relative uncertain depends many factor
To I would add within scope theory make prediction
The scope theory explain physical world
Whether would prediction nothing theory
In respect I would much agree point end post
I previously wrote If willing make sense supersymmetric string theory dimension required
It turn making sense mathematical consistency requirement
Not physical one
Then must introduce hypothesis physical world order proceed theory
I believe I stand correct
Extra dimension introduced Weyl Symmetry gauge symmetry classical level anomalous theory quantized
In order eliminate gauge anomaly extra dimension introduced critical String theory
The fact gauge symmetry classical level retained quantization order theory make sense physical requirement mathematical
Giotis wrote begin quote end quote Any scientific theory least one logical consequence derived assertion
Otherwise completely vacuous
Any logical consequence theory prediction
A theory tested principle one scientific method applied scientific theory
It speculation
And confuse prediction forecast
Finally please people stop trying change meaning scientific method order accommodate one wish
Nature care
This need rigorousness scientific method otherwise deceptive
This brings high cost

A scientific prediction falsifiable
In practice mean often implausifiable
Bee common mistake writing English write mean vice versa
I make mistake time
Pls correct delete post well thanks know matter time dear old Lubos get wind thread start dumping yet especially String Theory raised
In case go back enough worldsheet describing embedding string spacetime mathematical hypothesis theory
You may encode physical requirement like gauge field conformally worldsheet
Yet still working mathematical consistency way
And advance supersymmetry also using hypothesis least hypothesis superstring theory
firmly dependent hypothesis
This understanding course
Hi Bee Thanks well written thoughtful post along many others forming quite valuable resource may curious practice science brings term method subsequent demand
There little found could argued represent doubt expected addressed scientific perspective remain objectively dispelled able relieve opposed method often serve increase reason remain
The thing I would wish point rather clarify despite much science struggle totally objective never discovered without omission measure subjective enable process begin
However even though true I find often confused although may seem fit demand science seeming contradiction certainly resolved way greatest demand considered proof
That recognize better incomplete picture nature regard substance action rather tempted think known reason undemonstrated undemonstratable logical assumption
The unfortunate result one think modified longer hold true foundation philosophy longer science
So although may disappoint expectation adhered science value virtue utility remain uncompromised
Best Phil Christine said Any scientific theory least one logical consequence derived assertion
Otherwise completely vacuous
Any logical consequence theory prediction
This definition different Bee definition
According Bee A prediction tell going happen measurement
In post I referring Bee definition
According definition extra dimension prediction logical consequence theory contradicts previous statement extra dimension prediction
Yes Giotis right I appropriately said logical consequence resulting theory must describable term measurement accordance Bee definition otherwise also vacuous
My position still prediction
My position still prediction
Christine It good position one favorite
THAT pop String Theory logical consequence making Math fit Theory fit Reality seems VERY
That ST predicts infinite number particle type mass ALONE make want kick Strings curb horrible thing well aside may talking Anthropic version fair David Gross Theorists believe Strings reject Anthropic version I say I master Quantum Field Theory talk shop properly I openly ask many seriously considered possibility Ted Kaluza right Oskar Klein wrong albeit
We know know failed noble first attempt unification thank God Paul Dirac point
My point theory
We gotten deep debate small rolled extra direction lost sight may one large extra spatial one implication thereof
Phil wrote The thing I would wish point rather clarify despite much science struggle totally objective never discovered without omission measure subjective enable process begin

Happy New Year
argument faulty every theory many different axiom system equivalent It possible prove Minkovski space postulate replace constant speed light postulate completely circumstance thinkable
Is possible give evidence general case

Anyway Happy New Year though resolution bother anymore backreaction
Zephir It called projection Zephir
insulted came stress noticed coul counter argument
It great progress least understood possible derive special relativity without assuming constancy speed ligh
And yes I prove please
It course hold circumstance since outcome usual special relativity usual effect prediction
Let add proof completely standard construction found many textbook mathematical physic
The symmetry group SO
That speed massless particle constant follows kinematics space
Why finally go read I wrote
That I deleted comment nothing alledged cowardice repetition faulty argument useless add new information clog comment section
Let repeat post special relativity please think I said digest quietly
Happy New Year I struggle existence theory principle practice would require virtually resource actually experiment
What status theory distinguished others assistance instrument light year across require conversion stellar mass pure energy
This rare problem science one seems afflict frontier physic cosmology profoundly
I also struggle anthropism
In principle multiversal landscape finite explored using sophistication empirical corroboration vacuum complete absence selection principle narrow search
However number vacuum considered large even fraction second spent would take trillion year perform thorough search practical use theory
Even selection principle unless stringent process elimination may nearly sufficient reduce exploration time average lifespan solar system
That much better
I see easy solution
On one hand set arbitrary standard practicality
experiment would take god count well arbitrary
Or live current situation mind inevitably downgrading importance experimentation defining constitutes scientific exploration
bother anymore
attempt censorship
symmetry group SO But special relativity invariant Poincaré group Lorentz group
The claim valid locally Poincaré group could lead much complex
Common aspect model still mean evidence model equivalent
Your cowardice proven experimentally deleting post answered moment reader possibility reconstruct flow discussion
It pitty I must learn trivial principle dialectic discussion Bee
Zephir As I said I deleted comment entirely superfluous repetition faulty earlier argument
I explained mistake continued repeat thing deletion made avoid reader would read nonsense also belong comment section dozen time
Even discussion already also able understand I saying
This blog alone
If respect rule I act
If like good bye
Yes sorry right I meant Poincaré group
This part proof trivial since translation invariant
Best Hi Low Math Yes important issue one I avoided address I really much intelligent say
I guess underlying question pursue science
Best Christine Yes Giotis right I appropriately said logical consequence resulting theory must describable term measurement accordance Bee definition otherwise also vacuous
My position still prediction
Dear Christine genuinly interested learn topic experimental stringy signature large extra dimensional scenario find relevant information paper String Phenomenology LHC http There specific prediction
emergence Regge excitation quark gluon
These feature clearly distinguish stringy physic scenario
Low Math Meekly Interacting The best science always testable
Sometimes take long time actually observe atomic basis matter prediction sill made
It easy test General Relativity made testable prediction eventually tested many time
The farther physic get feasible bizarre theoretical physic becomes pressure physicist come back reality
Just watch happen lifetime
Ulrich Zephir This time Stefan deleted comment
You already accused I quoting nothing say
That exactly deleting comment repeat already said without taking account reply
You even trying lead dialogue Zephir leading monologue repetitive one addition

The man without quality well staying people topic far le jumping hoop
He also unfortunate weakness smirking human weakness
But honest honorable enough recognize blog wish productive illuminating
Sincerely Ulrich Hi Bee In drawing attention phenomenology role scientific discovery become mindful paper I read
Bell time ago entitled How teach special relativity review route taken Lorentz Poincare Fitzgerald effort explain phenomenology presented Morley experiment
What I find paper amply show examination may lead one realization Einstein came thing encompassed principle synopsised two character nature show however simply attempting explain phenomenon term action one arrive place predicatively account never le
After reading paper thing stood ask two route stand better term representing science
With Lorentz Poincare Fitzgerald approach action nature described series recipe fixed reference frame still considered real although undetectable Einstein undetectably become irrelevant denied
However practical standpoint term able make prediction nature demonstrated action two indistinguishable
So come ask think strictly Einstein precursor thought legitimate explained set phenomenon simply mathematically consistent rule explained term nature quality instance say preferred reverence frame anyone arbitrarily chosen law nature remain
So question come asking oneself nature collection arbitrarily chosen yet set action explainable series interlinked interdependent recipe rather structure consequence reason leaving choice must
For come ask one many way known reality come real I answer affirmative choice simply reason physically unable demonstrated
So considered I would ask phenomenology true role physic
That u simply able make prediction regard action world find reason behind mandate action
When I consider first insistence thing real one way reason would dictate I would say physic answered aid phenomenology latter question rather first
Of course opinion find minority day thing concerned demotes reason anything imagined sometimes reason assignable
So I would finally ask importance demonstrated thing like symmetry conservation least action invariance covariance able explained away seeming purposeless randomness uncertainty believe also another necessity nature reality present rather one many way
Best Phil One possibility randomness artificial concept applicable human mathematical model nature
I think Spinoza said
If world strictly deterministic quantum weirdness vanishes like mist
I think
Bell said
Happy new year decade century Ulrich Ulrich said One possibility randomness artificial concept applicable human mathematical model nature

I think Spinoza said

If world strictly deterministic quantum weirdness vanishes like mist

I think
Bell said
And Einstein refused believe quantum indeterminism steadfastly argued hidden variable behind hypothetical quantum mechanic
I agree three
It seems obvious determinism must true random probabilistic description physic simply reflect factor force properly accounted
Truly random event seem quite bizarre concept since demand something happens reason cause without possible explanation
Thinking Einstein metaphor god rolling dice say physicist actually believe outcome roll dice completely determined principle calculable simply probabilistic outcome
Hi Ulrich Lottery player would agree randomness artificial sure THIS time buck odds win
Casino owner cheat
stacking odds favor definitely know randomness artificial made
Please tell authority
I sure intuition tell nonlinear dynamic hold key randomness quantum world
Who working anyone
Hi William Boston We like Einstein WANT Determinism true see nothing else length scale macroscopic scale exist
But way work length scale quantum particle like
Einstein like I like like nobody like way
To credit Einstein accepted basic tenet Quantum Mechanics eventually seek seek though causal deterministic explanation
He succeed neither anyone else
But good news time get closer every day
Hidden variable however found unnecessary
See David Bohm John Stewart Bell
Is weird
Yes
But true
Also yes
Hi Steven William Ulrich I hope one took argument phenomenology reveal science deny uncertainty quantum process surely
I even making argument randomness matter since actuality something reproduced mathematically yet system driven calculated
Actually point I making many come believe apparent randomness nature brings predictable result outcome course true since often part process assures opinion made available end result favourable favoured
The best example I think evolution random used part process best assure continuance life yet particular specie rather often expense
To like saying stir cake ingredient evenly mixed indicates cake purpose u certain cake baking solely random used element process
That simply say randomness leading uncertainty randomness leaving thing always uncertain
Another way look one uncertain accomplish something way arrive try everything yet still say anymore one way something like reality perhaps Best Phil So Phil I guess Aristotle saying deterministic reason everything since perfect knowledge initial condition exist although lack knowledge result appear random
illusion randomness
I believe Heisenberg take Uncertainty Principle
I also believe Bohr better take
Hi Steven Well I even say I certain pun intended
Rather I said outset random something reproduced mathematically yet likelihood outcome thing indicates manifested
For instance definition randomness mathematical perspective relation set theory set element needed describe smaller set describes
No rather I saying system incorporate random something required possible could missed result
That say I find existence called reality incredible I see random indicative might require considering possible outcome arrived
That sort whole argument random indicates nature turned completely around say random process assure particular outcome rather uncertain
In quantum mechanical perspective Heisenberg uncertainty principle assured stability atomic structure rather assured
So I saying people certain think know random relates process meaning indicates endless possible way assure reality
Best Phil William Boston If read Ian Stewart entertaining highly enlightening book Does God Play Dice I highly recommend
My bet nonlinear dynamical system theory combined better understanding hierarchical organization nature able reproduce quantum phenomenon completely deterministic manner note uninitiated causally determined unpredictable mutually exclusive concept proven logically
Steve Colyer Sigh
Bohr great mathematical physicist confused natural philosopher
You going process learn live
Keep smiling Ulrich Unfortunately many issue concerning quantum interpretation testable therefore scientific prediction
Some say decoherence interpretation testable since calculate long decoherence take course find one state look
Yeah already know always one state experiment keep thing superposed awhile
They also claim avoid true randomness since state evolves deterinistically albeit another world
However I bring complaint like one upthread first beam splitter MZ separate wave two different world case interference
In case I worked test DI using interferometer
It would experimentally disprove DI claim scrambling phase originally coherent state convert mixture
Such mixture claimed like classical occurrence one state
Phil well blog although experimental setup destroyed wave function information still gathered fact thus decoherence serve actual explanation observation
Check post Decoherence Interpretation Falsified
BTW I changed blog handle Neil B help distinguish
I image might help Bee remember one made regard triangle
The might interesting
What use Twistor Theory correlated way view seen useful science today
Best Ah
Perhaps within context Scientific prediction mind map might useful refence article
Precursors Manhattan economic project derive basis framework outcome society would attempt offer new method consideration

I gave two example way Penrose Bee term relativity ever question dynamically exactly relation natural world toward identifying relationship world
Now I given example throw others show would describe process truth I attempted
Best Predicting existence superparters string theory definitely qualifies scientific prediction
Just definite result mass spectrum way undermine fact
Discovery supersymmetry LHC first confirmed prediction string theory
Anonymous Oh yes undermine fact
And read I wrote wiser
Show ca supersymmetry without string theory
Best B
Show ca supersymmetry without string theory
Suppose LHC discovered superpartners
We know scale supersymmetry breaking directly related mass gravitino superpartner graviton
In gravity mediation gravitino mass set scale superpartner mass whereas gauge mediation gravitino typically LSP The presence gravitino automatically implies global SUSY local extension supergravity
supergravity UV complete theory arises low energy limit string compactifications
Back Maskawa Kobayashi theory required least three family quark prediction confirmed experimentally
Note predict mass top bottom quark must exist
The fact Kobatashi Maskawa theory predict mass third generation prevent getting Nobel Prize awarded large part predicting existence third generation
The fact string theory requires therefore predicts existence superpartners definitely catogory
Anonymous You show I asked could I suggest write paper post link
Besides Maskawa Kobayashi knew CP violation real data
If LHC see supersymmetry mean supersymmetry
Not le
This would clearly good news string theory
Your argument equivalent following Consider whatever reason people worked LQG Newton around
Then go recover Newton law make prediction prediction found correct conclude fundamentally spacetime string network
Oh
Wiat
There logical gap argument
If really understand I saying ask actually need string theory compute SUSY
Best B
I meant spin network
If really understand I saying ask actually need string theory compute SUSY
OK case missed I said discovery susy LHC automatically implies supergravity
Supergravity UV complete theory
Strings known UV completion
So example gauge mediated scenario process involving gravitino LSP beyond would require knowledge UV complete theory
You suggest ok use compute multiloop amplitude
Furthermore many SUSY model people rely higher order correction
Kahler potential order find vacuum spontaneously broken SUSY correction computed one know UV theory
string theory
There plenty paper people using
tool extract correction
Writing paper would silly I saying common knowledge
Some model SUSY breaking le sensitive UV physic others always
Anonymous I miss said evidently understand reply
That one theory UV completion observed feature proof
It logical gap
Consequently observation feature allow draw conclusion want draw
To make clear Strings SUSY
For claim true needed SUSY Strings
I repeat saying known game town proof
You seem know talking take deep breath notice missing link argument
Finally hiding behind anonymity nothing expression cowardice
Best B
I repeat saying known game town proof
Using type logic proof several alternative framework UV complete supergravity string theory statement empty
What saying logically true content free
You apply logic many phenomenon supersymmetry argue existing known possibility therefore proof true explanation
So
BTW thanks compliment I suspected coming My empty statement simply claim logically false agreed
Thanks B
But logic logically sound completely empty based hypothetical assumption
Look logic lead To make clear BCS theory low TC
For claim true needed low TC BCS theory
Hence logic one always make claim may exist yet another alternative BCS theory reproduces low TC
So
The claim like claim string theory possible UV completion supergravity empty unless come viable alternative allows perform actual computation order answer specific question
higher order correction Kahler potential supergravity
But someone come apply logic saying may yet another alternative may reproduce correction spectrum etc
But physic pure sophistry
To make constructive suggestion maybe anonymous could try make point without recourse know rhetoric
I nuclear theorist know
Is possible explain know give u confidence safely dismiss option
Hi Stefan
Good point thanks know would like stand chance understood
It reminds case law represents US thing thought fair decided based precedent rather actual situational circumstantial reasoning
However I think greater problem Bee facing situation analogous concept found eastern philosophy one warned tallest nail pounded
That Anonymous friend rendered safe leaving recognized pounder also known tall stand
Bee cite simply cowardice yet I find difference foolish coward clever one latter certainly represents ethically vacuous therein dangerous kind
That lady justice shown wearing blindfold rather accused jury
Best Phil First previous post displayed I sure make sense post I respond Stefan anyway
The person used know thread Steven never objected usage We know criticizing choice word
If prefer passive voice replace know known
If something known personally nullify statement I made
If topic interest need pick texbook look thing use Google
When I said common knowledge I really meant everything I said known people working area would ridiculous publish paper Bee suggested
If interested physic content post fire away question please pick choice word
I lawyer Is possible explain know give u confidence safely dismiss option
I working formal string theory
I rather describe Beyond Standard Model particle phenomenologist
However matter practice string theory AVAILABLE tool allows perform specific computation supergravity
There option available would allow perform computation
None
So NOTHING dismiss
Until option appear string theory known way compute certain quantity sensitive UV physic
Let give one specific example type computation I talking one would able perform effective supergravity string theory give answer
So go Suppose want compute kinetic term charged chiral matter multiplets quark lepton
If read literature notice often assumed kinetic term canonical mSUGRA minimal supergravity come
However assumption often made make analysis easier underlying symmetry reason
In general supergravity term depend certain scalar field called modulus
However charged chiral matter field part supergravity multiplet string theory come open string kinetic term computable type dimensional reduction higher dimensional supergravity theory
Note I even talking higher order correction
The known way obtain use worldsheet CFT method
In particular one need compute scatting amplitude involving modulus closed string mode charged chiral matter open string mode
Here one example http Sorry last point related example I gave previous post
The importance knowing precise form kinetic term charged chiral matter field huge directly related flavor problem susy breaking scenario
Any kind kinetic mixing sfermions different family generically lead Flavor Changing Neutral Currents
These highly constrained experiment make one popular scenario susy breaking
gravity mediation highly sensitive UV physic
String worldsheet CFT technique known way compute coupling supergravity alone nothing say
None alternative come anywhere close answering question
Anonymous Stefan Phil As probably noticed comment moderation thread like older day
That comment get post older week spam typically come bulk script I believe sometimes several bulk per day
Before blogger offered feature selective comment moderation go visit every single site deleting comment
Now get piped comment moderation queue I visit I like hit delete
This virtually limited number spam comment blog zero save lot time
It disadvantage comment appear I time publish
It clear comment blog administrator Stefan end moderation queue
Thus might confusing Stefan comment appeared
I see however I published correct time order
Anonymous Your example BCS theory unfortunately show still understand I telling
If I relate example initial claim BCS theory analogue SUSY string theory
BCS theory force whole bulk untestable sophistry
Wait BSC prediction string theory
Since example Newton law evidently abstract I give different example
Why Higgs gotten Nobelprize yet
We know particle mass
Arguably Higgs mechanism THE commonly accepted explanation
We
Clearly though proof particle mass Higgs let dwell different Higgses possible point
Consequently committee give Nobelprize want see Higgs rspt decent signature know I mean
Similarly claim evidence string show string
Not susy particle
I hope notice later elaboration pulling computation specific process already far initial claim
Your initial claim The existence superparters scientific prediction string theory
Meanwhile In currently investigated scenarions string theory technique used compute certain
Best Hi Phil Yes exactly every anonymous coward like one get step closer disabling anonymous comment
While I signing name finally understands wrong walk around continuing spread mistaken belief
For situation I lose least I lose time anyway
And exactly nothing cowardice anonymous friend clearly afraid shown wrong afraid damaging reputation
Best B
Anonymous Forgot You said would ridiculous publish paper Bee suggested
What I asked publish paper figured logically false
Best I seen comment anonymous queue
BCS theory seems actually instructive example
As know superconductivity experimentally thoroughly studied phenomenon BCS theory long explanation turned much wider scope explain conventional superconductivity
Let suppose nuclear theorist come BCS phenomenon superconductivity established know BCS applies nuclear structure hence predicted existence
Let suppose cuprate superconductors discovered conventional superconductors
What would told u BCS
At least discarded theory superconductivity
I never said even hinted discarding string theory
What I saying suppose somebody explained electron actually noiseless subsystem electron form lead phenomenon superconductivity
Now observe superconductivity
Can conclude world network
No actually tested anything particular underlying theory
That might time known explanation electron entirely irrelevant
Same thing supersymmetry
If observe SUSY partner LHC evidence SUSY realized Nature
Not le
What anonymous saying carefully measure able pin detail etc
That certainly true quite far original bold statement Discovery supersymmetry LHC first confirmed prediction string theory
Finally let ask obvious question If LHC see evidence SUSY consider string theory falsified
I would consider ST rope SUSY particle found energy string theorist predict especially Vafa prediction stau know String Theorists
Backed wall many time since bosonic string find way
Nevertheless Bee point well taken
The discovery SUSY validate Strings merely wo INvalidate
Superstring theory far one SUSY applicable

Hi Bee Stefan Personally difficulty I new theory appear grab bag thing account rather serving minimize

Predication work executing instruction path branch permitting instruction taken path modify architectural state
The instruction taken path permitted modify architectural state associated used instruction control whether instruction allowed modify architectural state
Most contain code executed specific condition depending factor determined beforehand example depending user input
As majority simply execute next sequence traditional solution insert instruction allow program conditionally branch different section code thus changing next step sequence
This sufficient designer began improving performance implementing method slowed branch
For thorough description problem arose popular solution see
Luckily one common pattern code normally relies branching elegant solution
Consider following On system us conditional branching might translate looking similar With predication possible branch path coded inline instruction execute others
The basic idea instruction associated predicate word used similarly usage instruction executed predicate true
The machine code example using predication might look something like Note beside eliminating branch le code needed total provided architecture provides predicated instruction
While guarantee faster execution general block code short enough
Predication simplest form architecture instruction
Conditional move instruction write content one register another predicate value true whereas conditional select instruction choose two register content written third based predicate value
A generalized capable form
Full predication set predicate register storing predicate allows multiple nested sequential branch simultaneously eliminated instruction architecture register specifier field specify predicate register supply predicate
The main purpose predication avoid jump small section program code increasing effectiveness execution avoiding problem
It also number subtle benefit Predication primary drawback increased encoding space
In typical implementation every instruction reserve bitfield predicate specifying condition instruction effect
When available memory limited space cost prohibitive
However architecture able avoid issue see
Other detriment following Predication effective path balanced longest path frequently executed determining path difficult compile time even presence
Predicated instruction popular European computer design including

I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking
Thank interest question

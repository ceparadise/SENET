Integration testing take input unit tested group larger aggregate applies test defined integration aggregate delivers output integrated system ready
Some different type integration testing mixed sandwich
Other Integration Patterns collaboration integration backbone integration layer integration integration distributed service integration integration
In approach developed module coupled together form complete software system major part system used integration testing
This method effective saving time integration testing process
However test case result recorded properly entire integration process complicated may prevent testing team achieving goal integration testing
testing approach integrated testing lowest level component tested first used facilitate testing higher level component
The process repeated component top hierarchy tested
All bottom module procedure function integrated tested
After integration testing lower level integrated module next level module formed used integration testing
This approach helpful module development level ready
This method also help determine level software developed make easier report testing progress form percentage
testing approach integrated testing top integrated module tested branch module tested step step end related module
Sandwich testing approach combine top testing bottom testing
One limitation sort testing condition stated specified integration test outside confirmation execution design item generally tested

System integration testing SIT software testing process tester verify related system maintain data integrity operate coordination system environment
The testing process ensures subcomponents integrated successfully provide expected result
SIT validates data integrity different make specified system
The SIT process occurs unit testing validation testing
Due fact SIT concentrate testing dependency often subjected regression testing scenario
Regression testing facilitates addition new test case
From application perspective SIT testing focus access actual data passed component initial connectivity
The main goal SIT testing test automation aggregated component dependency exist
In complex environment tedious task number component dependency
SIT testing ensures follows dependency available sequence thereby simplifying task
After system integration performed data flow testing take place three state namely data state within integration database application layer
Test case SIT testing developed using test design technique Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

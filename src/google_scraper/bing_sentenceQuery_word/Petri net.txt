These used describing designing studying discrete dynamical system characterized concurrent asynchronous distributed parallel random nondeterministic
As graphical tool Petri net used planning designing system given objective practically effective flowchart block diagram
As mathematical tool enables one set state equation algebraic equation mathematical model govern behavior discrete dynamical system
Still drawback inherent representing discrete
They suffer state explosion problem happen system highly populated initial state consists large number place nonempty
This phenomenon may lead exponential growth reachability graph
This make u study safe system
The aim chapter present basic result Petri net generate element Boolean hypercube marking vector
Complete Boolean hypercube popular interconnection network many attractive well known property regularity symmetry strong connectivity embeddability recursive construction etc
For brevity shall call Petri net generates binary marking vector
theoretical interest also practical importance required practice construct control system
In chapter consider problem characterizing class Boolean Petri net also class Boolean Petri net Boolean Petri net generate binary exactly
We show existence disconnected Boolean Petri net whose reachability tree homomorphic complete lattice
Finally observe characterizing Boolean Petri net rather intricate
We begin showing central transition Boolean Petri net set place set transition
Often desirable crisp Boolean Petri net one may possibly explore existence certain sequence enabled transition fire toward initiating completing prescribed process us specified node Boolean lattice
For example design generalized switch used control automatic machine suppose sequence terminal either prescribed denoted zero prescribed denoted unity
It required arrange every one sequence bit corresponding binary appear terminal
Now binary known Hamiltonian sense exists covering cycle one design Hamiltonian switch using crisp Boolean Petri net trigger operation machine exactly successive switching move along prescribed Hamiltonian cycle
The switch design may imagined arbitrary connected graph order connection pair node would mean terminal need turned terminal corresponding may may active state depending machine design
Therefore good characterization Boolean Petri net needed
This problem still open
Many specific class Petri net found
Also many fundamental issue regarding Boolean Petri net emerge study
To keep chapter far possible present necessary definition concept
For standard terminology notation Petri net theory graph theory refer reader Peterson Harary respectively
In chapter shall adopt definition Jenson Petri net In fact represent number arc respectively time referred flow relation
viewed matrix size respectively
The quadruple definition Petri net called Petri net structure
The Petri net graph representation Petri net structure essentially bipartite directed multigraph pair symmetric arc called
As many standard book see Petri net particular kind directed graph together initial marking
The underlying graph Petri net directed weighted bipartite graph consisting two kind node called place transition arc either place transition transition place
No two kind adjacent
Hence Petri net well known graphical representation transition represented box place circle directed arc interconnecting place transition represent flow relation
The initial marking represented placing token shown black dot circle representing place whenever
In general marking mapping
A marking hence represented vector component value number token placed
Let Petri net
A transition said enabled
An enabled transition may may fire depending whether event actually take place
After firing new marking given rule We say fire yield fire write whence said directly reachable
Hence clear meant sequence like simply represents fact transition successively fired transform initial marking terminal marking
The whole sequence transformation also written short called corresponding firing sequence
A marking said reachable exists firing sequence transition successively fire reach state
The set marking Petri net reachable given marking denoted together arc form represents standard terminology called reachability graph Petri net denoted
In particular reachability graph semicycle called reachability tree Petri net
A place Petri net safe number token place never exceeds one
A Petri net safe place safe
The preset transition set input place
The postset set output place
Similarly preset postset respectively
We shall define star Petri net
The notion star graph theory see complete bipartite graph consists exactly one vertex called center joined single edge pendant vertex
degree
A star Petri net obtained subdividing every edge graph every subdividing vertex place node original vertex transition node central node
Further every arc incident central node directed towards every arc incident pendent node directed towards pendent node See
safe star Petri net Proof
We shall prove result using Principle Mathematical Induction PMI
Clearly reachability tree generates binary shown
Next consider star Petri net shown reachability tree displayed
OMath safe star Petri net safe star Petri net OMath It clear binary
We construct follows
Take two copy
In first copy augment vector putting entry second position every marking vector denote resulting labeled tree
Similarly second copy augment vector putting second position every marking let resulting labeled tree See
Augmented reachability tree resulting labeled tree Now using following step construct reachability tree

Clearly set binary disjoint set appearing together contain binary

In transition satisfy enabling condition since violated
So ignore transition stage

In transition enabled marking obtained firing actually whereas augmented vector attached node
So concatenate fusing node labeled node labeled replacing label initial marking

We augment extra pendent node labeled joined new root node labeled new arc labeled complete tree firing transition marking vector nonzero component appear till transition become dead
Then resulting labeled tree shown
This binary node label possibly repetition
It remains show reachability tree initial marking
For consider arbitrary
When transition enabled yield Then get new marking
The marking found
If zero dead marking
Hence suppose
In case enabled next new marking component reduced zero
Eventually process lead dead marking
Further marking vector form already obtained result firing subsequence
Thus T indeed reachability tree Now assume result true star Petri net place
We prove result star Petri net place
For purpose consider two copy reachability tree
In first copy extend vector augmenting entry position let denote resulting labeled tree
Next second copy augment entry position every marking vector let resulting labeled tree
Hence using following step construct reachability tree star Petri net place

Clearly set binary disjoint set appearing together contain binary

In transition satisfy enabling condition
So ignore transition moment

In transition enabled marking obtained firing actually
So concatenate node replaced actual marking initial marking

We augment extra pendent node labeled joined new root node labeled new arc labeled complete tree firing transition marking vector nonzero component appear till transition become dead
In way tree obtained binary node label possibly repetition
It remains show indeed reachability tree binary initial marking
For consider arbitrary
When transition enabled yield Then get new marking
The marking found
If zero dead marking
Hence suppose
In case enabled next new marking component reduced zero
Eventually process lead dead marking
Further marking vector form already obtained result firing subsequence virtue induction hypothesis
Thus precisely reachability tree
Hence result follows PMI
The theorem open general problem determining Petri net also raise question determining optimal Petri net example one ask
Precisely Petri net produce set binary minimum repetition

Precisely Petri net produce binary smallest possible number step
As pointed question could quite important practical application point view

Do exist Petri net generate every binary exactly

Is possible take marking initial marking Petri net
The following proposition theorem answer last two question
Proposition Kansal Singh Acharya If Petri net Boolean
Proof
Suppose Petri net Boolean
By definition Petri net place isolated
Therefore connected
Now three case arise consideration In Case since given Petri net safe
Therefore
either one token token
If one token enabled hence fire
After firing token receive one token
So place one token simultaneously
Hence get marking vector whose component equal
Again token fire whence never receive token contradicts assumption case
Case follows argument given Case since particular
Also Case proof Case implies marking vector whose component equal
Thus Petri net generates binary
one marking vector exactly
Proof
We shall prove result using PMI
Petri net In Petri net total number transition Total number transition whose element transition
Clearly generates binary shown first step step transition becomes dead
Next Petri net shown two place
Petri net The total number transition whose one element transition
The total number transition whose element transition
It clear exactly binary first step step transition become dead
We construct follows Take two copy
In first copy augment vector adjunction entry second coordinate every marking vector denote resulting labeled tree
Similarly second copy augment vector adjunction second coordinate every marking vector let resulting labeled tree see
Augmented reachability tree resulting labeled tree Now using following step construct reachability tree

Clearly binary distinct exactly number

In none transition enabled

In root node marking obtained firing transition
Hence join root node root node arc labeled would become child node obtained firing
Next join child node root node arc labeled would become child node obtained firing
Then resulting labeled tree exactly binary set node
indeed reachability tree transition enabled initial marking fire
Further firing transition new marking obtained rule Next suppose result true
That Petri net transition generating binary exactly structure schematically shown following parameter Petri net place The total number transition whose element transition
The total number transition whose element transition
The total number transition whose element transition The total number transition whose one element transition
The total number transition whose element transition
We prove result Petri net place transition structure shown schematically
For purpose take two copy
In first copy augment vector adjunction entry coordinate every marking vector denote resulting labeled tree
Similarly second copy augment vector adjunction coordinate every marking vector let resulting labeled tree
Now using following step construct reachability tree

The induction hypothesis implies binary distinct exactly number

In none transition enabled

In root node marking obtained firing transition
Hence join root node root node arc labeled would become child node obtained firing child node marking obtained firing transition root node replace arc labeled
Next join remaining child node root node arc labeled respectively would become marking vector obtained firing respectively
Then resulting labeled tree exactly binary
indeed reachability tree transition enabled initial marking fire
After firing new marking obtained rule respectively firing take place enabling condition fails hold marking vector get exactly binary generated exactly first step
It clear Petri net constructed generates binary exactly first step hence smallest number step firing take place step
Hence result follows PMI
Hence shall call Boolean Petri net crisp generates every binary vector exactly
It may observed proof Petri net constructed therein yield binary marking vector least possible number step
Such Boolean Petri net called optimal
The problem characterizing Petri net generating binary marking vector exactly open problem Kansal Singh Acharya
We completely settle part problem determine minimal Petri net minimal sense depth reachability tree minimum possible depth rooted tree defined maximum distance vertex root
In fact show Petri net unique structure
Proof
The existence already established Theorem
We establish uniqueness
Suppose exists Petri net satisfying hypothesis theorem
This implies particular reachability graph isomorphic reachability graph Now need show
Toward end define map satisfying
Clearly bijection
We shall show preserve directed adjacency onto
For consider isomorphism reachability set onto reachability set property denotes set arc digraph case reachability graph corresponding Petri net
As mentioned already Boolean Petri net generating binary marking vector theoretical interest also practical importance
We demonstrate existence disconnected Petri net whose reachability tree homomorphic complete lattice
This make problem characterizing crisp Boolean Petri net appear quite intricate
Definition Given graph homomorphism mean partition two distinct vertex adjacent word independent set
In general given partition necessarily homomorphism partition graph respect denoted graph whose two vertex adjacent whenever exist vertex adjacent whenever
If particular homomorphism called homomorphic image graph homomorphic graph exists homomorphism read isomorphic
Proof
We prove result using PMI number connected component isomorphic
Lattice Next consider
That Petri net consisting two connected component isomorphic shown along reachability tree seen connected acyclic digraph isomorphic complete lattice
Petri net directed reachability tree We construct tactically follows

Take two copy
In first copy augment vector one extra coordinate position right putting entry position denote resulting labeled copy
Similarly second copy augment vector one extra coordinate position right filling denote resulting labeled copy

Take union augment new edge undirected line segment joining pair node whose marking vector unit Hamming distance
Direct edge node represented marking vector fire node whose label marking vector give result firing
Accordingly label arc label
Thus directed arc labeled join every node exactly one node bijective manner shown
In way see resulting discrete structure node correspond binary vector
Clearly nothing reachability tree seen connected acyclic digraph
Augmented lattice resulting complete lattice place Next consider
That Petri net consisting three connected component isomorphic shown
In three transition enabled
Petri net place complete lattice Hence firing transition successively get marking vector respectively first step
Right fix direction orthogonal
Further transition enabled
After firing successively get marking vector respectively
Subsequently firing give marking vector respectively whereas firing give marking vector
On continuing process firing next third step get marking vector transition enabled
So reachability tree isomorphic complete lattice seen connected acyclic digraph
We construct follows

Take two copy
In first copy augment vector one extra coordinate position extreme right putting entry position denote resulting labeled copy
Similarly second copy augment vector one extra coordinate position extreme right filling denote resulting labeled copy

Take union augment new edge undirected line segment joining pair node whose marking vector unit Hamming distance
Direct edge node represented marking vector fire node whose label marking vector give result firing
Accordingly label arc label
Thus directed arc labeled join every node exactly one node bijective manner shown
In way see resulting discrete structure node correspond binary vector
Clearly nothing reachability tree seen connected acyclic digraph
Augmented lattice resulting complete lattice Hence let u assume result true
That Petri net consisting connected component isomorphic isomorphic reachability tree seen connected acyclic digraph
Now prove result true
Note transition enabled unit vector

Take two copy
In first copy augment vector one extra coordinate position extreme right putting entry position denote resulting labeled copy
Similarly second copy augment vector one extra coordinate position extreme right filling denote resulting labeled copy

Take union augment new edge undirected line segment joining pair node whose marking vector unit Hamming distance
Direct edge node represented marking vector fire node whose label marking vector give result firing
Accordingly label arc label
It enough show indeed isomorphic reachability tree seen connected acyclic digraph
Towards end consider set Clearly subdigraph induced whose node labeled vector subdigraph induced whose node labeled vector
Every arc labeled one transition way two index orthogonal parallel direction according whether thus Step induction hypothesis arc respectively represents one transition fired accordance firing rule yielding next state marking vector previous state marking vector unit Hamming distance former
Now Step edge joining pair node whose marking vector unit Hamming distance directed way resulting arc represents firing new transition node represented marking vector reachability tree yielding node reachability tree whose label marking vector give result firing
Accordingly label arc label
Since two marking vector interconnected arc labeled scheme follows every arc labeled initial node terminal node signifying fact fire initial node yield next state marking vector belongs
Further two arc common node whence say independent
Also every node joined unique node Hamming distance one arc labeled bijective way therefore number arc
Next consider node labeled
The arc incoming node node unit Hamming distance labeled elementary coordinate vector hence corresponding arc labeled
Consequently transition become dead node labeled zero vector marking vector
The foregoing argument imply indeed represents reachability tree connected acyclic digraph invoking PMI
Now arbitrary positive integer construct partition reachability tree defining part subset node letting denotes Hamming distance vector dimension
Clearly general denote number way object selected given object
Now consider mapping assigns node marking vector derived sequence transition fired starting initial marking vector specified unique path root vertex whose marking vector
Hence consider refinement defined follows For let Then clearly form partition set
It may easily verified two marking vector adjacent whence homomorphism
Further homomorphic image arc arc marking vector marking vector
This completes proof
In theorem shown fixing sequence transition Petri net firing tactfully one produce complete Boolean lattice homomorphic image reachability tree
One perhaps produce many interesting result like instance getting vertex regular polyhedron term marking vector using analysis Boolean circuit given property
This raise another new question characterize Petri net whose reachability tree given property
Note given Petri net order reachability tree arbitrary binary vector root essentially finite cf
Nauber node labeled function vertex set Boolean complete lattice possibly repetition marking vector
Consider Hamming distance partition defined letting
Then refinement homomorphism connected sublattice
Thus lead problem determining Petri net whose reachability tree homomorphic given sublattice
First question whether arbitrarily given connected sublattice exists Petri net whose usual reachability tree homomorphic
We conjecture answer question affirmative
Next given connected sublattice let denote set Petri net order whose reachability tree homomorphic
Let denote set pairwise nonisomorphic connected sublattices
Clearly partition set Petri net order
In word Petri net one set equivalent sense dynamic two accordance given connected sublattice thus enough pick one option choose required one per practical constraint
We discus necessary sufficiency condition Petri net Boolean
Lemma If Petri net Boolean
Proof
Suppose
Since see
This mean exists least one place
Further since Boolean Proposition therefore every transition enabled
In particular enabled
After firing place receive token contradicts fact Petri net
Hence
Lemma If Petri net Boolean
Proof
Since generates binary generates marking vector type Hamming distance initial marking vector
These marking vector obtained first step firing marking vector whose Hamming distance initial marking obtained marking vector whose Hamming distance greater equal initial marking
These marking vector generated every place exist distinct transition say
Hence
Lemma If Petri net Boolean incidence matrix contains identity matrix order submatrix
Proof
Since Boolean Proposition
Again generation binary vector type Hamming distance initial marking also generated
These vector obtained first step firing shown Lemma
Therefore exist distinct transition say hence also
Since contains submatrix
Lemma If Petri net Boolean exists least one transition
Proof
Suppose hypothesis exist every
Since
Then Lemma
Then number token remains one throughout dynamic state
This implies vector would never occur marking vector contradiction hypothesis
Therefore lemma follows contraposition
Now study necessary sufficient condition Petri net generates binary marking vector

The incidence matrix contains submatrix
Proof
Necessity This follows Proposition Lemma Lemma
Sufficiency Given hypothesis condition claim Boolean
Since
This implies
Since contains submatrix
Also
Therefore transition enabled fire
After firing get distinct marking vector whose Hamming distance initial marking vector
At new marking vector transition enabled give least distinct marking vector whose Hamming distance initial marking
Therefore set new vector contains least new distinct binary vector
In general stage get set least new distinct binary whose Hamming distance initial marking also distinct set distinct marking vector
Therefore stage would obtained least distinct binary
Together initial marking thus see binary would obtained marking vector possibly repetition
Proof
Necessity Since generates binary binary whose Hamming distance initial marking
They number
Since vector obtained
This implies least distinct transition say
After firing become dead
Further also binary whose Hamming distance
These vector number obtained exist least distinct transition
In general least distinct transition yield binary Hamming distance
Sufficiency Since transition enabled fire
After firing become dead
This implies matrix order matrix get constructed follows
By hypothesis least distinct transition say firing generate binary exactly one zero assume arc
Thus place transpose binary first matrix
Next hypothesis distinct transition say
Since become dead firing must generate distinct binary exactly two zero
Hence transpose vector placed column matrix immediately previous column
We thus enabled hypothesis construct submatrix order contains distinct binary last column zero
We may augment initial column either extreme left extreme right
Let augmented submatrix column
That mean one repetition column
Thus see Petri net generates binary marking vector
Strong Chain Cycle exists least one transition outside
Proof
Necessity Suppose Petri net SCC covering place Boolean
In part statement theorem let
Then
Since SCC get one token place
So get binary contradiction hypothesis
In part theorem since generates binary marking vector
This vector obtained transition virtue Lemma
We claim transition belong
Suppose single arc symmetric arc
This mean
This implies contradiction assumption
Therefore belong SCC
Sufficiency Since transition belonging enabled fire
After firing give distinct binary whose Hamming distance since vector exactly remaining transition enabled fire
After firing get least distinct marking vector whose Hamming distance second stage firing binary exactly two zero
In third stage least distinct marking vector obtained firing obtained second stage vector contains exactly three zero
Continuing manner stage get least distinct marking vector containing exactly zero firing obtained stage
Since range thus obtain least equal distinct vector
Since distinct well zero vector obtained due hypothesis exists transition outside
Thus see distinct binary generated
Lemma Let Petri net let SCC pass place
Then Petri net obtained deletion self loop belonging generates binary
Proof
First note removal result Petri net transition
Now SCC Theorem Boolean hence nothing prove
Hence without loss generality may assume given Petri net SCC say
We shall prove result invoking PMI
First let
Then contain SCC therefore
Further easy verify generates binary namely shown
Petri net place Next let
Then contains following structure shown
Here
Petri net place Since enabled fire
After firing get marking vector
Since fire simultaneously get marking vector
At stage enabled firing give marking vector
Hence obtain marking vector procedurally taking two marking vector obtained previous case namely follows

Augment second position corresponding case vector

In case fire firing get marking vector respectively
Next take assume validity procedure get binary

Augment marking vector right end get

In case fire firing get marking vector
By induction hypothesis marking vector applied obtain binary marking vector firing stage coordinate
Further binary fired using obtain binary form distinct obtained
Together therefore obtained binary marking vector
Thus proof follows PMI
The following frustration theorem due negative fact reveals effect one hope forbidden subgraph characterization Boolean Petri net
Every Petri net embedded induced subnet Boolean Petri net
Proof
Let Petri net
If Boolean Petri net nothing prove
Hence assume Boolean Petri net
Then following step obtain Boolean Petri net one induced subnets
First find place whose postsets single distinct sink transition postset place one distinct sink transition choose one transition giving
Suppose place
If sink transition augment one sink transition place
Augment new transition join remaining place arc place new transition creating new active transition
Thus subgraph
Since transition enabled
Firing transition forming pendant transition produce distinct binary whose Hamming distance initial marking vector
At marking vector transition transition enabled firing give least distinct marking vector whose Hamming distance initial marking
In general stage get set least new distinct binary whose Hamming distance initial marking also distinct set distinct marking vector
Therefore stage would obtained least distinct binary
Together initial marking thus see binary would obtained marking vector possibly repetition
Thus Boolean
Therefore every Petri net embedded induced subgraph Boolean Petri net
Precisely Petri net generate binary marking vector Boolean Petri net
This hotly pursued research problem
We shown chapter necessary sufficient condition characterize Boolean Petri net containing SCC
However general problem characterizing Petri net contain SCC strong chain still open
A Petri net containing SCC strongly connected sense two node mutually reachable
However converse true underlying digraph Petri net strongly connected need contain SCC
So even characterization strongly connected Boolean Petri net open problem
Further general characterizing crisp Boolean Petri net open
If relax condition depth reachability tree original definition minimality minimal crisp Boolean Petri net require instead number enabled transition kept minimum possible reachability graph Petri net may underlying graph structure isomorphic whence would tree order
Since would finite number determination structure Petri net enumeration would potential practical interest
It involves orienting tree order general theoretical purpose tree order admit orientation edge make reachability tree minimal safe crisp Boolean Petri net
As pointed many fundamental issue regarding Boolean Petri net emerge study
For example found established reachability tree Petri net homomorphically mapped complete Boolean lattice thereby yielding new technique represent dynamic Petri net
One expect bring near future salient feature Petri net general part theory likely emerge even work

He may also explore inference may drawn regarding reaction rate possibly assistance statistical mechanic
The formal kineticist hand take macroscopic viewpoint primitive concept elementary reaction
This defined set stoichiometric coefficient together rule relating reaction rate composition temperature
The primary macroscopic observable rate change composition mixture expression constructed adding rate elementary reaction weighted corresponding set stoichiometric coefficient
The elementary reaction thus provide framework constructing differential equation satisfied composition
The familiar idea mass action kinetics extended embrace situation general chemically reacting mixture closed vessel
Thus example many reaction region connected convective diffusive mass transport cellular aggregate biological tissue drawn common mathematical scheme
The idea chemical thermodynamics algebraic nature equilibrium condition decreasing property free energy also generalized natural way possible identify class generalized kinetic expression ensure consistency extended thermodynamic condition
The principal result work show exists simply identifiable class kinetic expression including familiar detailed balanced kinetics proper subclass ensure consistency extended thermodynamic condition
For kinetics class call complex balanced kinetics exotic behavior bistability oscillation precluded domain search kinetic expression type behavior considerable biological interest greatly narrowed
It also shown idea complex balancing detailed balancing closely related symmetry time reversal
This paper say fundamental reference stochastic network analysis When go beyond case reaction network deficiency zero meet interesting behavior rate equation important biochemistry
Examples include periodic solution serve biological clock multiple stable equilibrium stoichiometric subspace serve switch living organism
The latter phenomenon called bistability
For bistability see example Abstract bifurcation theory one widely used approach analysis dynamical behaviour chemical biochemical reaction network
Some interesting qualitative behaviour analyzed oscillation bistability situation system least two coexisting stable equilibrium
Both phenomenon identified central feature many biological biochemical system
This paper using theory stoichiometric network analysis SNA notion algebraic geometry present sufficient condition reaction network display bifurcation associated phenomenon
The advantage condition impose fewer algebraic condition model parameter condition associated standard bifurcation theorem
To derive new condition coordinate transformation made guarantee existence branch positive equilibrium system
This particularly useful mathematical biology positive variable value considered meaningful
The first part paper extended introduction SNA algebraic method used coordinate transformation set theorem
In second part paper focus derivation bifurcation condition using SNA algebraic geometry
Conditions derived three bifurcation bifurcation simple branching point linked bistability simple Hopf bifurcation
The latter linked oscillatory behaviour
The condition derived sufficient extend earlier result stoichiometric network analysis found Aguda Clarke J Chem Phys Clarke Jiang J Chem Phys Gatermann et al

In paper necessary condition two bifurcation given
A set example illustrate algebraic condition arising given sufficient bifurcation condition difficult interpret harder calculate arising necessary bifurcation condition
Hence increasing amount information gained extra computational cost

In MCC neither use symmetry method
For method performance volatile black box scenario implemented MCC
NOTE associated main version three variant described Variant This variant us goal oriented stubborn set method linear algebraic state compression
Goal oriented stubborn set perform best reachability query ultimately satisfied net investigation
A heuristic take care satisfying state reached high probability already early stage state space exploration
This way tiny portion state space actually explored
If satisfying state missed however satisfying state reachable significantly larger state space produced one produced
Witness path tend small
Variant In addition use bloom filter internal representation state
That hash value state marked several hash table belonging independent hash function
The state stored
This way handle larger number state within given amount memory
In rare case hash collision colliding state explored part state space may missed false negative result possible
The user specify number hash table used thus control probability hash collision
Variant This variant computes stubborn set using standard deletion algorithm
Deletion algorithm much slower stubborn set quadratic instead linear yield better reduction
This better reduction pay whole state space need explored
reachable satisfying state
If reachable state exist variant outperformed optimistic variant since heuristic tends miss reachable state early phase state space exploration
Witness path often much longer optimistic variant

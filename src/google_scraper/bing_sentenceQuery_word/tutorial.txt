course Java programming beginner
It cover fundamental programming roughly material covered beginning programming course university high school AP Computer Science course
For maximum benefit go though interactively thinking answering question bottom page
There page per chapter
If spend minute per page chapter take minute longer copy run program
If beginning programmer plan spending month
These Notes assume recent version Java available Oracle text editor Notepad
Compiling running program done command line interface
You may use sophisticated environment well
check A German translation done Heinrich Gailer available
A French translation selected chapter available Here nice site unrelated site allows practice Java programming line
Another nice site unrelated site allows run Java program directly browser
An alternate site faster response time contains material Best viewed x higher
The audio work best Windows Media Player

Learning computer science one enjoyable experience human life also one frustrating
You came across page either want learn computer science want learn computer science want computer science job
Whatever motivation computer science may seem like witchery
Geeks use overly complicated jargon explain concept
A friend mine Michelle Bu novice programmer way noted programmer perpetual competition see claim thing You want join club know get
Joining world like trying take castle butter knife
I remember first lesson computer science
I tried learn program googling How In hindsight futile search result either encompassing vague technical detailed
I went ask computer science friend
It went something like Me I want learn program
Can teach program Friend Sure
Let start variable
A variable store value
There different type variable
A int variable store integer long variable store larger integer Me Hold
What
Back
What difference int long Friend One store integer one store bit Me What store mean Friend It put value memory Me What memory location Friend The memory location information Me That help memory location
And decide store Friend Well compiler program run creates memory address memory
When variable name reference value
The compiler look memory Me Huh
What compiler Friend Don worry
Just remember int store bit integer long store bit That unhelpful
Asking simple question like What difference ints longs unravels others question computer science
It like trying behead hydra
Chop one head come back head
Before know instructor trying stitch head back would shut
I want anyone scared experience like
Some fortunate support I I learning computer science long shied away
Computer science fun
In opinion one truest expression self
It best ability innovate create
It like playing God
Sure mess bunch time part excitement whatever create
This guide lengthy really break several manageable part read come back often feel lost get stuck
It meant comprehensible intention bestow much knowledge I
To learn computer science must break process learning three hierarchical form learning abstraction fine tuning
Many guide focus one aspect without giving overarching understanding fine tune implementation
Your learning learning objective broken general strategy helpful tactic tool acquisition
Strategies overarching principle studying computer science
In section I covering necessary infrastructure learning
These concept cover topic like seek help ask question set environment learning debug
Tactics strategy tackling computer science problem
Problems different exercise sense know go solving problem
An exercise would something like power
Even though difficult exercise would know exactly solve
A problem hand ambiguous presentation
You may see problem know solve
It creates mystery sense helplessness many also creates wonder excitement like challenge
Of course everyone different boundary define problem exercise
Some may consider question problem whereas others would consider exercise
Learning tactic building arsenal tool tackling new problem
Computer science filled fun challenging problem take
In section I teach favorite method tackle new challenge
Tools kind thing people think think computer science
Knowing Ruby understanding How design greedy algorithm thing consider tool
Tools help thing computer science
You learn tool journey computer science
Learning tool tackling problem use slightly different approach come learning share lot common term learning
Tools entail syntax language data structure anything concrete understanding something
Often solved problem acquired tool solve similar problem
Maybe hash table recursion worry understand term right learned study
Tools least important concept three matter many tool acquire know strategy tactic know improvise forever stay novice
As may see strategy important topic learning computer science followed tactic followed tool
In fact I put little emphasis tool
I point tool acquire acquire I go much material
Everyone moment self doubt journey towards learning computer science
It okay
It completely natural feel way time
To help counter journey must understand journey u
Here map There three stage understanding used model learning path
At beginning everyone call apprentice
The main role apprentice mimic
They copy master master sometimes without much questioning
During stage learning beginner learn following exercise teacher tell teacher flexible entity could book tutorial actual teacher
If teacher throw material said learn flounder sink like rock
You overwhelmed material discouraged monumental challenge
So instead learn structure
However bit time feel comfortable material well sort
You feel comfortable tiny realm mimicry
Apprentices learn fairly quick rate hit first peak
Afterwards graduate artisan
Instead following best practice artisan learn improvise
All sudden template copy anymore
Sometimes even correct solution
The training wheel safety net gone creates sense frustration loss
Good programmer get trench
They struggle tremendously late night obsession lack sleep minor depression rigor
The push past ceiling trench
Then plateau
They either become comfortable continue hone skill sometimes believe getting anywhere
In considerable time become master
Like learning path guide broken three stage
Tools main approach used apprentice phase tactic take dominant role learning artisan phase
Strategies although guarantee mastery essential part helping reach
This path fractal nature well describes general learning path also learning path learning new
concept well
Understand journey ease anxiety nervousness initial failure
If ever feel journey
Don give remember frustration currency progress dedication price pay successful student
Let talk strategy
Many people afraid learning program know go learning computer science strategically
They know start go language pick know knowing know
Knowing tackle new learning endeavor strategically mean directed effort towards learning goal
I think could take away one lesson guide learning would get started early possible
It matter learn le inefficient manner know going
As long know whatever heading right direction best option go
If still lot unanswered question computer science like programming language I start learning What tutorial best learning X push aside question get started
Many answer find along way
People tend fall analysis paralysis
They read computer science purchase programming book read guide like one formulate lifelong plan study computer science never write single line code
If ever find state find actionable step take direction goal take
I even make decision follow The Roadmap bottom
It best get destination
Your first priority like every beginner first priority take first step
So jump
Come join world computer science fun lost
Author Tim Cahill book Jaguars Ripped My Flesh quoted The explorer person I big fan online learning
I take online course Coursera Udacity Edx time
As much I would love urge everyone sign class away people part community important grasping understanding computer science
Not collaboration important learning computer science crucial work industry everyone computer science industry collaborates one another
I think important figure following role complete satisfying learning journey
Forming community beyond encounter
It regularly seeing meeting interacting people
Having strong community necessarily large make learning journey much easier directed frankly fun
Have mentor
You want someone better computer science explain answer question may
Having person call extremely important time trying find answer online book fruitful
You frustrated angry feel helpless
You need someone help
You need someone listen problem answer question someone shoe understands hardship
Not answer technical question also answer broader question like I want build robot drive I study I quite sure I learn Their experience provide curriculum rather provide direction insight
Really try find patient understanding teacher
It better find someone poorer mastery subject explain understanding clearly find someone computer genius would scoff dumb question
This crucial
I seen many ambitious computer science beginner give pursuit computer science met someone answer question demean mentees asking dumb question extinguish flame curiosity
Find someone brings best really trust wisdom
Also preferably find someone know person meet person
Best case scenario mentor already friend
Worst case lack friend know computer science
If know acquaintance even stranger ask help flattered
If school look teacher assistant class
If still fruitless check see local programming group local university
If hopeless check forum learning computer science
Often find wide supporting community although never paramount meeting
If UC Berkeley student mentor message
Another important person learning community finding someone around level expertise
I find process discussing computer science concept another human extremely rewarding term building meaningful relationship learning computer science
Your peer teach encourage help effectively
I know many traveler give learning become uncomfortable lost world computer science
Having fellow nomad make journey speedier pleasant
A peer help tackle problem
Although may seem like slacking divvy work learning interaction increase exponentially
Interacting peer help discus different perspective problem solving tactic particular problem
In many academic subject especially computer science different approach tackling problem
By exposing different approach method understanding concept solving exercise understand material hand thoroughly
Vocalization thought also help solve problem even lost
In computer science often called The Rubber Ducky Debugging Tool debugging methodology explain bug problem rubber duck thereby understanding problem bit better
Why use rubber duck human understanding responsive human much better
Beyond realm problem set peer also bring culture classroom everyday life important one would think
Often I remark humorous computer science joke normal conversation help understand concept lot better
If competitive nature like I understand peer keep track progressing individual goal
They challenge perform best encourage fall behind peer well make damn sure worthy competitor challenge well
Find learning peer work well
Being friend important let become distracting guy study work together
Find someone driven learn computer science still patient ahead like helping problem set even finish
Availability crucial learning buddy expected meet regularly peer
Although strictly necessary really want solidify understanding concept generally closing gap understanding find someone worse computer science
By able explain idea clearly simply truly demonstrate world understand concept
You also give back community helped journey
Having community consist people fulfill role important often first failure point beginner
Without right type support student struggle unnecessary hardship
The chain command I follow come answering question go following Before I look help anywhere I tend try exhaust problem solving toolkit tool
I look tool tactic I teach Tactics see tool tactic solve
I explore path tactic evaluate current standing try different path
I move next chain command I exhausted possibility tool
Finding answer without trying answer question rob insight
You trouble remembering context problem nature problem constructed understand naturally lack complete understanding solution
After I come fruitless trying solve problem I leverage help internet
I google
StackOverflow best website answering programming question
I try come clean right terminology read several search result try find I looking
I give much advice
Many people know Google expertise come practice
Now lost usually know right terminology obscure question find peer pool together insight
If afraid bothering people like I still remember peer benefit solving problem much asking question situation consider well people ask help
Working problem peer create sounding board insight
It cumulative collective knowledge power collaboration
It help tremendously
I always ask help presenting problem accurately easy possible state exactly getting stuck approach I taken far tackling issue
It facilitate open communication common understanding problem
Ask voice thought loud
Their interpretation problem initial reaction thought
Then ask plan extracting information problem solve
Take thought jumbled mess confused rephrase back understand going
Point obstacle discus get around
If still lost point time go ask mentor
To maintain good relationship mentor regularly meet even specific question
Mentors still friend talk
It also equally important big burden mentor
Everyone patience finite rely mentor carry way soon find
Ask question ask question context
There dumb question prepared question unprepared question
An example prepared question although may dumb How variable Python work
I trying understand list stored memory
I tried Googling read article language I still quite understand Asking question context demonstrates several point mentor Asking good question help sustain good relationship mentor
Make sure thank mentor every time help
Before I take new learning endeavor first strategy always try find cheap way experiment
Richard Feynman Nobel Prize winner Physics always advocated opportunity play experiment thing learning
In computer science mean writing code subsequently debugging
Having debugging tool allows u better peer program see going
If know debug code know tool order robbing great tool teacher
If wondering debugging tool mean asking right question
In programming language I learn class I take I seek answer question right bat Let say taking algorithm class instead writing code algorithm learned theory
No way testing whether work
How confident would write algorithm learned class internship
Therefore learning anything first question I verify I taught true In chemistry lab test tube mathematics proof
In computer science computer code
Setting computer write run code like setting chemistry lab run experiment
You need right equipment right litmus test right ingredient
You perhaps download certain software editor
Whatever learning try find convenient way able write test code
Get text editor I started actually switched I got Macbook
Now going many different faction programmer telling best
They tell Vim best stay true Emacs
Whatever say ignore
Having functional editor method around optimality please please let best editor decision prevent writing code
That probably stupidest failure point one journey learning computer science
Pick one move
You always switch later
Find error handled code
Different programming language different way handling error
Some programming language silent error others tell exactly fucked
Sometimes error ignored time break whole program even crash computer
Knowing know error produced help know going know messed fix problem learn
Ask mentor get stuck say What program I bug
How I know whether I bug I generally try find print thing inside code
Usually something called print statement
In Python print Your Message Here
In Java Your Message Here
In Javascript completely different language Java way Your Message Here
My first job learning print thing onto computer whether output terminal browser
Once know print thing debugging much easier
You able tell value certain variable certain point program value put function exactly code among thing
Print statement get way debugging tool may vary programming language programming language
I would generally quick Google search see debugging ask mentor
Computer science educational subject requires deliberate practice application
It need practice application get computer science education
Deliberate practice includes problem set homework
It process solidifies understanding particular concept tool
Application hand solidifies connection solving problem
In deliberate practice problem seeking solution
In application solution preparing right problem come
Let demonstrate mean example
Let say trying learn recursion intro computer science class
Your instructor give assignment maybe even project help solidify understanding recursion
It involves calculating factorial number among problem recursion difficult
You complete assignment Yes I learned recursion Yes learned recursion
You know enough pas test know tested
But know whether recursion could help solve problem encounter summer internship
You least easily conceivable
If someone gave question month later How I count number way make dollar coin would know recursion right way go
Well sure occur many beginner answer YES
That I believe seeking problem solve learned concept would strengthen understanding concept well put right connection cue would trigger Recursion
Recursion
You solve recursion head
Well would systematically go applying understanding
There several way
The first finding personal project
Find problem need solving ask often possible Can I solve using concept I learned If tackle
Make second nature recognize tool useful
At club I involved Hackers Berkeley use concept learn class workshop online tackle challenge always wanted solve
Hence produce best computer science student one join one become Thiel Fellows land fantastic job internship great company
Metacognition
After complete problem set take minute two examine nature problem presented
Ask Usually form problem presented Find pattern occur among problem encountered past
For recursion might think Well recursion problem presented act building complexity simple Therefore see problem seem grand nature know think recursion
Developing hunch greatly helpful problem solving really keeping computer science education past class
That I really strategy
Building community able find answer developing right habit really thing need great computer scientist
You make commitment
Tactics method tackling new problem
The difference great problem solver normal student even though party stuck new problem great problem solver rarely idle stare problem
Usually making form discovery testing form conjecture
They always avenue discover new concept behind problem new pattern
Always discovering always progressing
Having good tactic solving problem help learn faster also give edge tackling new problem
There inherent appeal computer science curiosity always fulfilled
Unlike subject like biology chemistry need lab financial accounting need year experience management let handle money computer science need discover something new laptop
That mother tool getting hand dirty
Experimentation always yield fruitful result understanding computer science
I explain concept Getting Your Hands Dirty GYHD using famous example used Paul Zeitz book video course The Art Craft Problem Solving Q A knock door asks woman inside many child old
I three daughter age whole number product age say mother
That enough information responds
I tell sum age still I wish tell something Okay older daughter Annie like Of course first look would stumped
What
I first thought There way I could extract new information I decided give regret I paid attention spent time trying solve
I gotten hand dirty
A Some may picked hint get hand dirty
Well let
Let list product product
They listed Many would still stumped let take GYHD step list sum least know answer one choice
You quickly find two option sum
Those two two pair ambiguity exist
If woman daughter age telling sum would NOT stumped census taker two possibility
As bonus treat riddle figure answer correct notice mother say Older daughter mean exists oldest The age daughter must
We would never arrived answer know possible solution outset
We would never know dug little deeper explored little see information current information provide
In computer science particularly test technical interview often asked solve problem quickly us le time efficiently us le memory
A tip Cracking Coding Interview Gayle Laakmann suggests come best solution come le ideal solution
Why
Because often question difficult enough see best answer right away
Having stepping stone le ideal solution crucial reaching final destination
Many question series stepping stone
Usually easiest conceive called Brute Let example demonstrate thought process go solving question
I modified problem make understandable CS beginner
Q If given tile numbered shuffled bag duplicate number bag giving number find duplicate number efficiently
For sake people understand time complexity space complexity I simplify objective question
Time Complexity How many mathematical operation must
Space Complexity How many tile remembered give point
Let say remember tile lay table
Well let try styled answer
Well definition duplicate mean already occurring
Let take letter one one one take compare tile laid table lay table
If find duplicate stop
Although solves problem correctly always give u correct answer task finding duplicate inefficient
Every tile take comparison last one
If duplicate last time would done comparison taking space
Let try better
For bag number tile N duplicate making N comparison N space
You notice since number occurs except duplicate must one space number tile
So draw square grid table tile take place exactly tile
mean column row
So forth
You stop place tile onto square
Now always take space place tile guaranteed find solution try
Let see even better
Now see anything special
Well notice sum always stay matter scrambled always add
Whatever duplicate plus duplicate number
So take piece paper
Every time take tile add tile number number paper
Then chuck tile away
Do tile left number
Subtract number given duplicate want
Since even care order anymore relied sum remember one number time sum number
The number computation always number number save whole lot space without keep track many number
It hard see perfect solution get go
Nothing would prompted anyone inexperienced add everything subtract
Only using stepping stone solution getting hand dirty could reached satisfactory point
So get hand dirty
Do providing example example succeed example fail
Provide solution solution fail solve problem solution solve problem solution solve problem effectively
Learn attempt
Simplification come two form simplification problem simplification example
Simplification method edging closer solution finding tangible pattern problem
Actionable simplification help come good pattern help problem solve
I fantastic professor discrete mathematics Shoutout Professor Sahai UCB gave u difficult question solve instead harsh resentful type professor rewarded partial credit student solve simplified form question
He said lecture If solve problem try taking condition away original problem solve easier one
Once solved start adding back condition back see fails examine thing fail Sahai Brilliant concept practice type problem solve used time engineering
If go way let go see go Here example simplification problem taken final discrete mathematics class
Q While ﬁghting GLaDOS Chell start origin x plane every second move distance exactly meter direction
The direction independently chosen every second
After n second R Chell distance origin E R
E R expected value distance square also known variance distribution
When I first saw problem I panicked
I know start go
However I resorted simplifying problem helped made significant progress
Let suppose instead choosing uniform direction random could choose direction North East South West
Let solve expected distance original n second
To break choice change x change
Either going move x direction move direction precisely meter
So expected distance x direction one sec variance Var X E X X
In similar fashion variance distance per second also
Since want variance distance origin x also add variance result n expected value
I realized North East South West special case equation Θ Θ Interestingly enough X uniform distribution Θ Likewise By independence Also think unit circle trigonometry
Therefore using linearity expectation It ok understand explanation lot discrete mathematics learn someday
Just remember simplifying problem case helped understand question coherently I took away condition solved easier problem see helped solve complicated version
Q What expected number Facebook friend birthday every single day year
For simplicity sake assume leap year assume friend equal probability distribution land given date
Expected number case restate like Assuming X number friend
There chance X friend occupied every day calendar chance
Find X
Well tough problem tackle
Where even start
Usually people think bottom line got least people right
One every day I go
What never land particular date
Do I calculate chance well
Gahhh
A The answer becomes clear simplify example
Let say one day year want know many friend take occupy year
One course
Well
Well first person could occupy day want long second person
That make chance landing correct date
From geometric series lesson worry know expected outcome take successful outcome p probability desired outcome
Since chance second person different first I flipping coin expected outcome
So take one person occupy date average people occupy day total expected outcome
See going
With day year calculate successive expected value
The first person landing date one landed expected outcome second filled date chance landing square landed expected outcome
The last vacant date need average friend fill
So build inductive step notice pattern therefore way simplify
It seems n day first day second third way
So solution summation term n example turn friend
Often tackling problem head overwhelming
It often easier break problem smaller problem solve smaller problem independently stitch back together either gracefully recognizing pattern among various solution using conditional statement
Here example problem I encountered phone interview I messed badly phone interview I went back several month later problem solving mindset solve
Q Given list interval mathematical function defined another interval called target interval return list interval intersect target interval
Here example Defined interval I want interval target interval It return Really interested bracket space inside bracket
We trying find intersection first second line bracket given interval target interval
On phone interview
I treated every given interval
I tried test one see target interval partly
I messed really badly
I made overly complicated therefore program failed
Here proposed insight answer
A Not bracket
There bracket inside target interval two edge bracket test see partly target interval
Moving left right always unaffected interval middle part result question
Therefore take interval completely inside target interval test interval direct edge encompassed interval see partially intersect target interval
Here pseudocode written solve problem There
Done
I broke interval four case handled case separately
Some tool come handy I provide example
By knowing tactic recognize show strengthen toolkit
When I stuck I ask problem similar problem I solved
I look similar problem reflect I solved
I use insight required solved previously solved problem solve new one
Sometimes I think backwards start solution
I think elusive variable solution manipulate fit condition problem
Of course many many problem solving tactic
I named favorite common one used computer science
You acquire
Some day face problem tackle
You learn solve reflect solved realize Hey I found new approach problem And find joy joy resulting knowing better understanding problem better understanding future problem well
Give pat back
Learning tool often topic focus often least efficiency acquisition
My framework acquire tool adaptation simplification several different source information
Each resource tradeoff notably level mastery amount time commitment
Here two objective relation computer science justify methodology I use
Since focus computer science I focusing adjusting learning style take advantage two thing unique computer science abstraction testability
Abstraction computer science mean many computer science concept terminology abstracted used metaphor
It intuitive subject easy pick could explain popular
The beauty computer science extremely testable
Have question computer science
time easily test
Therefore main focus learning tool Scott Young methodology Holistic Learning
Scott taken year worth MIT computer science course one year passed
Through experience developed framework learning anything
I adapted appended commentary taken personal experience taken framework learning
The focus approach outlined book Young break learning process distinct step
The first step called visceralization
Visceralization process taking something feel unfamiliar becoming familiar
Every new concept learn start unfamiliar relationship concept
It mysterious almost arbitrary poorly understood
To achieve mastery concept must shed light
Tim Ferris author Four Hour Chef would consider stage If concept hard grasp try using several different problem solving tactic simplification
The extreme principle help significantly
See happens take concept limit
If recursion try working backwards end state problem
If equation form algorithm trying plugging extreme value like really large number seeing happens
The extreme principle Paul Zeitz The Art Craft Problem Solving would put reduces degree freedom problem It help lot limit concept take bit bit
Of course application extreme principle form tactic Getting Your Hands Dirty always used learn new tool
If mathematical proof follow proof understand proof derive
If certain concept like recursion understand visually
Use diagram picture sound gesture whatever take get intuitive feel
Claw get frustrated discus mull maybe cry desperation sleep top usually time feel natural
Afterwards build model metaphor
In word take know explain thing
In computer science really easy make metaphor thing
Before take right approach let check wrong approach
Let check formal definition variable Wikipedia defined A storage location associated symbolic name identifier contains known unknown quantity information It might make sense average computer scientist novice mean NOTHING
WTF storage location
Is hard drive
A
Symbolic name
WTF
Are talking hieroglyphic
Unknown quantity
What mean
There coherency adhere
Nothing mind stick
It accurate sure going take serious effort people figure
Now try explanation
A variable like named box put information Before technical geek jump throat please bear least past Exploration section I yard headstart kidding
The explanation continues You box named myName put word James writing Now explanation make much sense
variable like box store information
That make Having metaphor strengthen understanding concept make fun
It novel relationship brings easy understanding
Instead saying A stack type data structure First In Last Out
First last
FIFO FIFO trying drill head remember A stack like pancake You get bottom pancake eat top one
If want extend box analogy imagine stack box
You certainly open bottom box take top one
That actually data structure stack work
You access variable bottom stack pop one
Metaphors fun
They help u remember
You know Reddit subreddit popular
It metaphor concept accessible digestible easy remember
Almost every explanation involves metaphor every ELIAMA IS metaphor
Browse sometime check creative people explaining concept easy remember certain thing well thing fit
Of course metaphor perfect
It even good
That exploration come
In exploration stage test model
You poke model bit see happens
Does collapse
Does stand test
Where metaphor fall
Where shine
The common method exploration problem set
You take belief certain concept use answer question
There find exception thought rule
You find rule thing thought exception
You find inconsistency model learn fix model sturdy fort
After problem set maybe problem set exploration
Feed curiosity
If followed analogy earlier using box represent variable ask question I provided method test find answer
They exhaustive
There way answer explore question course come new one You find putting really large number variable
You ask someone would happen
You many box check computer memory space
You google
Preferably ask friend
Try assigning variable name different thing printing computer
Do original item new one
Do
Then ask question Is true item put What put rope tied another box
I answer right pointer reference
You try answer assigning two variable A B respectively
If say mean putting thing another box metaphor mean put box B box See happens print print B ERROR
Just question I tell print Then ask Well case box B box A Did box B transfer box A Then print box B content
Phew seems like box transfer content box A
The first question may able answer conventional programming Google ask someone
There many question ask metaphor box describe variable
Jumping back metaphor second student would conceived question beforehand imagined visualized variable named box
The student would fumbled around figuring variable exactly without allowing curiosity guide exploration
These example question legitimate question variable whether form formal terminology language metaphor
They dumb question
If metaphor help student understand concept think better mean use metaphor
By end one question pretty special type box metaphor one point encapsulated understand subject enough need metaphor anymore
Use opportunity create favorite metaphor
Your metaphor keep
It like inside joke
You able see concept learning much clearer
You able enjoy constructing sound metaphor bulletproof
Then able tell friend peer Hey I realized array like vending provide reasonable argument
All right right
I drop wisdom
Since reading guide trying learn methodology I use really Scott Young system teach system
Ok Learning concept like playing Pokemon
First catch Pokemon
The process catching pokemon process visceralization
You see claw poke deconstruct encapsulate pokeball
Once basic model
You take pokemon train nurture
You feed scoop poop despite fact might still take bed sleeping bag
You learn skill shortcoming stats
You work spend time
Ok ok take pokemon test
In tribute generation pokemon Pewter Gym Brock gym
Then say Go Pikachu
Fight Onix If defeat leader great
You earned badge mastered concept
If train pokemon try
If pokemon model fails many time maybe time let go
Maybe took try realize Onix impervious electric type Pokemons
So let go Pikachu pick new pokemon preferably Squirtle try
By time defeat gym leader fantastic new Pokemon neat badge show awesome online course badge day
They probably caught
Below roadmap based personal computer science learning journey UC Berkeley computer science curriculum
It based semester really mean much besides general chronological order thing You learn basic programming concept well dip foot world programming
I find Learn Python Hard Way best teaching semester
Use checklist make sure learn concept
Don move concept Python encapsulated learn data structure
Java better way go
I find UC Berkeley best way go
You find resource material exercise class
You implement thing take granted Semester Java
Email I even try get Piazza group live support community UCB student taking class super duper helpful people keeping track
Here semester checklist Also discrete math provides mathematical backing computer science education
Also really necessary I find helpful building repertoire problem solving tool tactic
Checklist With knowledge end second semester could probably score basic internship summer time
If lost suppose go semester general sense step take next
So I give roadmap proudly call computer scientist
You also license tell corny computer science joke like Q How programmer die shower
A He read shampoo bottle instruction Lather
Rinse
Repeat
If get come back semester treat enjoy I hope guide helpful
Now I must warn guide secret learning computer science
It sunshine rainbow I taught insider trick navigating away difficulty
You hardship
You frustration
You moment look everywhere help even able find
This guide meant teach avoid pain take easy path meant take hard path enjoy adventure
One night probably morning stuck library dorm room problem set due next day
You tired hungry gross feel lost hopeless
But think back guide think warning warning I made You hardship tell Hey ok I frustrated ok I lost
I prepared difficulty happen I began journey computer scientist I prepared Good luck
You succeed believe
I spent hour writing guide including countless hour reading book watching video experimenting learning style technique computer science intern summer
If enjoyed feel free drop line saying thanks
The best email one fundamentally impacted I write reason I write
If question comment concern reach I try best help direct someone
My email My Phone Number My friend said would good idea References listed poorly format
Starred reference material I recommend read want explore strategy accelerated learning
Tim Ferris Robert Greene Scott H Brian Tracy Paul Timothy answered Mark Tor Norrentranders Gayle Laakmann George Tal Used concept write conclusion Thanks interesting started development
This extremely helpful
Thanks James
A Beginner Guide Computer Science James Maa A Beginner Guide Computer Science James Maa Thank much writing guide
Ever since I started journey I hating everyday frustration
After reading I feel much better
I always remember quote You WILL hardship tell Hey ok I frustrated ok I lost
I prepared difficulty happen I began journey computer scientist I prepared Good luck
You succeed believe Thank
No problem
Glad hear helped
Hey James Thank much guide I going start learning computer science goal really really professional guide helpful inspiring thanks Najiba Afghanistan Thanks
Maa rough start coding written A Guide To Computer Science
Coming someone similar experience I I thought interpretation Quite finished reading Jason guide CS blog check clicking link I provided
It clean Thanks
This post awesome well organized
If u add piazza post mentioned would great
Thank sharing wisdom
Really gave first glance I wait starting
What advice would give Junior highschool roughly youve listed semester experience
Besides taking AP comp sci experimenting project program experience reccomend summer Senior year
I live Berkeley know local I know top head definitely try find people interested computer science well
super useful really encouraging
thanks
Thank Tips Guides really appreciate I feel write guide
I wrote already making fundamental guide delve deep You Hey James I brazilian really doubt get started
Your post helped lot motivated lot
Thank
Hey My first semester college Computer Science Engineering start soon coming across post sure great help
I hardly know basic Computer Science help little kickstart get session start
Thanks lot looking forward hear
Dear god
Thank thank thank
I feeling incredibly overwhelmed trying dip toe computer science
Your guide extremely helpful encouraging
Thank taking hour write
Do happen MS Word copy template resume
I really like layout
Thanks Hey Thx start course I Soo lucky come across
Thankyou much
thanks alot Hey James My Name Felipe I really intrsted learning Computer Science
Wat language u recommend begin
Thank posting
I novice computer science I really enjoyed article two reason
First since I working slowly Learning Python Hard Way metaphor explaining concept rang true
Second maybe important I appreciate reading perspective process learning
Maybe lucky meet work people UC Berkeley understand dry technical detail never matter accurate best place start novice subject
I think idea stem prejudice running deep North American culture people learn perhaps even deeper fear making mistake starting small
We disgusted condescend baby step extra large print dull teeming mass unwashed But another excuse bad teaching another excuse student planet give dream
As student I fought idea really weighed teacher I see silly idea pervasive almost every child I work
There truly deep well potential person I really understand faulty idea experience eye today kid knowing potential exists everywhere make reaching like article poignant
Informed source like article make difference digital age almost anyone internet access read inspired act
If embraced education way imagine leap stride u could take alone together
Thanks hard work
I started course I read article gave good understanding importance course career well Thanks article
I starting development blog coding happened something I stumbled upon journey creating site
I obsessed limitless possibility
This article superb detailed I wanted thank writing fueled learn coding
Wish best

The last decade I supervised significant amount PhD student served numerous PhD committee reviewed countless number paper
During occasion I always best give constructive remark lot young someteimes even young researcher acknowledged indeed help becoming better researcher
However year I got nagging feeling I often repeating sometimes wondering whether I sounding like old grumpy grandfather instead active enthusiastic researcher
Worse I often giving tidbit advice noticed overall picture speak lacking
My advice sometimes misunderstood neglected otherwise ignored I often wondered I could nail
During sabbatacil leave University Zürich August January research group I finally presented opportunity develop reference framework
I awfull lot reading several brainstorm end created tutorial entitled Research method Computer Science
This collect material related resource regarding tutorial
Below find recent copy slide used tutorial
This version presented Conference
This tutorial explores role research method computer science drawing upon practical example empirical approach software engineering
After tutorial participant able
This tutorial aimed PhD student want improve research skill
In particular concerned The tutorial Research Methods Computer Science concrete result sabbatical leave University Züurich research group SEAL
Below short chronological overview tutorial evolved current incarnation
After incarnation tutorial I hold little questionnaire among participant
Below analysis response


A process two thread execution running single processor In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within process share resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share instruction executable code context value variable given moment
On single processor multithreading generally implemented CPU switch different
This generally happens frequently enough user perceives thread task running time
On system thread executed true concurrent manner every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously
To implement multiprocessing operating system may use exist method better utilization particular CPU different software thread pure software construct representation
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading
The allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Programs threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort
Threads differ traditional Systems said cheap thread expensive process operating system great difference except cost switch implies TLB flush
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context single process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied single process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread one two way Threads called made early appearance Multiprogramming Variable Number Tasks MVT
Until late CPUs desktop computer much support multithreading although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
In late idea executing instruction multiple thread simultaneously known reached desktop processor name
It dropped architecture later architecture CPUs
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
Edward Lee UC Berkeley A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way
Processes typically preemptively multitasked
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly yield allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel user thread
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor system contend memory bus especially locking fine
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency bug would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map single scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage utilized
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation C provide support threading also provide access native threading APIs provided operating system
Some higher level usually cross platform programming language Java Python expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
A number programming language also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer altogether
Some language designed parallelism
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby implementation Python support threading limitation known GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter concurrently interpreting application code two thread time effectively limit concurrency multiple core system mostly thread much one
Other interpreted programming language Tcl using Thread extension avoid GIL limitation using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation set library call
OS vendor free implement interface wish application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most UNIX platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage certain number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed parallel computation array thread run code parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel utilize GPU architecture

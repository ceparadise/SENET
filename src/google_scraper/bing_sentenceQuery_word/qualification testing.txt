The main entrance qualification UK
Anyone thinking applying opportunity take UK strongly recommended
The UK qualification familiar know rely provide sort training testing tell u applicant suitable degree programme
UK applicant feel would difficult offer style education academic likely find applies degree programme
Therefore anyone take vocational qualification like National Diploma need convince u academic ability equivalent
Some UK applicant well overseas applicant take
We happy accept providing standard academic rigour UK
Comprehensive information UK qualification available UCAS
In many country particularly Commonwealth country possible take UK would recommend route applicant country
This particularly important country high school education finish standard UK
We appreciate applicant full time study involved taking practical
Such applicant may take various Foundation Access course quicker substitute
Our experience standard sort course often variable rarely level completely equivalent
Therefore take small number applicant coming route consider shown exceptionally good performance
The high school leaving certificate European Union country French Baccalaureate German Abitur equivalent standard UK
Therefore applicant taken taking qualification welcome apply use qualification make admission decision
The important thing looking entrance qualification degree programme demonstration logical reasoning skill
Our experience qualification mathematics good indicator
While exception someone poor mathematics unlikely sort ability required success computer science degree someone good mathematics unlikely poor computer science
Therefore whatever qualification taking look mathematics component first
Applicants may surprised find particularly interested qualification information technology
This qualification often use computer application rather skill required design construct
Since degree programme general principle rather specific system also accept commercial certificate provided contributing towards entrance requirement
This knowing incidental detail particular system tend involve little general problem solving reasoning skill
We find many student confuse learning memorisation
In academic computer science little memorised
It much deep understanding surface memorisation
For reason dislike qualification passed viewing memory test
This another reason lack interest many Information Technology qualification since find many centred around memorising regurgitating definition
This useful skill computer scientist
The importance sort skill developed tested mathematics mean choice subject qualification would encourage applicant choose least mathematics
Anyone drop mathematics find difficult dislike also likely find computer science degree difficult enjoy
However applicant dropped mathematics simply realise importance computer science may still willing consider basis subject require mathematical logical reasoning skill
This could include science subject physic
Good performance qualification involving technical side computing could also considered alternative mathematics qualification
Apart mathematics like see evidence good education
Writing communication skill important computer science sense human world around
So particularly welcome applicant combine mathematics qualification art social science
Our current standard offer equivalent point
However subject taken important u accumulation point often express conditional offer term grade
For example may ask point must include grade C full Mathematics grade BCC three full
The important u Mathematics
We consider applicant Computing Maths generally ask grade A Computing case
We may consider applicant taking Maths Computing grade A GCSE Mathematics
Our advice anyone considering applying u future currently deciding take take Maths
A medium grade Maths likely gain entry degree programme higher grade le relevant subject
Apart Maths concerned
One Maths sufficient require advise Further Maths
An ideal choice would one science subject Computing one traditional art subject
The Information Communication Technology ICT Computing
In fact experience ICT weakly related material academic Computer Science degree recommend potential applicant take
Applicants ICT mathematical scientific accepted
We prepared accept General Studies one contributing entrance condition since find good test sort ability require
For example someone taking three taught including Maths plus General Studies may well made offer B Maths plus grade C two taken
Our experience quite easy someone brought household speaks language English gain good grade language without otherwise strong academic skill
We regret therefore count mother tongue contributing towards entrance requirement
We willing accept two subject studied full replacement third
We recommend applicant originally take Maths chance take AS Maths final year university even mean dropping another subject
Our offer always term three equivalent
We recomment student take three taking three confer advantage
If choice module take within Mathematics would prefer Pure Discrete Mathematics module
The Discrete Mathematics module closest sort material encounter degree programme
As mentioned willing consider two subject certified AS level studied full place third
However also possible obtain AS certificate continuing subject full
We would much applicant certify AS stage subject taking full
The AS grade must entered onto UCAS form valuable guide level performance
We regret many school college made policy certify AS level believe hiding u information would valuable helping u guide applicant suitable degree programme
However many school college adopt policy discriminate show u certified AS grade UCAS form
One reason student reluctant certify considering resitting improve grade
We however particularly interested seeing student manage first attempt
If someone obtain particular grade first sitting suggests better aptitude someone obtains grade resitting
The principle applies applicant considering resitting obtain higher grade
We concerned aptitude actual grade resitting mean cramming special tuition passing exam would recommend case original grade obtained probably honest assessment aptitude
We would expect applicant applying retaking obtain higher grade demonstrate original grade really true ability learnt mistake changed attitude led original poor grade
An exception would student genuine personal problem led poor performance
In case would want see preferably UCAS personal statement backed UCAS reference clear detail problem plus assurance resolved
It condition UCAS qualification taken certified entered UCAS form
Applicants retaking enter original grade UCAS form breaking condition reserve right refuse consider application provide u grade
To refuse provide requested information might look bad show dishonest attitude look worse still u
A vocational perfectly acceptable contributing towards UCAS point ask taken alongside Maths
Otherwise would want see high grade grade AB evidence good math skill Maths would good least good GCSE Maths
Without Maths vocational subject consider Information Technology
We accept BTEC National Diploma subject entrance qualification passed high grade
We make conditional offer ask Distinction grade several module taken particularly programming module
As AVCE possibility taking Maths alongside BTEC National Diploma would increase chance considered
We accept BTEC Computing entrance
Although intended equivalent level degree different emphasis mean cover material first second year would necessary enter third year
We require high grade preferably Distinction level HND
We willing consider applicant
However experience course provide sufficient training testing skill pas good chance degree programme
Therefore take small number applicant route generally require Access course pas supplemented factor
For example work experience computer programming overseas qualification
We ask Access course passed many unit possible level
We consider applicant Access course computing mathematics
We ask around point overall International Baccalaureate least point Mathematics
Although consider applicant taking Mathematics Standard level would prefer applicant taking IB take Higher Level Mathematics option
There number private organisation running Foundation Programmes entrance UK university aimed overseas student
Please note Department Computer Science Queen Mary endorse strongly recommends student considering take UK instead
However occasionally take applicant discretion foundation programme involves mathematics standard equivalent UK Mathematics
Many UK university run foundation programme intended applicant meet normal entrance requirement
We consider applicant done well another foundation programme programme lead acceptance Computer Science degree equivalent standard
If lead degree programme lower standard would accept applicant done exceptionally well foundation programme
Applicants university foundation programme must apply UCAS normal way
Queen Mary foundation programme
The Computer Science department however involved programme guarantee place student pas
Students wish considered Computer Science must contact Computer Science department directly
The successful completion first year degree programme another university considered suitable entrance requirement department applicant otherwise lack entrance requirement
We accept enabling direct entrance second year however first year degree Computer Science covering similar range subject similar depth first year
Otherwise may accept qualifying entrance first year
We generally require performance particularly math computer programming unit university
More information transferring Computer Science Queen Mary found
If qualification English language may require proof English level sufficient able follow degree programme
An acceptable proof would pas level pas point
Our UCAS conditional offer may sometimes include requirement
Amongst common overseas qualification requirement around When filling UCAS form please give name qualification country
Do describe using UK equivalent GCSE would regard claiming take UK qualification named would truth
In general follow advice given UCAS regarding equivalence overseas qualification UK qualification must leave final judgement u assume
If qualification involves separate mark individual module component please list qualification obtained qualification yet completed
This enable u make accurate judgement suitability degree programme
Because degree programme academic nature accept maturity substitute formal entrance qualification
We require applicant age qualification showing mathematical ability
We may accept applicant slightly lower grade equivalent qualification taken year ago previously used university entrance recognition skill obtained maturity
However work experience take account directly compensation lack suitable entrance qualification employment computer programmer
Even case expect applicant qualification university entrance standard
Mature applicant relevant work experience without qualification recommended take
Mature applicant neither relevant work experience qualification recommended take Maths preferably one basis full time study possible
Under circumstance consider applicant fewer normal three
We running competition web prize place Computer Science degree fee paid maintenance grant
The winner require minimal qualification needed entrant University London two grade E equivalent
Runners may also offered entry lower normal grade

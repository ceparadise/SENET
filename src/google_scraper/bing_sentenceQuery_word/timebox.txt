discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

CaSandra bachelor degree Computer Information Systems taught Agile along Scrum Kanban year
Want watch later
Timebox sound like something extraordinary
If reading science fiction novel maybe would another name Fountain Youth
It nothing super extraordinary important valuable rule Agile software development practice
Agile development focus breaking complex requirement smaller task activity completed short length time
This also known iterative software development
While effective many different Agile method concept timeboxing applied type activity
In fact already experienced many time boxed activity life aware formal term
A similar putting time box even possible
A timebox time limit placed around activity task
In Agile practice timebox time limit every activity one main reason Agile practice time quality fixed variable
Scope fixed contrast traditional project management methodology time scope usually fixed
Establishing duration timebox determined prior activity planning developing estimating
Once duration time end activity
Effective timeboxes one limited short duration length time long enough complete activity within reasonable time frame
Once reasonable timebox determined remain consistent
Timeboxing tool applied type activity good first step want incorporate Agile practice
Does term still sound odd
Here example timeboxes probably already participated
This activity requires second time therefore timeboxed second
The doctor nurse place finger wrist start stop watch begin count number beat heart
After second stop counting
Many u taken timed test u like
Timed test hour longer never seems enough time
While deep thought trying solve solution interrupted voice say time
Not fun timebox
A vacation great example timeboxed activity much fun taking timed test
Whether week know long vacation
While may exactly activity planned yet know date leave date return
The duration fixed unless decide spend day Aruba
There many different framework fall Agile methodology timebox least one activity
The following example apply Scrum A Scrum practice Scrum Team name implies circle answer three basic question daily work
The meeting timeboxed minute
Also Scrum framework timebox sometimes referred iteration timeboxed usually two week vary depending team
A sprint time cycle product designed coded tested potentially shipped delivered
Development begin first day Sprint end last day hopefully work completed
If unfinished work future sprint
Get FREE access day create account
A backlog refinement grooming ceremony time product owner present requirement team discus estimate
Not refinement ceremony timeboxed hour time take developer discus requirement usually minute
Now understand timebox couple reason timeboxing good practice
Have ever asked question one day live would
Yes morbid question reality one day live would probably make sure spent time thing value may written form bucket list
You may necessarily get thing bucket list one lifetime probably would prioritize immediately knew one day Earth
The applies timeboxing activity
If know certain amount time work activity set activity spend time valuable one
This ensures important thing done first force prioritization
By keeping timeboxes short reasonable issue exposed earlier process
Consider sprint example end sprint customer chance review developed feature provide feedback
This allows feedback incorporated sooner development process potential issue addressed quickly help reduce risk
great Agile tool applied type activity whether personal life professional one
By applying time activity focus important thing reduce risk

An Augmented Visual Query Mechanism Finding Patterns Time Series Data Eamonn Keogh Harry Hochheiser Ben Computer Science Engineering Department University California Riverside Riverside CA Department Computer Science Interaction Lab Advanced Computer Studies Institute Systems Research University Maryland College Park MD USA Relatively query tool exist data exploration pattern identification time series data set
In previous work introduced
Timeboxes rectangular query studying datasets
We demonstrated Timeboxes used support interactive exploration via dynamic query along overview query result support
In paper extend work introducing Variable Time Timeboxes VTT
VTTs natural generalization Timeboxes permit specification query allow degree uncertainty time axis
We carefully motivate need expressive query demonstrate utility approach several data set
Introduction Timeboxes Interactive Temporal Queries As timeboxes added query graph envelope provides ongoing display effect action overview result set
Once created timeboxes scaled moved singly together modify query constraint
The use simple familiar idiom creation modification timeboxes support interactive use minimal cognitive overhead
Rapid automatic query processing m event provides fast response necessary dynamic query thus supporting interactive data exploration
Users easily quickly try wide range query modify quickly see effect change query parameter
This ability easily explore data helpful identifying specific pattern interest well gaining understanding data set whole
TimeSearcher The corner TimeSearcher window query input space
This space initially contains empty grid
To specify query user simply draw timebox desired location
Query processing begin soon user release mouse signifying completion box
Thus user need press button explicitly start search
When query processing completes display top half application window updated show entity match query constraint
For entity time point correspond query highlighted order simplify interpretation display
An Augmented Query Mechanism One notable feature pattern two peak may close together almost point merging far apart hour
This uncertainly time axis impossible represent Timeboxes
If place two Timeboxes six hour apart mean value reported literature run risk missing positive example peak apart closer together
Two overcome limitation expand definition Timebox allow constraint following form
The time series interest must within specified range specified duration within specified time window
We call constraint Variable Time Timeboxes VTT
We define VTTs concretely follows
A VTT defined two point single integer constraint time series indicating time range dynamic variable must value range least consecutive time unit assuming x x
Figure illustrates difference Timeboxes VTTs
Note Timeboxes considered special case VTTs parameter set zero
As claim VTTs flexible expressive Timeboxes
VTTs placed GUI way Timeboxes
By default value set zero thus act classic Timeboxes
However user left click edge VTT symmetrically resize rectangle representing
Related Work Time series data account increasingly large fraction world supply data
A random sample graphic world newspaper published found graphic time series
Visualizations data attempt improve utility common graph use technique increased data density display emphasize serial periodic nature data set distorting time axis realize denser information display
A recent survey linear temporal visualization found
Generally tool focus visualization navigation relatively little emphasis querying data set
Conclusions The additional expressive power provided VTTs present additional challenge merit study
As VTTs require specification additional parameter creation manipulation likely difficult case simple timeboxes
Identification appropriate mechanism task perhaps including evaluation alternative design needed identify preferred strategy
VTTs also raise question semantics example interpretation overlapping VTTs
The interpretation overlapping timeboxes straightforward overlapping VTTs might confuse user
Other analogous extension timebox model might also possible
For example variable value timeboxes VVTs might support variation value similar valuation time supported VTTs
These query would present challenge creation interpretation efficient processing

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

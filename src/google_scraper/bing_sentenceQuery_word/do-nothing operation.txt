If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution

In pronounced op short instruction statement command nothing
Some computer include instruction whose explicit purpose change state
It often take number execute
In instruction set NOP simulated executing instruction operand cause effect processor instruction recommended solution
A NOP commonly used timing purpose force prevent occupy render void existing instruction jump replaced active instruction later program development replace removed instruction reorganizing would problematic
In case NOP minor side effect example series processor NOP opcode cause synchronization
Listed NOP instruction CPU architecture In case NOP NOPR instruction first second byte mask value condition test equal equal high low etc
If mask branch occurs
In case NOPR instruction second value second byte register branch
If register chosen branch occurs regardless mask value
Thus either two value second byte branch happen
In case NOP instruction second value second byte base register combined base register displacement register offset address
If base register also branch taken regardless value displacement register displacement address
From hardware design point view unmapped area bus often designed return zero since behavior often desirable give bias coding opcode
NOP sometimes used description action performed function sequence programming language statement function code effect might also called
A common
Such code may required grammar programming language allow blank
In statement serf NOP
As syntax forbids control statement function empty statement must used specify action required
Thus programmer forgets write sequence statement program fail compile
The second line example single statement like NOP
In practice generate code statement This statement performs addition discard result
Indeed statement without side effect affect control flow break return removed result computation discarded
The simplest possible statement C behaves like NOP context requiring statement
A compiler required generate NOP instruction case typically instruction whatsoever would generated
Alternatively empty block compound statement may used may legible In case body function block must used empty
In C statement empty simple statement must end semicolon compound statement enclosed brace need following semicolon
Thus context statement grammatically required null statement used
The null statement useless syntactic use wider context within context loop alternatively tersely note last form may confusing generates warning compiler compiler option semicolon usually indicates end function call instruction placed round parenthesis end line
The code continues calling function return newline character essentially current reading location standard input beginning next line
In Fortran statement used context last statement DO loop although used anywhere functionality
As C used used null statement
In fact due specification language BEGIN END block semicolon optional END statement thus semicolon used superfluous
Also block consisting may used placeholder indicate action even placed inside another BEGIN END block
The effect executed thus serf NOP
It primarily used ensure correct syntax due Python example syntax definition requires indented block class logic expressed empty
The library provides function nothing
The framework provides function performs operation
The colon character shell builtin similar effect NOP operation
It technically NOP change special parameter
exit status last command
It may considered synonym shell builtin exit status true
The language statement nothing
The library provides function return undefined nothing
Many include NOP command client issue request response server without requesting action
Such command used server responsive
A NOOP command part following protocol Note unlike protocol listed NOOP command specific purpose allows server send pending notification client
While server respond NOOP command OK programmer added quirky response client
For example daemon responds NOOP message NOPs often involved software check serial number specific hardware software requirement presence absence hardware etc
This accomplished altering bypass security check instead simply return expected value checked
Because instruction security check routine unused would replaced NOPs thus removing software security functionality without attracting attention
The NOP opcode used form allows code execute exact value instruction pointer indeterminate buffer overflow cause function return address stack overwritten

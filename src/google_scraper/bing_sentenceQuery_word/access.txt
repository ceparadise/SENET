The list number open access journal browsing searching
Open access article also often found using general specialized scholarly scientific literature
Many university research institution research funders adopted mandate requiring researcher provide open access research article open access repository
Some publisher publisher association lobbied introducing mandate
The idea mandating mooted least early
Since effort focused open access mandating funders research government research funding agency university
The ROARMAP searchable international database charting growth
As December mandate registered university including Harvard MIT Stanford University College London University Edinburgh research funders worldwide
The often used open access journal shift burden payment reader author funders creates new set concern
One concern publisher make profit accepting paper incentive accept anything submitted rather selecting rejecting article based quality
This could remedied however charging rather acceptance
Another concern institutional budget may need adjusted order provide funding article processing charge required publish many open access journal

It argued may reduce ability publish research result due lack sufficient fund leading research becoming part public record
Unless discount available author country low income external funding provided cover cost article processing charge could exclude author developing country le research field publishing open access journal
However traditional model prohibitive cost access journal subscription already place heavy burden research community green open access eventually make subscription unsustainable cancelled subscription saving pay publishing cost without need divert extra money research
Moreover many open access publisher offer discount publishing fee waiver author developing country suffering financial hardship
access publication provides low cost alternative model
Another concern redirection money major funding agency National Institutes Health direct support research support open access publication
Robert Terry Senior Policy Advisor Wellcome Trust said feel research budget change creation knowledge dissemination knowledge
Research institution could cover cost open access converting model institution annual tool access subscription saving available cover annual open access publication cost
A study annual turnover academic publisher amount approximately EUR billion
It argued money come predominantly publicly funded scientific library purchase subscription license order provide access scientific journal member
The study presented Max Planck Digital Library found subscription budget would sufficient fund open access publication charge
Even advent Internet various model proposed increase access academic research
One early proponent model physicist
To help stem flood publication jokingly suggested beginning career issued voucher pay paper
Closer present still ahead time
This attempt share information good brainchild formerly The Library Corporation
Both Brower Common Knowledge recognised Library Microcomputer Hall Fame

The modern open access movement trace history least back LI placing anything journal public domain
As LI merged form wrote Patrick Straram All material published Situationist International principle usable everyone even without acknowledgement without preoccupation literary property
This facilitate
It became much prominent advent
With spread ability copy distribute electronic data cost argument open access gained new importance
The fixed cost producing article separable minimal marginal cost online distribution
Probably earliest book publisher provide open access publisher arm
They provided free online edition book alongside priced printed edition since assert online edition promote sale print edition

The nonprofit nature JCI allows consideration truly novel solution charge anyone
An explosion interest activity open access journal occurred since largely due widespread availability access
It possible publish scholarly article make instantly accessible anywhere world computer Internet connection
The fixed cost producing article separable minimal marginal cost online distribution
These new possibility emerged time traditional scholarly journal system crisis
The number journal article produced increasing steady rate however average cost per journal rising rate far decade budget academic library remained fairly static
The result decreased access ironically technology made almost unlimited access real possibility first time
Libraries librarian played important part open access movement initially alerting faculty administrator serial crisis
The Association Research Libraries developed SPARC alliance academic research library organization address crisis develop promote alternative open access
The first journal eventually called open access journal began appearing late early
These journal typically used infrastructure volunteer labor developed without intent generate profit
Examples include
The first free scientific online archive started initially preprint service physicist initiated
become norm physic physic physic rate
The prior existence preprint culture physic one major reason arXiv successful
arXiv includes paper related discipline including computer science mathematics nonlinear science quantitative biology quantitative finance statistic

And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Computer Science All President bold new initiative empower American student kindergarten high school learn computer science equipped computational thinking skill need creator digital economy consumer active citizen world
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing computer science CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility

With support new high school course like Exploring Computer Science AP Principles Computer Science designed inclusive accessible student course program designed early elementary school
NSF also funded middle school freshman focused course called Bootstrap curriculum emerged teach computer science computational thinking elementary middle high school
Because CS active applied field Science Technology Engineering Math STEM learning allows student engage interaction key math science engineering principle give student opportunity creator consumer digital economy active citizen world
CS also help foster computational thinking skill relevant many discipline career breaking large problem smaller one recognizing new problem relate problem already solved setting aside detail problem le important identifying refining step needed reach solution
CS also complement President initiative focus growing democratization hardware software tool needed design make anything
As teacher school leader superintendent help expand CS All many different way
For example Spanish computer science teacher creative director Young Women Leadership School Astoria New York integrated digital education coding class including Spanish
Andrea also lead group student known Tech Crew composed filmmaker graphic designer coder website designer project manager
Under Andrea guidance young woman collaborate solve problem around school like teaching student recycling coding educational video game

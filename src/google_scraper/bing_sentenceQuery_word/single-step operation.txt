In single operation defined processor
The size length instruction varies widely little many multiple VLIW system
Most modern processor used instruction size bit
In architecture especially instruction fixed length typically corresponding architecture
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifying operation performed add content memory register zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous operation operand specified single instruction
Instructions rarely specified using form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
There another general definition instruction related processor An instruction may representation element executable

I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

I currently taking class called Logic Computer Scientist
During first four week studying concept Datalog subsection Syntax Formal Semantics Semantics
In week looked several definition atom ground atom herbrand interpretation herbrand model herbrand base concept make complete since
We currently looking something called Single Step Operator Immediate Consequence Operator I hard time understanding actually
It appears form set builder notation simply build set based certain rule
This operator appears take input filter result based rule I looking see somebody actually explain
When come understanding symbol mean I get
But I understand exactly affect data passed
If anybody guidance I would really appreciate good link everything I found Google sort layout I show image offer benefit understanding concept
Thanks advance
It pretty straightforward operational perspective

Typically monotonically growing database
Concretely say following rule fact
Then initial database p
q p q
Then q r p q r
Finally q r
At point would implementation signal stop
In particular formulation I include fact consequence could well
It clear definition treat fact rule empty head

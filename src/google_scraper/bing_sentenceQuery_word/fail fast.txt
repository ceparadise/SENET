discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

It nearly month since I joined IBA BBA favorite choice almost every aspiring business student Pakistan pursuing Bachelors CS Computer Science
For many may seem like second option people failing come merit elite BBA course
Its one time chance get prestigious IBA matter field qualify
But case
The field technology dream ever since good friend mentor mine introduced world tech blogging I started pursue part time career college day
The magic instilled mind ever since
I simply loved I knew I would great field
But one might ask many still I chose IBA university
Well living Karachi belonging family constraint although I ambitious student always managed score pretty well school even secured four year exam
Like aspiring student I also undergo process choosing university higher education
You must journey mind reading
Let share For going Abroad world reputed university like MIT Stanford etc
ruled able score scholarship
So I started looking local university
There really great local opportunity aspiring computer science student like Personally saying GIKI expensive choice
I try SEECS NUST one best failed come merit heart inclined towards LUMS focus also test
Unfortunately even getting successful qualifying LUMS I failed gain financial aid choice also overruled
Ultimately I moved qualified believed BEST institution CS Pakistan
But fate something else mind I left Since ever I go people ask I wish asked instead
Yes FAST best CS university education mean many thing
After seeing campus Karachi I may blunt really want university
This That IBA came
I might thought earlier applying different university I started running option I started looking seriously
Although known business endeavor surprise really good computer science division
Established collaboration IBM Center Computer Studies IBA called Faculty Computer Sciences provides BS MS even PhD degree field
The first batch graduated since kept growing
The thing Computer Science really need best equipment best teacher IBA
You even need good reputation technology university thing IBA one purely getting job
As person working IT journalist I know lot thing field student age normally job seeker IT field like software house Phone manufacturer Telecoms really see university World Ranking good technology program
They need
But need skill set programming whatever IT field Software Engineering Data Structures Computer Systems etc graduated
For worth become expert sitting home get job
There numerous online source like Coursera many learn free week I already gained lot experience basic programming within week source
So go university
The university go make
It groom
It challenge open opportunity
And IBA
Uptil experience pursuing Computer Science IBA good I expected I regret decision I recommend IBA instead FAST anyone looking pursue Computer Science bachelor Karachi
Another thing worth mentioning lot fellow ended going FAST regretfully agree one
If happy student FAST agree choice whatever reason might I assure I mind call biased writer like IBA stuck

submitted I decided take introduction computer science class barely passing first time I believe got around
I took semester I failed I didnt pas combination midterm final I got assignment factor weighed I would finished around
It absolutely devastated
I advance next course I pas first time
I taking increase mark lol
However didnt really work planned
I like studying c I wanted continue I really feel like I failed I idiot I give
If I ca pas second time hell I pas upper year course
What guy think
Thanks everyone Post comment
I thing
Took class got bad grade retook worse grade
I gave moved
I fine upper year
Classes different
They different content taught different prof different time life different age difference resource different support
Different TAs different class time different peer together different experience
One failed class mean fail CS
I excelled many class different one I struggled
I chalked young insecure I never reached anyone help got head judged
Hell I thought I googled something prof would know I use google
Let tell defined CS career
If struggling reach
Here prof TAs peer tutor study group university therapist online forum stack overflow go gym cry call best friend vent reach whatever way
Thanks
I really needed
I need two mark final exam pas course I gon na talk prof
Thanks much
I really appreciate Do look back
Something might gaining
Satchel Paige
I really feel like I failed I idiot I give
You cratered class happens
It happened happen
Do beat grand scheme thing one course matter much
Contrary popular belief undergrad really struggle first CS course
Make sure talk advisor
Some program require minimum score required course minimum score course
Our course GUR elective degree requirement
You long way decide really
If I ca pas second time hell I pas upper year course
Maybe bad teacher phoning got stuck intro class want teach
Maybe acclimated college yet
Maybe figured student yet
Maybe dealing stress issue
exactly probably got amount bullshit class take formally required declare major
Our intro c professor absolute bitch I understand anyone ever passed course
She ended getting entirely different story
Do hard
College really hard
Talk advisor
Talk want I spent good number year staff advisor program
Thanks reply Im gon na go talk I get back school
I class prof semester java emphasis object oriented programming
I bit break get head start
I feel like problem I know give I know
My parent see working really hard subject worried gon na bring basically edge sanity I working hard I want give
I feel like best thing take next class stay drop date I know I
I mean question fail poorly
Was lack interest
Lack studying
Lack ability grasp concept
I suppose concerning thing introductory course
If interest simply give enough time I would worry change study habit time go I guarantee get easier
Sounds lame I feel really test anxiety
We would short amount time quiz thats worth final mark
I would get programming question right I would fumble output code type question cause I enough time
Then quiz worth like mark
I would loose
Its mostly coding I problem I took Discrete math II logic course well Can code
I guess
I say I bit trouble coding I feel like I learned way semester I last
However I think time reevaluate major failing second time uncalled There study regarding group people simply code
Whether valid irrelevant point c professor try weed student intro course
Before continuing changing major write serious project
There resource website teach code good enough job ca get switch might warranted
Well thing I done project I written IOS app following tutorial I done thing written Caesar cipher python I struggle school
I know I bad I well assignment test I choke worth much I ca redeem
I scared though upper year course like said upper year course get harder I wo ready You need try writing respectable project
Making iOS app impressive followed tutorial
Caesar cypher also interesting unfortunately
Do something good amount complexity
If really enjoy math try Project Euler
The problem fit programming without needing much setup
If first problem code
This different developing software course Awesome ill give go right
Thanks
Best luck
Do Google answer feel free Google programming question
If get stuck skip problem move next
Also rough number I pulled bum
But able get done
Spend time think Mister Miyagi
Ill make sure message I Which part problem part get right

Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position
Or I even bother Master CS since I already industry certification
said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right

Dennis said hello I Dennis
I year old I believe I want career computer science
But I never well school I visual kind guy
Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers
tom said Hello everybody
The name Tom I actually getting ready throw CS degree Now majority high school year spent totally ignoring class filling lung MJ booze learning love take care apartment let alone Trust tell I probably worst candidate succeed field thats actually probably true fact
I terrible math I actually process making within month span school start also spending hour day learning code multiple resource online offer structured Java Ruby Python course work progress
I know much current hiring trend related industry internet decides throw know truly believe something waste time business worth totally right
IT WAS FOR YOU A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR factor everyone else like anything perception reality know much business point know successful anything requires want learn see guy seem made decision upon degree primary focus earn learn conclusion study promise fulfilling career without effort people making good money anywhere usually top updated frequently new tool new method new platform new idea better perform job like anything position never promised always someone wanting deliver better product give edge I trying say attitude work ethic set aside degree majority post Im seeing listed regarding CS bad major seem coming never really applied fullest extent otherwise would reason post downer post
The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice
Bluesy said I need help I school c I get
business belt
Mohamed Ali said I year student CS
Most classmate way younger
My advice let anyone tell CS deadened
CS open many door cloud computing robotics web development software engineering research AI game design IoT many
So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer
It bootcamp rather program people good grasp theory maybe lacking programming experience
You take assessment test order qualify program fine last year
Random Awesomeness said discourage people KIDS especially woman want computer please give reason people computer science
Wolfee GameZ said Yea boi game design would good choice knowing code knowing language
Would also help look animation easier opinion
Those two major thing used game
yeye John Doe said Hey everyone Thanks comment really helped
I college student getting basic way
I always loved computer I pretty good user level
I know HTML access command stuff I never formal education tried learn another coding language I never failed math generally making Bs As strongest subject
Should I even bother trying major computer related field
Any advice welcome
Thank
Johny Don said Great article
Thanks response everyone
I know helped anyway
I wondering I could get bit personal advice I college student getting basic way I thinking major computer related field
English History always best subject requiring almost effort I work make As Bs math science
I good computer user level knowing command shortcut bit HTML HOW code even I know language I never formal training
Should I even try
Or I go something suited strength
Which sadly would something involving law politics entertainment I really WANT get

This may get assload trouble I think need said
Following announced Yale business teaching trade skill meaning applied software engineering I going argue
Here rationale I going inevitable Hacker News countertrolling responding advance argument always come I talk way software engineer trained I lucky enough get good advice year ago I entering software engineering business bother college really going help learn code become great building software
Go figure need learn learn
Buy book get training whatever need degree today average CompSci program going serve Jason I got English degree I OK took approximately year get I wanted professionally
It taken month maximum
One biggest professional regret I access right learning resource right time
Undergraduate year would ideal year would worked well
This feeling one thing informed creation CodeLesson
At certain point SE career I thought feeling wanting give back like done CodeLesson I came lot knowledge skill developer hard work also lot guessing asking others reading code
I point I feel like I pick new within week always way
I make clear previous comment knock college undergraduate program
I think certain career college degree process obtain necessary
It I spent year age lot literally hundred book Wrox Microsoft Press O Reilly etc
got busy writing lot code friend sitting computer science class reading theoretical academic book science computing
I recall several time hearing dreading busy work pointless essay due date project little interest figure work helping progress towards building cool stuff
After year u respective path I much ahead term understanding thing help engineer software effectively
One graduated tell difference HTML XML seriously
let alone finer point OOP design pattern
I feel teaching software engineering hand learning writing code architecting application etc essential part process many CompSci program require student actually build much anything pursuit degree serve well come time turn degree going demand build stuff
By way add two cent whole foundation math going high school I excelled math despite hating told throughout high school teacher especially teacher computer class I really going math skill I wanted make programmer
Get first time career I ended really needing understand math month ago I HTML Canvas JavaScript programming
Up I never needed know simple addition subtraction multiplication division
The area knowledge far valuable developer math IMO philosophy logic critical thinking skill communication thorough discussion detail sociology learning manage boss without knowing english yep ENGLISH
able effectively express others thing sometimes easy understand
I agree premise undergrad CS education need evolve
But really undervaluing strong foundation math data structure algorithm
Higher math really nothing pointer arithmetic even sure trying say
But stating system programmer need good basis algorithm mark really undermines point make
Even programmer using implementing thing like framework without understanding algorithm fundamental tend write suboptimal code
You still grind modern computer halt organizing data naively searching using wrong algorithm
Without background algorithm data structure fail even see possible
Frank I saying place algorithm ultimately I imagine undergraduate curriculum could possibly devoid
But I saying teach basic theory alongside applied stuff
Agreed
I hate break academic undeegrad degree getting real job
Your journalism degree get job newpaper
Your law degree get job law firm
Your HR degree get job HR etc
If want study nothing priesthood teach theory sake place grad school job need come becomming professor
I see trend people CS degree becoming like people English degree successful people meet degree professor real use except creating professor
My experience CS major quite different probably depends school
The curriculum provided highly rated CS program I attended structured student could experience world highly applied course taught instructor knowledge first two year theoretical course taught professor latter two
Some course end le useful Formal Model Java VM Computer Architecture example certainly broadened view craft
Since I idea I wanted back I certainly appreciate opportunity introduced entire spectrum instead small subset
Your experience sound ideal
I think lot people missing nuance argument think I want convert CS department Truckmaster School Coding I wrote
You lose aspect CS education adding practical material
I see trend people CS degree becoming like people English degree successful people meet degree professor real use except creating It seem heading way
I go engineering school program considered top world
However computer science program still end highest rate student job graduation highest average starting salary
Based friend classmate I keep touch student feel start work employer definitely look recruit
We mixture class heavy theory practical might help
I feel like school similar school quite highly rated
However top program good CS program
However progress learn theory class contain useful tidbit valuable way spend time trying learn code
I recently took Automata hoping learn regular expression language grammar
Sadly theory hardly corresponds reality topic I supposed writing proof pumping lemma drawing machine I instead learned Bison wrote language
My advice get point A LOT theory learn something useful instead
Silliest idea I ever heard
I got bachelor CS India hint Indian college IIT quality teaching poor
I got Master US even though I web programmer I wish I learned core CS skill better school
Even programmer need know make decision consequence decision web use bad choice configure Apache server thread
process

I even know thing matter need know CS well understand
lack CS knowledge spit code make stupid decision easy code like writing disk making network call loop using inefficient inappropriate algorithm
If approaching programming engineering discipline essential know building block medium work
Find one civil engineer architect required know concrete made taken course mechanic
Or chemical engineer know basic atomic chemistry mechanical engineer learns nothing material metallurgy
If student graduating college US poor engineering skill remediable making software engineering course mandatory
But cost neglecting fundamental
Engineering skill always learned job given right foundation
Jayraj sound like think coding priesthood
I agree
If know thread process making school look poor indeed
None thing mentioned anything teachines jeffrey saying needed
They much applied side
configure Apache server thread
process

I even know thing matter need know CS well understand Computer Science cover anything nearly applied configuring Apache
We need balance US Computer Science department filled mathematician
I definitely agree Jayraj
Probably Brandom suggests problem content US Computer Science department mean CS degree useless practice neccessary reorganize
In Spain bachelor last year time improve practical skill
For example study foundation AI design game use algorithm
On hand I agree programming exclusive CS graduate
Everybody write code computer executes taugh u university supposed apply theorical knowledge real problem
Quoting Jeff Atwood It assumes coding goal
Software developer tend software addict think job write code
But
Their job solve Yet code actually solve problem
A program year two practical instruction sound like would terrific
The thing software engineer necessarily lifetime learner continuing learn year college wrong
My problem post seems advocate University CS program become focused teaching trade skill said shelf life year
That kind thing I expect College program maybe place proper CS program competing DeVry world
I would argue need existing CS program graduating competent student software development trade school graduate
Christopher I never said
The point teach practical alongside theoretical
Python year Theory Computation year
Biology department also teach thing discovered last decade
Just change fast hard mean worth
There much point focusing practical skill year pointed skill would date time graduate joined work force
Honestly though CS program I seen teach practical alongside theoretical
However want skip theoretical altogether get job market quickly practical skill ought shun institution need four year get understanding across
Python example came sense rate adoption accelerating
An undergrad learns today certainly get job year In though chosen Python language teach student
You even chosen Java
If lucky gone Smalltalk good shot
The point take terribly long teach trade skill referring good thing value terribly long either
That kind education Universities focused indeed plenty demand people expertise Universities teaching
Reasonable question though really getting people whose career built around vocational skill short perhaps provide skill enhance existing career
A big part problem pace innovation profession accelerated since professional education kept pace I think missing point Christopher disturbingly seems share name making
Namely university education need something relevant year time today student retiring
When big point criticism university teaching software engineering teacher five ten year date clear asking something good fit university education
If point programmer get education university I could agree
We definitely need trade school side software development need training approach people whose core skill something besides programming cobbling together library
The problem identify kind training wish decide university go turn
I probably dead year time
Anyway say provide education relevant today decade hence
Virtually every technical discipline seems able
I going assumption want teach least SOME practical programming mountain
The practical stuff least current
You give teaching something obsolete year
These computer
It going change quickly CS department need adjust
Plenty university Departments Water called Civil Engineering Environmental Engineering
The core Mark Taylor point civil engineering environmental engineering discipline tend focused rather monolithically point academic department limited charter Department Water one possible example territorialism go away opportunity interdisciplinary research teaching
Yet university Department Stopped reading
It called School Freshwater Sciences Great Lakes Water Institute If fact check basic assertion I trust rest argument based false fact
You might want consider actually looking Mark Taylor book since talking rate example illustrate larger point seem missed I second Frank G comment algorithm data structure theory attached easy yet vital screwing performance code
And first point company wanting hire application programmer true irrelevant company want hire someone fit need exactly need additional training work long hour little money company want invest staff
Really hard
Understanding concept probably hardest part hard
Beyond handful special case sorting algorithm hit worst case thing almost sorted something like
I also think missing fact discussion mostly limited programming make actual code written
We unfortunately great deal choice data structure
By large get hash table
Our array even object often implemented term hash table
Which fine dandy implementing next clone popular website X interested hacking gut next revolutionary system zeromq mongoDB going need better understanding concept much besides
Want work gaming
Better work lin alg
Is impossible folk pick learn thing
Not
University student leg however gone hopefully structured environment
Obviously I never said place skill
But ratio developer game developer huge The point geeat many never even know need know concept real benefit academic base exposed concept obvious necessary I agree concept good programmer need exposed order effective
This especially true come security
inexperienced programmer open program numerous vulnerability security hole know method insecure
It place Universities Universities community teacher scholar
The fact decided make training ground job career fallacy
We already know people multiple career let alone job lifetime
We prepare life straitjacket career
All else stem
The financial mess student loan subsidy school Peter Thiel nonsense various manufactured crisis STEM competitiveness
I attended college year old university year old
Computers around fraction time
Universities work best people study love learn learn learn basic skill like communication analytic thought world
If want people get University grow curious nurturing school environment
They go University go whatever giving u Nobel Prizes PayPal
When people ask important language learn programming computer I tell English
Communication skill software development see light day
Cade The notion university universe knowledge I implying
You learn Pascal Chaucer year I certainly
But Universities sake knowledge sake marketplace
If people want learn software development would take Computer Science major course
Is clear curriculum
IIRC computer science science computation lot discrete mathematics complexity numerical method algorithm
Eventually getting thing like parallelism compiler design etc
Whereas majority software development typically us small amount large amount learning problem domain documenting communicating team analyzing system behavior lot engineering planning programming using call SWEBOK software engineering body knowledge
And know kind programming might interested exposed anyway
I think standard undergraduate degree computer science people already know want programmer software developer looking
So Computer Science department thereof need reformed
If offering compete let compete
You seem implying level playing field within University course come attitude institution
And probably true short term perspective change slow pace
But incentive come le people wanting take Computer Science realize want taking whatever reason
You need give people reason whether better education get Computer Science course showing employer requiring Computer Science degree
You math part
A good software designer need know work need know WHY work
Otherwise keep busy bunch slackjawed deer headlight type stare quietly complexity arrives
If want great programmer take physic bad
I know work even though I used apps I written
Why would I need know work
There people specialize stuff
Why would I need know work
There people specialize I think fairly unprofessional way think I mean disrespect make dependent people understanding expertise
I think practical applied CS really try make sure take managerial approach
Besides pretty awesome algorithm
Let use analogy another field think every psychiatrist necessarily know perform brain surgery
No psychiatrist allowed perform brain surgery
You said used SHA even though know work
Let go one think one must understand quantum entanglement trust stool sitting
I think misleading analogy
That would analogous computer scientist needing know hardware work register level
actually help optimization
At rate I think would appropriate ask psychiatrist least understands core theory mind cognition order better understand mechanism underlay treatment
In way better able tailor treatment specific situation instead applying blunt treatment everything understand better
If understanding security let people specialize stuff put
They already sha library written crypto specialist I sure year CS training top notch school
Then packaged library mortal could use
The majority security problem face people slap together bunch function library
Understanding hashing algorithm weakness purpose essential real security
To understand figure work
What part post stated people learn library work
You possibly implying every programmer must capable cobbling together cryptography library scratch
That plumber must capable mining smelting copper really plumber argument
I saying critical understand theory security algorithm
You hand someone library show use
Without understanding come theory implement significant security hole
Does mean understand use
No
But need understand theory
The plumber analogy really work either
Being plumber mean creating something completely new every time rather maintenance knowing patch broken
To create plumbing system house large building lot going know material physic make sure water get one space another
bunch slackjawed deer headlight type stare quietly complexity arrives ROFLMAO
OP vast majority programmer indeed get without knowing much math algorithm whatever
getting
Doing plumbing
And often plumbing needed
However getting connecting standardised component together limit need people advance state art
We need computer scientist people create component need people understand component work
A case point hashtable
I interviewed hundred people I always ask simple question broad stroke hashtable work
Most people idea even though component everyone know use
But I also struck people using hashtables incorrectly table value
This kind error possible people comprehension hashtable work
This like plumber knowing valve pump work
Damian algorithm versus programming discussion I stated much post I knew people would see get confused
You want bit I say say CS useful valuable
There reason learn Python first semester CS program go implement year
I saying balance way far favor theory basic nobody use practice kill academic CS department teach stuff le year old
Using bullet point magically turn opinion fact
You could tried harder actually looked relevant reference well
Anon opinion
Maybe course English department would make clearer
Anon probably taken many many English course evidenced fact complaining actually creating value
Jeffrey point dead
I recently left failing CS program public university
I year college year I studying CS
I year old almost year since I dropped I successfully running web development business Drupal ZERO thanks ANY education I learned school
Even curriculum practical quality instruction low
Although professor good people busy administrative task prepare lesson answer question outside class really provide ANY help code whatsoever
What ended happening I would partner one student actually know program basically beg help time I could
Those hour time I ever learned anything actually programming
Ironically also kid poorest general education math class really dismal hope ever graduating
It really sad see whole situation
The main point stressed real world software development different discipline CS
If interested pursuing academic level CS research interested math heavy science like physic economics CS degree appropriate
But need plan continue graduate level
In fact reason I stuck second year
I planning pursue graduate level education go research graph theory network analysis
As appealing research career I REALLY wanted Federal government took away need based scholarship I forced drop
I plan returning actually THANKFUL I forced early
The drawback I much time self educate since I working constantly make damned student loan payment every month
It really really frustrating thing getting easier rate continue rise
The failure happening many level entire structure university program going reworked necessity
Technical program face different challenge art everybody facing serious shit right
I want specifically address issue learning fundamental CS
My experience course drawn needlessly assignment essentially meaningless
Sure I learned stack coded one hand I learn stack minute book
No client care I ever coded stack I needed reason I would pull library
But learning vector stack linked list took ENTIRE SEMESTER hundred dollar tuition money
Seriously
Now come research level problem thing nuanced
No generalized curriculum bring student par efficiently
Rather ALWAYS student study ON THEIR OWN learn truly advanced topic
All distracted NONSENSE assignment like coding stack integrating equation hand
Literally every day I school I forced put actual research project work something completely irrelevant interest natural inclination
WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME
I surprised project like CodeLesson replacing CS degree next year
competition bad thing
maybe nothing wrong two school city teach course
infact allowing student share credit different school might cost effective
example situation find difficult follow course X taught professor clash another course schedule work paid job time
let take course university town online course transfer credit graduation
grad school required take two core course system theory application
course based student interest
took software engineering scripting course
complain coursework even though good software engineer would like
said feel merging computer science computer engineering electrical electronic department bad idea smaller university
The notion competition good one unfortunately university make painful transfer credit one campus another
They act like monopolist regard
I started building crystal set grandmother basement
I went experiment germanium diode instead Galena lead crystal
I happy I started building crystal set using galena lead I firm understanding principle scratching crystalline lattice structure order make good electrical contact
I got college year ago west coast public school
To put bluntly I viewed computer major
I biased take wish Computer Engineering Able everything computer scientist software engineer since strong background software hardware complete system development
Computer science If computer engineering hard go might able get job never really understand computer work stop ENGINEERING good software
Or good system thing Software engineer Easy Not much say
Can hardly code know nothing computer architecture word type screen really work
They claim know organize software everyone else
Last get hired first get fired everything two previous major also better
Keep mind nothing people work force experience value degree come school
If someone else job better effectively probably get job
If SE program better hitting book outside class lot understanding programming algorithm data structure nothing software
Knowing processor architecture knowing build computer allow write effective code come intricate solution problem
I worked tech company large small I guarantee first get fired next nothing coder went school major even
Nobody pay attention school year seriously Sounds like CE department good
True CE department teach software poor one
It like poor CS department teach SE
In good school CE CS SE neatly siloed deep also narrow
This true
And Like I said comment apply anyone work force experience applied student graduating degree
I friend major mentioned well one year college I safely say I stated true anecdotally
It still much harder software engineer find job
They harder time solving programming riddle test company like give
Not often take longer get speed company code base since worked much complete system implementation
I also saying degree determines odds getting interview interview I found SE CS student tend lacking department problem solving
At school Computer engineering required take least quarter math class
CS SE student need
Computer engineering take physic chem biology Mechanical statistic class
These considered support class outside required core curriculum
SE CS needed quarter science
So unless SE CS major really wanted step game became sub par level especially since digital embedded system development curriculum
All could high level language computer engineering also required even understand simple thing like stack heap work
It difficult good understanding undercarriage platform
I saying impossible really difficult
I apologize meant reply Jeffrey reply original comment
You extrapolating one crappy program world software developer
The possibly crappy program I familiar required everybody take two physic two chemistry three calculus etc
whether EE CE CS
And seemed plenty demand CS folk
My similar extrapolation despite plenty wonderful example contrary year industry system programmer folk could write code good code professional could read modify
The chief problem software development easy choose problem code solution pat back work
Anybody think genius within week learning program
Why spend four year learning CS I taught program six week Why bother Med School I managed put I gon na get tired repeating I never proposed CS taught
I interested reforming tech education destroying
I hate mean explained clearly original post spend much time comment thread correcting folk misimpressions
I went back looked original post really mess
And hot mess
Sorry expressed character
That I blog
The real problem people bring baggage discussion result project want see particularly read comment Reddit first click actually read post
The tipoff point I repeatedly state post academic CS system programming valuable necessary people respond asking I understand value academic CS system programming
I sure I could state clearly
If something particular unclear let know I happy clarify
But clear lot people skimming piece projecting bias getting wrong
I agree need reform point trying make comparing level education associated different major college
CS become lazy
My mother Undergrad master CS would tell story kind work class always seemed difficult
program seem teach problem solving repetition focus knowing language understanding certain method employed trying resolve issue
It become case way And I think make clear original post I giving view since I school long ago
Please keep mind US
I live Switzerland education system different guess country also different system
After year elementary school mandatory go two way either go high school track choose like math language think apply apprenticeship take year usually work day go school day also upper vocational school time
You need final exam
So went high school go university study CS
But made apprenticeship upper vocational school go advanced technical college study applied science take year get bachelor applied science
You advanced technical college already work experience field like study
Furthermore university hand solution exercise every week hand allowed take exam
For example Algorithm Datastructure course every week problem recently discussed solve
In master course take course heavily based programming project
One Algorithm Laboratory solve problem efficient solution correct datastructure algorithm
This verified server run application check correctness runtime
I see university change shut CS department
You definitely program done bachelor CS Without ability shut reorganize academic department little motivation improve curriculum particularly world tenured prof prioritize research teaching
This many American CS program teach Java Yale dismisses important social technical innovation generation trade skill I agree fully observation
I undergraduate study well ranked engineering school India quality department really reflect well ranking
There course I took four year influenced skill developer today I strongly attribute involvement open source project time I spent online reading work
I fall within category good software engineering practice area truly lacking
I try best follow good testing practice really I want degree confidence system I write last thing I want publish buggy result I spend lot time trying learn design large system making sure system well testable also trying ensure sure code unit system integration test
I asked colleague unit test never heard
I believe reason behind widening gap CS programme reality good majority professor academia life end deciding curriculum
The TAs hire teach programming fresh undegraduate programme really pro either
Lalith even I went school
School highly ranked NIT status
Computer Engineering department absolutely piece crap two airhead professor treat department like household
However story different IITs perhaps NITs
Self made system analyst
When come computer science imho either
I zero college experience working field since I young teen
I tried take computer science college found waste money well actual expertise
However computer engineering completely different story take completely different background become one
I also learned employer expect know decent bit one programming language spend time focusing one language another find struggling adapt first job
I think discussion focused much undergraduate part
Computer Science program country mostly known graduate program whose intended output handful software engineer system developer
UF Gainsville always known stellar CS grad program
To shut criminal
If really stellar stay open
I propose shut program I proposed reorg shut
UF Gainsville nobody world stellar CS school grad undergrad
The grad program ranked nation
I think stellar I think merit continued existence
What
How many slot available student interested learning CS
If elite enough go MIT CMU go home get job plumber
qualify stellar
It good school stellar
That point
Everyone want learn able
The excuse mediocre program institutional inertia
Re make sense UCLA Cal State LA single combined computer science program among best country instead two mediocre computer science program Typically university better clustered around hub
Competition student teacher rating sponsor good quality
Facilities lower barrier university hub
It reason car industry centered around Detroit
You compete hub
I agree point I think missing boat many people go college learn trade goal college treat trade
That ECPI
The goal college teach learn expose breadth idea approach extraordinarily difficult obtain
I sure many people could write Rabbin Fingerprinting algorithm function calculate Levenshtein distance two string implement QuadTree top head
But graduate would exposed structure would know various applicable scenario leverage
Could create spatial search without QuadTree
probably nearly efficient
Could create good Captcha without understanding entropy
Probably robust
It pretty easy day Microsoft stack developer without understanding bridge managed unmanaged code mean still memory leak modern system lead application wonderfully intuitive functional user experience test bench crumbles weight opened public
The could said applied
On job perfectly valid sometimes preferential
Somebody grown Power Electronics family symbiotic relationship transformer would probably make great engineer experience take far fully grasp underlying principle
One problem perceived value actual value
As professional developer college grad without comp sci degree I interview want know I graduated college I comp sci degree
I professional software development successfully year comp sci degree
I turned many many job lack comp sci degree overlook missed lack skill compiler building OS memory management
Furthermore stuff I learned getting college degree also irrelevant every job I ever
These problem
Prospective employee need college degree perceived relevant
Prospective programmer need comp sci degree perceived relevant
If want job someone else employee get change perception
You take chin play along
Jeffrey McManus know first thing writing code
Without scientific mathematical foundation computer science provides one hope write useful code
I suggest actually attempt write complex algorithm instead writing poorly argued blog post really company CodeLesson
You post particularly point end
It say think say
make sense UCLA Cal State LA single combined computer science program among best country I think problem better chance create one large mediocre computer science program
must also accept notion plumber must ability smelt copper forge pipe Not really
Do often say plumber I want new bath like bath ever seen new unique feature X Y Z
I know work even though I used apps I written
Why would I need know work
That part problem You know know
This maybe best example never know future may bring thing prepare teaching conceptual underpinnings rather specific current technology
For instance would though year ago would real possibility writing game front end web developer
I like distinction made computer science applied computer engineering
It make lot sense past year since graduating I struggled adapted finally found balance two allows career developer
I think eliminating CS department around country good idea
I think applicable approach would split CS two group defined make one aspect cirrculum applied engineering business communication class
I fumbled year developer fresh college
I excited anxious put education test actually code thing useful
The largest obstacle I maintaining professionalism communicating business partner developer healthy goal oriented way
Elimination program mistake
Augmenting people skill making distinction science engineering would help future developer succeed quickly speed modern business
The problem without eliminating department challenging enact reform I found CS component SE degree useful practise
However perhaps I SE CS course I important one
While I feel university lacking quality SE course I think SE CS university could seriously benefit teaching skill
Especially skill diverge CS SE
Business general problem solving math economics law
I think important supplement good SE degree
Only yesterday I drew upon skill I learned CS course elective SE degree solve business problem
I doubt I would solve problem quickly well I learnt skill
My employer know difference SE CS
Make
I
It true truly dismal CS program
But also good one achieve good mix theory practice
I happen teach one year industry everything digital electronics embedded system AI scheduling system
Over year I worked programmer I would call software engineer lacked good grasp basic data structure algorithm concurrency mention basic process element like revision control regression testing
It extremely limiting lead serious problem
A year ago I called troubleshoot situation group built database app client without understanding transaction
They cost employer boatload money nearly got company sued existence
While true everyone development team need understand graph theory really need least core understand pretty intuitive level basic complexity concurrency pretty much project
I mixed feeling
I fortunate enter field could still make fortune garage
Not going college intended career software development much
People insist sheepskin
That said back day studied anything computer related connected math department involved learning keypunch
Zero practical knowledge
You god understood computer
I think situation improved typical computer science department using year old textbook computer system whatever practical knowledge got obsolete going much le coming
But nearly much think
I run circle around college graduate
One memorable situation I hired help kid BS University Arizona getting project release
I shocked find even run compiler week
He obsessed everything perfect theoretically pristine could even bring compile test code much le release
As soon I conveyed info business study master degree Texas probably professional student day I production within couple week
That company went one company business plan income stream owner ultimately sold million buck happy
This illustrates contrast trying draw
Software development much craft science perhaps MORE craft science
College large teach craftsmanship pride workmanship appreciation elegance
If cultivate thing smell bad practice idea even intimate acquaintance internals component tool working
The notion learning theory efficient path practical competence mostly misguided unless intend work
My advice young coder get degree get program emphasis partnership business internship open source participation like
One able hit ground running graduate
If wasting boatload money
I finance guy much idea talking I interested I young kid first enter high school I work part society
I struggle giving guidance best prepare kid innovation world entering post comment least help formulate better question ask kid school hope attend day
Nice work
Thanks Mark
My daughter I thinking way
One approach taking accept limit school menu term breadth depth curriculum enrolled online math learning site called ALEKS prepare middle school math kicking butt
I wish student would open instead limited whatever school schedule class
I expect fair bit outcry however Jeffrey McManus great article make great point seem soften blow
Share TwitterFacebookLike I little enraged reading title post surprisingly I agree observation reading post
I final year c undergrad
In final year seems good idea take undergraduate study c
I think point confusion among student professor since think student learn theoretical computer science think learn software engineering include part faculty well student
Its clear anyone think expects
The fact remains huge demand software professional industry people keep going c study find becoming software professional end
The distinction made In view CS department merged Mathematics department Engineering study different Software Engineering student take necessary course CS curriculum
Great viewpoint thanks posting
I think coding course kind mandatory undergrad
Jeff I think missed point completely
CS graduate advanced degree go work firm like Google Microsoft IBM Intel produce tool software I use productivity every day
One get CS degree become coder
I started coder COBOL year ago
Today I SQL Server developer
I BA History MBA nothing job
However I unique understanding database technology appreciation computer scientist developed technology
You win award person skim post decide I away CS completely
Wrong
another point one positioning
The term programmer coder somewhat derogatory suggestive someone noncreative rote assembly work
Perhaps departmental casual programmer fit description extent time
Personally I prefer refer software developer right balance conveys I professional go complex process I something generalist also implies consulting aspect thing
One must understand business businesspeople one going effective job software development
The biggest failing field IMO failure make sure software serf business need represent technological masturbation
I understand making point one get CS degree become coder software developer whatever choose call exactly point Jeffrey made blog post
What saying young people understand late
Too many pursue CS degree discover like young fella I spoke afraid compiler actually develop software
That problem
I wonder many people get CS degree founder around year teach craft degree becomes nothing checklist item get past HR gatekeeper entry level job
Also Jeffrey also pointed sort validating year one care degree skill actually demonstrated workplace kind reputation built
Agree point reforming computer science program
But make happen
What missing actual action consumer education take result better computer science program turn graduate theoretical practical skill
That probably different post consumer education steer toward school practical instead theoretical focus assuming making software instead delving theory goal take extra project expand knowledge pursue course necessarily available campus area specialization
Online learning lot offer although I doubt college student dissatisfied getting campus think turn elsewhere round knowledge
This true college student well professional way
If accept argument must also accept notion plumber must ability smelt copper forge pipe could possibly lay pipe effectively without ever created one bare hand elemental material
So argument hey doctor need basic chemistry make drug
Well truth
They need know biology chemistry Latin many thing
Just like software engineer need know memory pointer XOR
Truth stuff trivial
It rocket science
People comprehend trivial thing business software development
As far CS department adapting modern time got wrong
Bad CS program teach program Java C
Good CS program teach people understand fundamental since picking new language trivial thing anyone know computer work
So I need capable building cryptography library order use cryptography library
No sorry software development work planet
I think crypto especially good understanding fundamental ought stay away
I mean I running app SSL well good I decided kind pick choose different piece library make crypto protocol app Gee I thought I change way random number generator work little bit fantastically bad idea led end suffering Internet
If understand crypto yeah
Perhaps pick different example
If really understand build graphic library I problem writing GUI app
As student bioinformatics program I trouble giving much importance balance program content
I feel like good knowledge data structure algorithm combined strong understanding commonly used programming language like Java python enough get started
Since CS engineering program seem provide basic choice focusing concrete fundamental stuff personal
A smart CS major worth smart software engineer I think maybe short adaptation period produce quality software
It particular mentality flooding market bad programmer people perceive programmer
A programmer need learn basic programming reliable source university trial error posting question stackoverflow
I worked many outstanding programmer spent time university
I know even attended university technical major
That almost proof university huge role play space except perhaps graduate program elective undergraduate level
A took class software engineering class required large amount programming
The rest learned job internship
A lot engineer automotive industry degree Mechanical Engineering Materials Engineering
The number specialized Automotive Engineering program undergraduate level small
I think
Industry simply move fast academia lot programming issue method I think academia smart concentrate core competency
Just university something today mean never
School prison military
I think issue come role university
Professors generally hold university exist facilitate scholarship student attend university premise benefit get taste
However get government money either directly via aid student university allowed people believe college education ticket higher earnings
The promotion scholarship disregard skill development typical academic life
The business school refuse teach salesmanship psychology department refuse teach get way using psychology someone professor social study interested teaching become popular
social
totally agree although lot professor love teaching great
fact priority skewed far favor research desire incentive
publication much easier measure successful teaching
interestingly dynamic messed internet open new opportunity publishing traditional journal demonstrate number serious shortcoming
I read comment said already following one idiotic thing I ever read Internet
It necessary two university located within commuting distance academic Have ever Cambridge MA
Whose chemistry department think shut Harvard MIT
I read comment idiotic actually
Did read
You must missed part address program top tier
You good point I agree commenters knowledge math essential
Pointer arithmetic good example various branch applied math used programming
The math involved doubt dependent particular programmer application
Some programmer might encounter sporadically others like use almost daily basis
My POV better understanding algorithm data structure graph theory limitation floating point arithmetic etc etc powerful application build
As smelting yes possible take enough extreme becomes infeasible
You find balance
I say software industry almost year worked hired many many software developer opinion make damn bit difference formal training one
A engineer either good bad
I think innate skill taught
Sure taught new language matter taught innate ability NEVER good programmer
Good programmer experience taught know
Some best I ever worked even degree educated
And biggest bugbear graduate architect
Kids coming program hired architect
What joke
These kid never written real line code life make pretty much impossible good architect course may oxymoron anyway beside point

I learned thing computer science program coming fruition word degree program prepared next twenty year evolution computer programming architecture
But I went really really good computer science program
I really fan ageism article
University undergraduate discriminating consumer education Really
Come
Some know like people every group
The ageism since I never said year old discriminating consumer
But want discus assertion merit make point

The Computer programming boost Technical word new era going began computer
The funny thing job require much education truth software developer monkey comparison minority
I internship developer working big name commercial website think Toys R Us Toshiba etc NYC monotonous thing ever
I felt like I hamster running wheel learning thousand way thing
I since started graduate school research assistanceship honestly depends looking career
Most research actually extremely relevant grad PhD level example school ranked top head I know research project CUDA advanced graphic processing algorithm tracking disease spreading via context crawler data posted something I hopefully contributing soon using new algorithm biometrics security mobile application
Honestly anyone see practical side education simply touch using hemisphere brain perfectly okay job ground breaking sense new thats okay still innovation idea affect life
Think though without academic could apply application Ada Lovelace special obsessive abstract idea
If handle monotonous job flunking freshman physic may symptom
Great article indeed
This article many valid point
Will give idea current CS student
All course student required take pretty much based attribute math engineering fluff soft skill anyone learn understand
Most university provide hard decent math course provide hard good engineering course
Courses like data base design software engineering pattern operating system concept etc
typically suck
One reason school able find hire top notch engineer also good teacher
They expensive make good living without teaching
That different prestige school increase
So put math fluff course
And excel many CS student basically need become good mathematician
As result university printing frustrated mathematician frustrated people like math
There one real question though
Are alternative
How poor university get good engineer teach
And many good engineer good teaching
They rare breed
I think black white solution problem thing could change Open courseware course online huge potential providing good engineering course worldwide
They big thing future
Employers need specific skill create efficient training program teach skill hard teach outside work setting working large code base testing controlling large project
Employers work university remove fluff make engineering stuff better add course correspond real life scenario
But hell break loose put employer one room academic probably work
I see graduate applying job showing cv experience
Two first neither knew substring function I BSc Information Systems back teach program degree
I would say degree computer science generally completely unnecessary take year training internet proficient long work hard year
This article resembles exact thought current standing CS degree
I sure hope department realize teaching subject practically disconnected industry requiring moment future
I think missed one key factor quality educator WANT educate
It opinion collegiate educator actually good provide incredible value student interested educational side institution
They interested money research
Secondly aspect sitting class room actually coding I think even worst CS program applied sw engr MIS Analytics percentage wise far le amount time spent classroom far spent classwork
Some class work may applicable real world I seen several program highly theoretical highly practical much higher percentage actual work percentage class time
Any many program even care actually come class long show work
Testing area I think could dropped program technical
Make student
Thirdly You probably never get situation school willing either condense program geographically dense educational area reason school sprout program desire money
I started university engineering school state school system
The central main campus state lost accreditation one engineering program time decided wanted start new engineering major program still unaccredited highly ranked engineering program major campus I went
Why
central campus wanted keep fund would go program central campus instead sending another campus
Lastly I seen far new hire mid tier level various role management hiring self educated thing poorly understand done poorly I seen equivalent college graduate
From perspective far self learned engineer going build production system look like pieced together coding sample holistic architecturally solid solution year
At time I pleasure working plenty others thought problem properly created well designed solution understood
In opinion often individual NOT program lack thereof make break approach
Saying bother college universally appropriate approach opinion
That work others
Just like distance learning work others
I also seen great candidate come bad program I seen bad candidate come great program
A program individual make end
Thanks article fantastic read
I currently working going back school part time computer science JC
I frustrated languid pace class inability match work schedule school schedule
This piece helped let go idea I need degree change career I hard time idea
One major issue I independent study structure
Where progress
Any advice
science mean applied software engineering argued Jeffrey McManus blog post
In Fortune web article Jeff John Roberts counter Computer Science degree may

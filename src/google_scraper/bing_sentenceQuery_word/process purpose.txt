In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

In computing computer system
Virtual machine based provide functionality physical computer
Their implementation may involve specialized hardware software combination
There different kind virtual machine different function Some virtual machine designed also emulate different architecture allow execution software application operating system written another architecture
allows resource computer partitioned via support multiple isolated instance usually called may look feel like real machine
A VM originally defined efficient isolated duplicate real computer machine
Current use includes virtual machine direct correspondence real hardware
The desire run multiple operating system initial motive virtual machine allow among several operating system
In respect system virtual machine considered generalization concept historically preceded
IBM first system allow implemented providing user operating system CMS
Unlike virtual memory system virtual machine entitled user write privileged instruction code
This approach certain advantage adding device allowed standard system
As technology evolves virtual memory purpose virtualization new system may applied manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machine one computer operating system
It may possible share identical content among multiple virtual machine run physical machine may result mapping physical page technique termed
This especially useful page holding code segment case multiple virtual machine running similar software software library web server middleware component etc
The guest operating system need compliant host hardware thus making possible run different operating system computer prior version operating system support future software
The use virtual machine support separate guest operating system popular regard
A typical use would run simultaneously preferred complex operating system Linux Windows
Another use would novel unproven software still developmental stage run inside
Virtual machine advantage operating system development may include improved debugging access faster reboots
Multiple VMs running guest operating system frequently engaged server consolidation
A process VM sometimes called MRE run normal application inside host OS support single process
It created process started destroyed exit
Its purpose provide programming environment abstract away detail underlying hardware operating system allows program execute way platform
A process VM provides abstraction compared ISA abstraction system VM
Process VMs implemented using performance comparable compiled programming language achieved use
This type VM become popular implemented using
Other example include run VM called
All serve computer language
A special case process VMs system abstract communication mechanism potentially heterogeneous
Such VM consist single process one process per physical machine cluster
They designed ease task programming concurrent application letting programmer focus algorithm rather communication mechanism provided interconnect OS
They hide fact communication take place attempt present cluster single machine
Unlike process VMs system provide specific programming language embedded existing language typically system provides binding several language
Examples PVM MPI
They strictly virtual machine application running top still access OS service therefore confined system model
Both system virtual machine process virtual machine date continue area active development
grew notably implemented CTSS
allowed multiple user use computer program appeared full access machine one program executed time system switching program time slice saving restoring state time
This evolved virtual machine notably via IBM research system used used early example
The first widely available virtual machine architecture see detail
An important distinction using multiple virtual machine one host system using one virtual machine host system prototyping SIMMON
hardware emulation earlier system compatibility date back software emulation simulation predates
arose originally abstract platform used program early example date around
An early example virtual machine executes object code emitted compiler
This abstraction allowed compiler easily ported new architecture implementing new took existing compiled machine code underlying physical machine
The language used similar design intermediate language named portable
This popularized around notably system compiler termed resulting machine
This influential virtual machine sense often generally called machine
In addition intermediate language Pascal also executed directly interpreter implementing virtual machine notably influenced later interpreter notably JVM
Another early example written SNOBOL Implementation Language SIL assembly language virtual machine targeted physical machine transpiling native assembler via
Macros since fallen favor however approach le influential
Process virtual machine popular approach implementing early microcomputer software including adventure game implementation engine like argues possibly portable virtual machine ever created
Significant advance occurred implementation particularly implementation pushed forward implementation approach us process virtual machine
Later notable Smalltalk VMs
A related language produced lot virtual machine innovation programming language pioneered
These technique proved commercially successful Java virtual machine
Other innovation include virtual machine better match underlying hardware rather virtual machine closer match programming language pioneered language
In full virtualization virtual machine simulates enough hardware allow unmodified guest OS one designed run isolation
This approach pioneered IBM predecessor family
Examples outside mainframe field include discontinued formerly called GSX Server vBlade technology
In virtualization hardware provides architectural support facilitates building virtual machine monitor allows guest OSes run isolation
virtualization first introduced IBM use first virtual machine operating system
In provided additional hardware support virtualization
Sun Microsystems added similar feature processor
Examples virtualization platform adapted hardware include
In hardware support found rarely offer performance advantage software virtualization
In virtualization physical server virtualized operating system level enabling multiple isolated secure virtualized server run single physical server
The guest operating system environment share running instance operating system host system
Thus also used implement guest environment application running given guest environment view system
The pioneer implementation example include AIX Parallels Virtuozzo Containers

The SCS Labs giving user ability run virtual operating system Virtual Machines
There number VMs specifically built particular course
There number benefit use VM including The Virtual Machines format unless otherwise noted
They usually opened virtualization product
The naming convention course code course built followed optional term designation represents term originally created
Many VMs continue used future term different course
Most Virtual Machines use VirtualBox Extension Pack please make sure add install VirtualBox see guide
We include checksum verify integrity downloaded file
Here check checksum different operating system The tested Windows Mac OSX Linux
There known issue Windows pre version VirtualBox
download file properly

This guide deal primarily issue related
Other hypervisors may used run Virtual Machines provide technical support
The computer running VirtualBox
A Virtual Machine running imported VirtualBox
Here common issue check cause VirtualBox Virtual Machine fail entirely poor performance It important update VirtualBox
Older version VirtualBox noted tested newer Virtual Machines
Older Virtual Machines work fine newer version VirtualBox
To import one SCS Virtual Machines VirtualBox already installed using step follow step To Virtual Machine guest simply click desired one click button
Some larger Virtual Machines take boot linux operating system show login screen
It lot slower performance logged Virtual Machine Desktop Shell poor consult section
How use Virtual Machine depend course consult TAs
Some useful thing know When done using Virtual Machine
This done three way If shutdown guest operating system way pressing button pulling power cord desktop computer
This result hard drive error depending
Some VMs take much minute shut depending system please patient
Once VirtualBox installed installed Virtual Machines work configuration
However common error may still experienced The common cause Virtual Machine working poor performance Extension Pack missing
Make sure installed In case VirtualBox setup Network correctly installation
A network required Virtual Machines permit network connection Virtual Machine common requirement web development database application development course
To see Virtual Machine requires network connection check
One adapter say
There also normally one say connection provides network access browse web etc
This error may come many different form exact wording may vary
This error usually occur opening Virtual Machine
However virtualization enabled also adversely impact performance Virtual Machines
If Virtualization enabled enable computer BIOS
You may need computer model find enter BIOS
look setting called includes name
Make sure set
Once complete reboot system
You able open Virtual Machines

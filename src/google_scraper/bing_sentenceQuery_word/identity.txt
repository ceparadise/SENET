A short time ago I meeting Computer Science faculty sat around voicing opinion important field student learn
The discussion centered around trying define CS question field going
I feeling deja vu basic opinion voiced many time recent year
As I sat listening suddenly occurred underlying psychological problem taken Computer Science field malaise experiencing identity crisis questioning value
Let explain
During discussion one Computer Scientists mentioned talk CS becoming next would finally put CS equal footing field like Physics Chemistry Biology Earth Sciences
What happened asked went lament science usually view CS merely supporting work
Another Computer Scientist suggested CS made mistake thinking field creation software software system
He argued computer programming heart instead suggested CS relabel field focus computational thinking one provides solution computational problem
Each position symptomatic underlying problem instead proud great accomplishment creation Internet powerful interactive computer system changed way people around world work play computer scientist seem stuck doldrums feeling disappointed wishing academic prestige
A suggestion

Almost every worldwide government agency responsible identity theft issue tell thing The first step fighting identity theft minimize risk
Identity theft crime whereby criminal impersonate individual usually financial gain
In today society often need reveal personal bit information social security number signature name address phone number cell number even banking credit card information
If thief able access personal information use commit fraud name
Armed personal information malicious person could number thing like apply loan new credit card account
It possible could request billing address change run existing credit card without knowledge
A thief could use counterfeit check debit card authorize electronic transfer name wipe fund bank account
Identity theft also go beyond monetary impact
Thieves use information obtain driver license documentation would display photo name information
With document thief could obtain job file fraudulent income tax return apply travel document file insurance claim even provide name mailing address police authority involved criminal activity
The outcome identity theft usually regardless thief obtains information
However providing new way people steal personal information commit fraud
Thieves accomplish goal several way using Internet spreading drop key logger computer transmit password usernames credit card number use computer back thief
Many business today also store personal information customer shopper provides another way personal information accessed without permission knowledge
Additionally another way thief attempt gather personal information
Phishing email falsely claim established legitimate enterprise attempt scam surrendering private information used identity theft
The direct visit website asked update personal information credit card social security bank account number information legitimate organization already
The website however bogus set steal information
identity theft problem make people hesitant making purchase online signing others consider everyday occurrence creating account purchasing site using auction site even using Internet banking checking credit card statement online
While identity theft definitely hot topic medium today Internet identity theft actually account small percentage total identity theft fraud case
A survey Javelin Strategy Research Pleasanton indicated identity fraud percentage United States adult population went percent
In addition report also claim percent identity theft take place traditional offline channel Internet
Computer forensics application scientifically proven method gather process interpret use digital evidence provide conclusive description cyber crime activity
Cyber forensics also includes act making digital data suitable inclusion criminal investigation
Once thief obtained data computer often used create false identification counterfeit check document commit fraud
Computer forensics play big role helping law enforcement official identify victim perpetrator identity theft
The one many organization provides valuable fact information consumer concerning identity theft including preventative resolution identity theft concern
For consumer believe victim identity theft FTC recommends take immediate step protect placing fraud alert credit card filing police report filing complaint Federal Trade Commission
It also important resolve specific fraudulent usage organization responsible bank account credit card driver license investment fund debt collector others
Almost every worldwide government agency responsible identity theft issue tell thing
To urge consumer protect personal information
Start asking company use information online transaction take moment review website privacy policy
For Internet transaction sure Web site offer secure data service protect personal information
In offline transaction provide credit card number financial account number personal identifying information phone unless know communication line secure
Ideally initiate phone conversation
Lastly recommended everyday practice keeping eye postal mail ensure bill arriving taking time properly dispose paper document may contain credit card number identifying personal information

UK US property certain applied multiple time without changing result beyond initial application
The concept idempotence arises number place particular theory connected property
The term introduced context element algebra remain invariant raised positive integer power literally mean quality power power
There several meaning idempotence depending concept applied A map set called idempotent In particular defined idempotent element defined
An important class idempotent function given
An example projection function defined project arbitrary point space point third coordinate equal
A unary operation idempotent map element
We partition set element chosen fixed point point number different idempotent function
Hence taking account possible partition total number possible idempotent function set
The number idempotent function given sum start
sequence Neither property idempotent preserved composition unary function
As example former max idempotent although happens
As example latter negation function idempotent
Given set element said idempotent respect In particular exists idempotent respect operation true
The binary operation called idempotent every element idempotent
That denotes set membership For example operation idempotent general operation
The connection three notion follows
As mentioned identity map constant map always idempotent map
The function argument real argument idempotent
The function assigns every subset idempotent
It example closure operator idempotent function
The operation subtracting mean list number every number list idempotent
For example consider number
The mean
Subtracting every number list yield
The mean list
Subtracting every number list yield list
The operator used express repetition idempotent
An idempotent element definition element idempotent ring multiplication
That element idempotent precisely
Idempotent element ring yield play role describing homological property ring
While idempotent usually refers multiplication operation ring ring operation idempotent example
In operation idempotent
This implies every element Boolean algebra idempotent respect operation
Specifically
In idempotent
In fact projection vector space exactly idempotent element ring vector space
After fixing shown matrix projection respect basis idempotent matrix
An also sometimes called semiring whose multiplication idempotent
If operation semiring idempotent semiring called
In term used comprehensively describe operation produce result executed multiple time
This may different meaning depending context applied
In case call instance mean modified state remains first call
In though idempotent function one property value
This useful property many situation mean operation repeated retried often necessary without causing unintended effect
With operation algorithm may keep track whether operation already performed
A function looking customer name address typically idempotent since cause database change
Similarly changing customer address typically idempotent final address matter many time submitted
However placing order car customer typically idempotent since running call several time lead several order placed
Canceling order idempotent order remains canceled matter many request made
A composition idempotent method subroutine however necessarily idempotent later method sequence change value earlier method depends idempotence closed composition
For example suppose initial value variable sequence read variable change read
Each step sequence idempotent step reading variable side effect changing variable always effect matter many time executed
Nonetheless executing entire sequence produce output executing second time produce output sequence idempotent
In HTTP idempotence major attribute separate
Of major HTTP verb GET PUT DELETE implemented idempotent manner according standard POST need
GET retrieves resource PUT store content resource DELETE eliminates resource
As example reading data usually side effect idempotent fact
Storing deleting given set content usually idempotent long request specifies location identifier uniquely identifies resource resource future
The PUT DELETE operation unique identifier reduce simple case assignment immutable variable either value respectively idempotent reason end result always result initial execution even response differs
Violation unique identification requirement storage deletion typically cause violation idempotence
For example storing deleting given set content without specifying unique identifier POST request need idempotent often contain unique identifier creation identifier delegated receiving system creates corresponding new record
Similarly PUT DELETE request nonspecific criterion may result different outcome depending state system example request delete recent record
In case subsequent execution modify state system idempotent
In idempotence refers ability system produce outcome even event message received
In instruction might possibly cause idempotent
So page fault occurs OS load page disk simply faulted instruction
In processor instruction idempotent dealing page fault much complex
When reformatting output expected idempotent
In word output already pretty nothing
Applied example many people could encounter life include call button crosswalk button
The initial activation button move system requesting state request satisfied
Subsequent activation button initial activation request satisfied effect

You demonstrate portion personal identity outwardly wear interact people
You may also keep element personal identity even part important
Have ever struggled question I
thought might become future
These question thought discussed throughout history particular philosopher immersed search knowledge nature human
Such question mean person

engaged key thinker created conversation still grapple society
Most people feel want endure way life beyond death
The philosophy personal identity aim address matter existence even know exist time
How know person child
Is remember growing within body
Or perceive mind
What criterion used confirm fact
When ask know person baby question persistence
In context mean existence across time prove
In word perceive self life human know sure
The philosopher Plato René Descartes well many religion proposed persist soul timeless essence continues form even death living breathing human body
Descartes particular aimed provide argument enduring inner self
He used rational argument example demonstrate mind body distinct
He promoted view mind exist persist without body
This distinction person mind body known dualism influential powerful theory society
Here illustration mind body dualism Descartes Even today may often hear phrase soul
This way thinking evolved idea religious tradition well philosophical way viewing personal identity

For instance person identifies part particular political party particular faith see class might discover different person
Perhaps longer interested politics changed religion living le money
Any variation possible person life span
Children developing sense self may experiment different way expressing personal identity
This include various way dressing wearing hair also include variety way behaving thinking
They might find way expressing work well feel right others last
Throughout life sense continually change
According philosopher David Hume living life human leaf impression rather one stable identity sense self
These changing shifting element existence
Think various way looked world throughout life
You set experience changed
Hume argued due unstable nature impression personal identity said persist time
We perceive sense self way mind put impression together make sense
For instance take vacation every year different location would hard say really based different experience
Does mean sand warmth invigorating hike mountain
Is relaxation adventure
Unless experience year year vacation vary
Vacation one unchanging idea Hume perspective neither person
Hume challenged earlier idea persistence psychological physical continuity theory come
looked human body life help u know
focused mind memory seem tie person identity together
Hume questioned theory talked enduring personal identity
Instead pointed fleeting nature experience
Philosophers grappling topic explored concept many angle asking question know
Many concept left legacy way thinking culture Descartes duality
Some concept might sound new Hume argument prove personal identity self

Oct Odysseas Papadimitriou Identity theft occurs someone gain unauthorized access personally identifying information name Social Security Number SSN bank account information us commit fraud crime
The crime identity thief able commit personal information range applying credit card name subsequently racking prodigious charge poaching tax In case identity thief even able assume unsuspecting identity entirely obtaining identification bearing name often committing crime Those terrifying prospect say clear identity theft cost lot money well create confusion across breadth life despite horror story wonder prevalent identity theft actually well prevent
answer question
The Federal Trade Commission estimate many million Americans experience form identity theft However number subject fluctuation crime fighting tactic method criminal use steal identity evolve A single statistic really convey full scope issue either
You may therefore interested know Most Common Identity Theft Complaints Â Identity Theft Complaints Year What infer statistic Â Well clear large number Americans victim identity theft However consider total number people also obvious identity theft common
In addition identity theft lead billion dollar loss year consumer necessarily hook full In fact financial institution assume liability fraud
The human imagination creativity endless come stealing thing say Peter Keane dean emeritus professor Golden Gate University College Law
In word following list represents common mean criminal use gain access personal information according FTC certainly exhaustive
As might guess based way identity thief access personal information commonsense step take protect There also measure might seem obvious lay already discussed thief steal identity well protect handle thing indeed discover fallen victim identity theft Â Who notify Â How mitigate damage Â And perhaps importantly get money good name back
There established procedure addressing identity theft typically includeÂ notifying Federal Trade Commission FTC well relevant government agency financial Below get general sense step mightÂ need take note specific differ slightly depending whether dealing unrecognized
After notified relevant authority need take care simple For example may want review financial account well personal information evidence identity theft provide In addition may need adjust automatic monthly payment direct deposit procedure potential identity theft cause domino effect headache across financial life
For tip make sure read guide
With consumer information readily available via Internet criminal engaged continuous game technological law enforcement fair wonder future hold financial security
Will sophisticated fraudsters able overcome advance voice fingerprint recognition technology ultimately becomes mainstream use
Will financial institution continue eat loss deriving unauthorized transaction liability shift consumer point
We asked number leading personal finance law enforcement information security expert next year store u identity theft standpoint response offer interesting insight future safety wallet
Identity theft fraud terrifying prospect consumer lead financial loss credit score damage
However type crime far le common might think reduce likelihood falling victim taking commonsense measure protect personal information
While exercising common sense always best defense identity thief hope advance identity verification also make life difficult criminal future
Take credit card transaction example
supposed identify person easy imagine deployment technology us camera perform facial recognition mic perform voice recognition say assistant professor informatics computing
technology expensive according assistant professor School Computing research going bring cost biometric measure bring identity theft Still expect identity theft disappear altogether part potential payoff always allure criminal part increasingly putting personal information online world see

By Senior Security Strategist Security Technology Unit Microsoft Corporation See
No matter kind technological procedural advancement occur certain principle computer science remain especially concerning information security
noticed lately among competing claim security vendor latest shiny box solve security woe basic understanding computer science fundamental missing
Because good computer science never loses importance knowing science help choose product develop process time time I cover topic column
This month like explore concept identity authentication authorization help understand important distinction help guard increasingly common tendency combine first two
start defining concept

A security principal computer typically want access system
Because system know yet need make declaration
Your answer question first thing present system want use
Some common example identity user IDs digital certificate include public key ATM card
A notable characteristic identity public way identity claim make claim using something publicly available

This answer question prove When present identity system system want prove indeed someone else
The system challenge must respond way
Common authenticator include password private key PINs
Whereas identity public authentication private secret known presumably
In case like password system also know secret
In case like PKI system need posse secret validate authenticity one many reason PKI superior
Your possession secret prof claim

Once successfully authenticated system system control resource allowed access
Typically use token ticket mechanism
The token ticket constrains ability roam freely throughout system
By authenticated identity subsequent access control decision allows access administrator determined necessary thus enforcing principle least privilege
To summarize Authorization well understood
trend merging identity authentication worry I want discus next
Consider system password
You log entering user ID
This work fine I suppose user system one else get
But multiuser system network
Someone else could simply enter user ID get access information
Generally user IDs also address rely fact user IDs secret
Also happens two people name
How create unique environment person
Consider system requires entering password user ID log
Passwords secret acting address work right
Well password serf double duty identifying authenticating problem arise
Say changing password unknown someone else already decided use password
You use
Indeed system probably raise error password already use
Please try What learned
The password someone account course
Now bad guy
Actually I know system attempt use password identifier however read presumably serious paper describing system without user IDs really great idea
Obviously I disagree
A system must maintain distinct mechanism identity authentication
Identity must unique one system domain necessarily world
Authenticators however unique secret
Both could using password neither know
Having pair hmm sound familiar
also make easier address theft
In system bad guy learns password change
You need go hassle getting brand new account
You revoke reassign password often wish
How would system handle situation
So add another column table Now consider biometrics
Given definition characteristic identity authentication biometrics identity authentication
Before answer question think attribute biometrics
Is public private
Public course
You leave various biometrics everywhere go fingerprint remain anything touch face stored countless surveillance system retina pattern known least optometrist perhaps
And believed although actual evidence support claim biometrics unique
How would one prove examining fingerprint retina every single individual planet
Given follows biometrics identity authentication despite claim vendor
Problems arise system begin using biometrics authentication
Say need swipe finger log additional factor
Your fingerprint serving identify prove
How system compromised
Very easily turn without secret accompanying fingerprint
Numerous research report shown biometric system spoofed notorious involves assistance Gummi Bear see
Another sobering example Malaysia hunting member violent gang chopped car finger get round security
Again secret accompanies finger need finger posse car
Here security countermeasure move risk car driver
This security becomes unsafe
Revocation present another challenge
If system relies biometric identity authentication revoke factor
Forgotten password changed lost smartcards revoked replaced
How revoke finger
Sure fun crack joke many chance get biometric authenticator get stolen
But reflects serious misunderstanding computer science manufacturer make claim biometrics simplify security
Smartcard manufacturer understand never enough insert card reader thus presenting something also must supply PIN something know unlock card
A stolen card public thing useless without PIN accompanying secret
Unfortunately gentleman Malaysia manufacturer security system misunderstood important principle
My general rule biometrics biometrics something effective remember combine second factor
Now colleague mine recently proposed might one possible exception general rule Imagine office hospital dozen people using common PC
The PC camera user logged left session running
The PC watch surroundings switch logged session corresponds person logged
The medical personnel want without touching machine want spread germ
The PC show selected person schedule time coming hour perhaps
interesting idea one I would support initial login followed general rule face identifier private key smartcard authenticator
Once present face smartcard system creates session keep displayed long face remains front camera
Once walk away session locked desktop cleared
When reappear front camera face unlocks session desktop reappears
If away computer beyond period session terminated access revoked
To use computer requires perform another complete login
Identity authentication distinct component step necessary use secure computer system
Identity without authentication lack proof authentication without identity invalidates auditing eliminates capability consider Windows supported password authenticator user ID
If biometrics become important begin considering strengthen identity authentication security strategy remember evaluate particular biometric implementation view
Proper biometrics identity accompanied like good identifier secret kind PIN private key smart card yes even password

Phishing act sending user falsely claiming established legitimate enterprise attempt scam user surrendering private information used identity theft
Phishing email typically direct user visit asked update personal information password credit card social security bank account number legitimate organization already
The website however bogus capture steal information user enters page see
saw proliferation phishing scam user received email supposedly eBay claiming user account suspended unless clicked provided email updated credit card information genuine eBay already
Because relatively simple make website look like legitimate organization site mimicking scam counted people tricked thinking actually contacted eBay subsequently going eBay site update account information
A global study released Working Group APWG suggests phishing email targeted major band including Apple PayPal Chinese marketplace Taobao indicating phishers update approach looking new victim niche industry segment
While million phishing URLs reported least unique phishing attack worldwide second half
Phishing email blindly sent thousand million recipient
By spamming large group people phisher count email read percentage people actually account legitimate company spoofed email corresponding webpage
Phishing also referred variation fishing idea bait thrown hope ignore bait tempted biting

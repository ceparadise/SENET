In process modifying software system make aspect work use fewer resource
In general may optimized executes rapidly capable operating le resource draw le power
Although word optimization share root optimal rare process optimization produce truly optimal system
The optimized system typically optimal one application one audience
One might reduce amount time program take perform task price making consume memory
In application memory space premium one might deliberately choose slower order use le memory
Often one size fit design work well case make optimize attribute greatest interest
Additionally effort required make piece software completely optimal incapable improvement almost always reasonable benefit would accrued process optimization may halted completely optimal solution reached
Fortunately often case greatest improvement come early process
Optimization occur number level
Typically higher level greater impact harder change later project requiring significant change complete rewrite need changed
Thus optimization typically proceed via refinement higher lower initial gain larger achieved le work later gain smaller requiring work
However case overall performance depends performance portion program small change late stage early consideration detail outsized impact
Typically consideration given efficiency throughout project though varies significantly major optimization often considered refinement done late ever
On project typically cycle optimization improving one area reveals limitation another typically curtailed performance acceptable gain become small costly
As performance part specification program program unusably slow fit purpose video game Hz acceptable unacceptably choppy performance consideration start ensure system able deliver sufficient performance early prototype need roughly acceptable performance confidence final system optimization achieve acceptable performance
This sometimes omitted belief optimization always done later resulting prototype system far slow often order magnitude factor system ultimately failure architecturally achieve performance goal one take year work achieve acceptable performance Java achieved acceptable performance
The degree performance change prototype production system amenable optimization significant source uncertainty risk
At highest level design may optimized make best use available resource given goal constraint expected
The architectural design system overwhelmingly affect performance
For example system network network latency main constraint overall performance would optimized minimize network trip ideally making single request request rather multiple roundtrips
Choice design depends goal designing fast compilation key priority faster assuming work speed output code goal slower compiler fulfills goal better even though take longer
Choice platform programming language occur level changing frequently requires complete rewrite though modular system may allow rewrite component example Python program may rewrite section In distributed system choice architecture etc
occurs design level may difficult change particularly component replaced sync old client
Given overall design good choice efficient implementation algorithm data structure come next
After design choice data structure affect efficiency aspect program
Generally data structure difficult change algorithm data structure assumption performance assumption used throughout program though minimized use abstract data type function definition keeping concrete data structure definition restricted place
For algorithm primarily consists ensuring algorithm constant O logarithmic O log linear O case O log input space time
Algorithms quadratic complexity O fail scale even linear algorithm cause problem repeatedly called typically replaced constant logarithmic possible
Beyond asymptotic order growth constant factor matter asymptotically slower algorithm may faster smaller simpler asymptotically faster algorithm faced small input may case occurs reality
Often provide best performance due tradeoff changing size
A general technique improve performance avoid work
A good example use common case improving performance avoiding unnecessary work
For example using simple text layout algorithm Latin text switching complex layout algorithm complex script
Another important technique caching particularly avoids redundant computation
Because importance caching often many level caching system cause problem memory use correctness issue stale cache
Beyond general algorithm implementation abstract machine concrete source code level choice make significant difference
For example early C compiler slower unconditional loop evaluated conditional jump tested true unconditional jump
Some optimization one nowadays performed
This depends source language target machine language compiler difficult understand predict change time key place understanding compiler machine code improve performance
example optimization reduce need auxiliary variable even result faster performance avoiding optimization
Between source compile level used tune performance option source code compiler respectively using defines disable unneeded software feature optimizing specific processor model hardware capability predicting branching instance
software distribution system take advantage form optimization
Use tends ensure optimized least much compiler predict
At lowest level writing code using designed particular hardware platform produce efficient compact code programmer take advantage full repertoire
Many used traditionally written assembler code reason
Programs small program seldom written start finish assembly due time cost involved
Most compiled high level language assembly hand optimized
When efficiency size le important large part may written language
With modern greater complexity recent harder write efficient code compiler generates project need ultimate optimization step
Much code written today intended run many machine possible
As consequence programmer compiler always take advantage efficient instruction provided newer CPUs quirk older model
Additionally assembly code tuned particular processor without using instruction might still suboptimal different processor expecting different tuning code
Typically today rather writing assembly language programmer use analyze output compiler change source code compiled efficiently understand inefficient
compiler produce customized machine code based data cost compilation overhead
This technique date earliest engine become widespread Java HotSpot JavaScript
In case may able perform optimization exceeding capability static compiler dynamically adjusting parameter according actual input factor
AOT compilation optimization technique based runtime profile similar static average case analog dynamic technique adaptive optimization
alter response run time condition order optimize code common assembly language program
Some perform optimization runtime
Some example include
Compilers help program take advantage CPU feature example
Code optimization also broadly categorized technique
While latter one effective platform technique use specific property one platform rely parameter depending single platform even single processor
Writing producing different version code different processor might therefore needed
For instance case optimization technique generic technique reduction function call memory efficient routine reduction condition etc
impact CPU architecture similar way
Generally serve reduce total required complete program reduce total memory usage process
On hand technique involve instruction scheduling parallelism parallelism cache optimization technique parameter differ among various platform optimal instruction scheduling might different even different processor architecture
Computational task performed several different way varying efficiency
A efficient version equivalent functionality known
For example consider following code snippet whose intention obtain sum integer N This code assuming rewritten using mathematical formula like The optimization sometimes performed automatically optimizing compiler select method computationally efficient retaining functionality
See discussion technique
However significant improvement performance often achieved removing extraneous functionality
Optimization always obvious intuitive process
In example optimized version might actually slower original version N sufficiently small particular hardware happens much faster performing addition operation multiplication division
In case however optimization relies using elaborate algorithm making use special case special trick performing complex
A fully optimized program might difficult comprehend hence may contain unoptimized version
Beyond eliminating obvious antipatterns code level optimization decrease maintainability
Optimization generally focus improving one two aspect performance execution time memory usage disk space bandwidth power consumption resource
This usually require one factor optimized expense others
For example increasing size improves runtime performance also increase memory consumption
Other common include code clarity conciseness
There instance programmer performing optimization must decide make software better operation cost making operation le efficient
These may sometimes nature competitor published result must beaten order improve commercial success come perhaps burden making normal usage software le efficient
Such change sometimes jokingly referred
Optimization may include finding system component limiting factor performance
In term code often critical part code primary consumer needed resource though another factor latency network bandwidth
In computer science resource consumption often follows form distribution applied resource optimization observing resource typically used operation
In software engineering often better approximation execution time computer program spent executing code known law context
More complex algorithm data structure perform well many item simple algorithm suitable small amount data setup initialization time constant factor complex algorithm outweigh benefit thus may faster single algorithm
A performance profiler used narrow decision functionality fit condition
In case adding help make program run faster
For example filtering program commonly read line filter output line immediately
This us enough memory one line performance typically poor due latency disk read
Performance greatly improved reading entire file writing filtered result though us much memory
Caching result similarly effective though also requiring larger memory use
Optimization reduce add code used improve
This may complicate program system making harder maintain debug
As result optimization performance tuning often performed end
made following two statement optimization We forget small efficiency say time premature optimization root evil
Yet pas opportunity critical In established engineering discipline improvement easily obtained never considered marginal I believe viewpoint prevail software engineering Premature optimization phrase used describe situation programmer let performance consideration affect design piece code
This result design clean could code incorrect code complicated optimization programmer distracted optimizing
When deciding whether optimize specific part program always considered impact overall program depends much much time actually spent specific part always clear looking code without
A better approach therefore design first code design resulting code see part optimized
A simple elegant design often easier optimize stage profiling may reveal unexpected performance problem would addressed premature optimization
In practice often necessary keep performance goal mind first designing software programmer balance goal design optimization
Modern compiler operating system efficient intended performance increase often fail materialize
As example caching data application level cached operating system level yield improvement execution
Even rare case programmer remove failed optimization production code
It also true advance hardware often obviate potential improvement yet obscuring code persist future long purpose negated
Optimization code development using take different form different language
In procedural language macro implemented using token substitution
Nowadays used alternative many case
In case inlined function body undergo optimization compiler including may move computation compile time
In many language macro implemented using substitution parse syntax tree claimed make safer use
Since many case interpretation used one way ensure computation performed sometimes way
originated style macro macro often called macro
A similar effect achieved using
In case work moved
The difference macro one side macro side latter tool allow performing arbitrary computation expansion macro perform computation relies optimizer ability perform
Additionally macro directly support
As optimization however often difficult predict tool impact project complete
Optimization automated compiler performed programmer
Gains usually limited local optimization larger global optimization
Usually powerful optimization find superior
Optimizing whole system usually undertaken programmer complex automated optimizers
In situation programmer system administrator explicitly change code overall system performs better
Although produce better efficiency far expensive automated optimization
Use find section program taking resource
Programmers sometimes believe clear idea bottleneck intuition frequently wrong
Optimizing unimportant piece code typically little help overall performance
When bottleneck localized optimization usually start rethinking algorithm used program
More often particular algorithm specifically tailored particular problem yielding better performance generic algorithm
For example task sorting huge list item usually done routine one efficient generic algorithm
But characteristic item exploitable example already arranged particular order different method used even sort routine
After programmer reasonably sure best algorithm selected code optimization start
Loops unrolled lower loop overhead although often lead speed overload data type small possible used integer arithmetic used instead
See article technique
Performance bottleneck due language limitation rather algorithm data structure used program
Sometimes critical part program different give direct access underlying machine
For example common language like module written greater speed
Programs already written C module written
Programs written use
Rewriting section pay circumstance general known state time spent code time remaining code
So putting intellectual effort optimizing small part program huge effect overall speed correct part located
Manual optimization sometimes side effect undermining readability
Thus code optimization carefully documented preferably using comment effect future development evaluated
The program performs automated optimization called
Most optimizers embedded compiler operate compilation
Optimizers often tailor generated code specific processor
Today automated optimization almost exclusively limited
However compiler optimization usually limited fixed set rather general optimization considerable demand optimizers accept description problem optimization allowing engineer specify custom optimization
Tools accept description optimization called system beginning applied real software system
Some language optimize program using
aim optimize whole system moving task computer high usage computer idle time
Sometimes time taken undertake optimization therein may issue
Optimizing existing code usually add new feature worse might add new previously working code change might
Because manually optimized code might sometimes le readability unoptimized code optimization might impact maintainability well
Optimization come price important sure investment worthwhile
An automatic optimizer program performs code optimization may optimized either improve efficiency target program else speed operation
A compilation performed optimization turned usually take longer although usually problem program quite large
In particular performance compile component executing together target code key improving overall execution speed

broadly known consists tailoring service product accommodate specific individual sometimes tied group segment individual
A wide variety organization use personalization improve digital sale conversion marketing result branding improved website metric well
Personalization key element
personalized based characteristic interest social category context etc
action click button open link etc
intent make purchase check status entity parameter identified associated individual therefore providing tailored user experience
Note experience rarely simply accommodation user relationship user desire site designer driving specific action achieve objective
Increase sale conversion page
The term often used site us explicit data product rating user preference
Technically web personalization achieved associating visitor segment predefined action
Customizing user experience based behavioural contextual technical data proven positive impact conversion rate optimization effort
Associated action range changing content webpage presenting modal display presenting interstitials triggering personalized email even automating phone call user
According study research firm Econsultancy le website invested field web personalization
However many company offer service web personalization well web email recommendation system based personalization user behaviour
There many category web personalization including There several camp defining executing web personalization
A broad method web personalization may include With implicit personalization web personalization performed based different category mentioned
It also learned direct interaction user based implicit data item purchased page viewed
With explicit personalization web page information system changed user using feature provided system
Hybrid personalization combine two approach leverage
Web personalization linked notion AH
The main difference former would usually work considered open corpus hypermedia whilst latter would traditionally work closed corpus hypermedia
However recent research direction AH domain take closed open corpus account
Thus two field closely
Personalization also considered use le overtly commercial application improve user experience online
Internet activist documented search engine like give different result different people even logged
He also point social medium site change user friend feed based think want see
Pariser warns algorithm create prevents people encountering diversity viewpoint beyond present fact confirm existing view
On personalization often based user attribute department functional area role
The term customization context refers ability user modify page layout specify content displayed
Another aspect personalization increasing prevalence Web
Many company make data available Web via web service standard
One example Ordnance Survey Open Data
Data made available way structured allow third party
Data available user personal accessed suited fit personalized
Current standard Web include Over time mobile phone seen increased emphasis placed user personalization
Far black white screen monophonic ringtones past phone offer interactive wallpaper TruTones
In UK Asia WeeMees become popular
WeeMees character used wallpaper respond tendency user
Video Graphics Array VGA picture quality allows people change background ease without sacrificing quality
All service downloaded provider goal make user feel connected phone
In print medium ranging personalization us database individual recipient information
Not written document address name reader advertising targeted recipient demographic interest using field within database first name last name company etc
The term personalization confused variable data much granular method marketing leverage image text medium field within database
Although personalized child book created company using leveraging strength
This allows full image text variability within printed book
With advent online printing service Shapeways Ponoko seeing personalization enter realm product design
Promotional item etc
regularly personalized
Personalized child child becomes name image child also popular
Personalized CDs child also exist
With advent personalized calendar start month birthday card card poster photo book also obtained
printing production method allows create unique personalized item global scale
Personalized apparel accessory jewellery increasing popularity
This kind customization also relevant area like Consumer Electronics Retail
By combining printing complex software product easily customized
Mass personalization defined custom tailoring company accordance end user taste preference
From collaborative engineering perspective mass customization viewed collaborative effort customer manufacturer different set priority need jointly search solution best match customer individual specific need manufacturer customization capability
The main difference mass customization mass personalization customization ability company give customer opportunity create choose product certain specification limit
One example mass personalization A website knowing user location buying habit offer suggestion tailored user demographic
Each user classified relevant trait location age forth given personalization aimed group
This mean personalization individual singular user pinpoint specific trait match larger group people
represents concept similar mass personalization
Predictive personalization defined ability predict customer behavior need want tailor offer communication precisely
Social data one source providing predictive analysis particularly social data structured
Predictive personalization much recent mean personalization used well augment current personalization offering
Digital also personalized
change content map based previous search profile information
Technology writer criticized map personalization threat

I read algorithm LR k parser frequent mention selecting handle grammar given
For example one document said Please help understand handle parsing
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Let consider following grammar S A b S B b A B Obviously language totally uninteresting word aab aaab
However grammar LL LL sure know problem
Let try parsing input aaab going one character time pretending know absolutely nothing rest string except next token essentially use token lookahead
We allowed use knowledge everything seen far though
Initially know string start
This tell u absolutely nothing whether production production grammar
Luckily really care point
Let skip go next point
We remember look next token
This another
Note seen aa mean might case might case first two constitute instance A
We leave moment first officially
We look third token find
We want decide whether two saw earlier really constitute A LR k algorithm never delay decision
As A always followed b decide case next token
Reading know definitely case assuming input correct
Our lookahead becomes b precisely expect
We therefore decide three seen far fact B
Note point longer need seen three need know seen B
This effectively situation would Bb input read B make everything easier remember precisely corresponds reduce action LR k parser
Finishing read b find end input decide left part must S decide input correct
The LR k algorithm work pretty much described
It remembers seen far decides based information next token whether last bit seen far nonterminal
It replaces nonterminal shuffle information around continues replacement taken place input
The crucial bit finding seen far precise last bit seen far actually instance nonterminal expansion production
In example transformed two start A everything would went wrong
We say aa handle point
However aaa handle correctly replaced B
A grammar LR k always make correct decision handle using k token lookahead everything seen far

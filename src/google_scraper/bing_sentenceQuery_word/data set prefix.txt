A string occurs
For example best substring It best time
This confused substring
For example Itwastimes subsequence It best time substring
special case substring
A prefix string substring occurs
A suffix string substring occurs
The list substring string would
A substring factor string string
A substring string prefix suffix string equivalently suffix prefix
If substring also general concept
Given pattern find occurrence string
Finding longest string equal substring two string known
Example The string equal substring subsequence two different offset In mathematical literature substring also called America Europe
Not including empty substring number substring string length symbol occur number way choose two distinct place symbol substring
Including beginning end string place
So substring
A prefix string string
A string equal string source addition restrict proper prefix
A prefix seen special case substring
Example The string equal prefix substring subsequence string The square subset symbol sometimes used indicate prefix denotes prefix
This defines string called particular kind
In term also commonly understood set prefix string respect language
See article detail
A suffix string substring string includes last letter including
A string equal string
A restricted interpretation also empty
A suffix seen special case substring
Example The string equal suffix substring subsequence string A string represents suffix
Suffix tree large number application
The simplified version data structure list start position suffix alphabetically sorted order many application
A border suffix prefix string
bab border babab also babooneatingakebab
Given set string set single string contains every string substring
For example concatenation string order give trivial superstring
For interesting example let
Then superstring another shorter superstring
Generally interested finding superstring whose length small

I need advice
There section CONCLUDING REMARKS paper term autho paper use PREFIX CODING COMMUNICATION
I googled expression result paper
It difficult beginner communication complexity understand author talking explain use prefix code solving set intersection problem
He writes assigning appropriate prefix code message
His explanation vague
Thanks advance ever advice
Communication Complexity Data Compression Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
The author describes algorithm due Ahlswede Cai solve set intersection problem describes generalization setting number player
I describe two player setting
Ahlswede Cai consider algorithm following form
Alice get set X Bob get set Y
Then two round Alice sends Bob description X
Bob sends Alice description X Y
It remains determine encoding X X Y
For second round thing simple x X Bob sends bit describing whether x Y total bit
The first round complicated
One option always send entire set X way cost n bit
This algorithm us bit worst case X
Another option use complicated encoding scheme
One thing scheme accomplish Alice finish sending message Bob know turn speak
This happens set message Alice sends form prefix code
Suppose length codeword Alice sends input A
The communication complexity protocol
On hand Kraft inequality state prefix code exists
Now suppose aiming communication complexity L bit
Then need L n k
This show L n
Conversely L n code exists get communication protocol complexity
It happens complexity optimal
Ahlwede Cai prove using rank bound state communication complexity least logarithm sum rank matrix x given x input x output z x otherwise
When matrix pmatrix pmatrix pmatrix pmatrix get communication least
More generally identity x using tensor product notation easily follows rank x equal Hamming weight z
The rank lower bound n matching algorithm
The exact communication complexity set intersection therefore n amortized communication complexity
This better running best protocol parallel would result bit
Ahlswede Cai protocol thus sense compress communication
Recently advent information complexity resulted much improved understanding amortized complexity especially randomized case small error allowed
In case amortized complexity exactly equal information complexity
In fact small error allowed show amortized complexity drop bit
They also compute amortized complexity set disjointness
An outstanding open problem finding similar formula complexity direct product function current technique work small error allowed

I trying understand definition Prefix free I understand definition example wikipedia provides
I hoping clarification
Below excerpt wikipedia http A prefix code type code system typically code distinguished possession prefix property state valid code word system prefix start valid code word set
For example code code word prefix property code consisting prefix
With prefix code receiver identify word without requiring special marker word
I understand prefix property I understand first set satisfies prefix property second fails since set element set
Could someone explain prefix property explain example I confused provide another example
Suppose simple code consisting three word cat catapult camel
This set codewords whole codeword namely cat also prefix another codeword
Here fake illustration problem cause
Suppose cat encodes run like catapult encodes good time catenary encodes dinner
Imagine codewords come kind slowly letter letter
If get letter c know might complete message better stop staring computer screen get fast maybe beginning another codeword better wait
Suppose contrast codewords catch catapult catenary catamount
This collection codewords since whole codeword beginning part another codeword
If c even c come know wait order get message
At programming level suppose letter come steady stream separated codewords
You want able separate stream letter codewords fly
If cat catapult codewords see cat ca make decision see next letter
That first example
In second example problem see cat know codeword list wait rest
There good reason use code
For example suppose message overwhelmingly consist numerical information brief piece text
Then increase throughput lot encode digit short bit string letter alphabet longer bit string
In language meant interpreted computer often convenient property mean use simpler parser
A parser fair amount looking ahead order interpret string decrease efficiency
An example set codewords boundary word ca determined set cat catsup supply ply
If get message catsupply ca tell mean cat supply catsup ply
The issue Nicolas example caused set message formed concatenating codewords different whether set codewords
It possible either property hold without neither depending concatenation codewords considered valid message
For example could add codeword endoftransmission require every message end definition message set message constructed codewords cat catapult endoftransmission even though set codewords
Alternatively set codewords b need restriction constitutes message set message aa message

I writing kind calculator using Jflex CUP I able make grammar infix postfix prefix notation seen work well I use grammar combine
The problem I combine without getting error I day I ca really figure
The main problem F NUMBER E NUMBER error I also tried adding rule try mitigate error I getting correctly
Take note also I able combine combination two three
One approach I try merge prefix postfix infix changing E T creating new Rule T I still It would helpful someone could give explanation I try combine

I learning Clojure looking Scheme CL introduced world prefix notation
At first I like still starting grow
To honest though still long calculation difficult understand I think issue needing I get
But lead question Which type notation prefer
I find infix notation easier read simply I working ever since kindergarten
I preference
I work well either
Not many programmer realize prefix notation actually norm infix oddball
After every language us prefix notation call
It relatively small number arithmetic logic operator infix
The look system mathematical symbol screwy see
Some infix postfix x prefix tan x ratio fraction overfix
It simple PEMDAS
I like prefix thing infix thing postfix thing mixfix like thing What I like language let express thing way read naturally
I like Prefix simply operator precedence explicit
FYI Longer calculation really chain operation Clojure broken using macro

equivalent While macro prepends prior result argument next expression appends
This typically handy used function expect collection seqs Providing facility easily composing simpler operation compound one like one Clojure big advantage
For additional reading check later post topic
Of two prefix postfix could used way language I know use PS Forth
I vastly prefer prefix I reading code
But infix thinking code
Postfix
It clearly commonly used procedural language object oriented language
Sequential code postfix notation OO code postfix Most OO procedural language used convention heavily mixed bit infix maybe prefix lighten cognitive load increase pattern recognition
Even functional language use postfix like format commonly way make le comprehensible prefix version easier read factorisation please imagine longer nasty chain application It depends binary operator order important asymmetric benefit infix notation easier distinguish way round operator evaluated
compared symmetric operator le issue indeed sometimes expanded operator pre post fix notation associative
v I prefer prefix like yoda talk last essence favoured infix associative operation By posting answer agree

I created hundred temporary data set use macro
All data set start prefix case
Once I combined data set I would like drop temporary table created macro
How I drop temporary data set without listing individual data set
The method used DATA step work PROC SQL step
There many temporary table list
Thanks Suavis Christos Avrillionis answer elegant I still like mention existence system table
With list table use whatever favorite method like start deleting
I SAS license home I tested code

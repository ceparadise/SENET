Acronyms Abbreviations Terms And Definitions What exactly definition baseline depends role perspective SDLC Software Development Life Cycle process
The baseline concept play many aspect SDLC execution including project management configuration management others
Additionally baseline concept practice applicable SLDC methodology including limit Agile Model Waterfall Model Iterative Model Spiral Model
A baseline reference point software development life cycle marked completion formal approval set predefined work product phase completion
The objective baseline reduce project vulnerability uncontrolled change provide point time set artifact reference recovery necessary
Baselining artifact requirement specification matrix design code data model etc
move formal change control usually one repository tool milestone achievement point development life cycle
Baselines also used identify essential software hardware configuration assembly component make specific release system

In baseline agreed description attribute product point time serf basis defining change
A change movement baseline next state
The identification significant change baseline state central purpose identification
Typically significant state receive formal approval status either explicitly implicitly
An approval status may marked individually prior definition status established project leader signified association position established baseline
Nevertheless approval status usually recognized publicly
Thus baseline may also mark approved configuration item
signed execution
In similar manner associating multiple configuration item baseline indicates item approved
Generally baseline may single work product set work product used logical basis comparison
A baseline may also established basis subsequent select activity work product meet certain criterion
Such activity may attributed formal approval
Conversely configuration project often includes one baseline status configuration metric collected
The current configuration refers current status current audit current metric
Similarly le frequently baseline may refer item associated specific project
This may include revision item latest revision item project depending upon context
A baseline may specific type baseline body item particular certifying
Some example include While marking approval status cover majority us baseline baseline may also established signify progress work passage time
In case baseline visible measure endured collective effort
developmental baseline
Baselines may also mark
Baselines valued use identify notable state work product also provide historical view work product element proceeded together time
When historical baseline retrieved state work product subset share significance history change allows project leader compare relative progress single part project project whole allows project leader identify individual item lag lead progress toward better functionality performance
For reason baseline identification monitoring retrieval critical success configuration management
Once retrieved baseline may compared particular configuration another baseline
Most baseline established fixed point time serve continue reference point identification state
However baseline established carry forward reference item regardless change item
These latter baseline evolve progression work effort continue identify notable work product project
In process performing configuration management configuration item work product may assigned baseline establish certain status
In sense baseline work product may require certain change work product ensure conforms characteristic associated baseline referenced
This varies upon context many case requires work product reset initial possibly inherently approved state work may proceed
In many environment baseline controlled certain subsequent activity work product baseline either prohibited permitted
These activity selected controlled depending upon configuration management system also monitored
Consequently baseline ordinarily subjected configuration management audit
may include examination specific action performed baseline identification individual involved action evaluation change within baseline certification approval accounting metric collection comparison another baseline
Though common software system label existence baseline found several domain
Baselines found modeling system business rule management system among others
In addition field hardware software engineering baseline found medicine
monitoring health progress politics
statistic physic chemistry
observation change finance
others

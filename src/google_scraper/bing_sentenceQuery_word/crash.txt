In occurs computer program stop functioning properly
The program responsible may appear report crash detail relating
If program critical part operating system entire system may crash often resulting
Most crash result executing invalid
Typical cause include incorrect value overwriting portion affected program code due earlier accessing invalid memory address using triggering unhandled
The original software bug started chain event typically considered cause crash discovered process
The original bug far removed actually crashed
In earlier personal computer attempting write data hardware address outside system main memory could cause hardware damage
Some crash allow malicious program execute allowing replication acquisition data would normally inaccessible
An typically crash performs operation allowed operating system
The operating system trigger application
Unix application traditionally responded signal
Most Windows Unix application respond displaying dialogue box one shown right option attach one installed
Some application attempt recover error continue running instead
Typical error result application crash include The software running behind website may crash rendering inaccessible entirely providing error message instead normal content
For example site using SQL database script SQL database server crash display connection error
An operating system crash commonly occurs occurs
Operating system crash also occur internal logic within operating system detects operating system lost internal
Modern operating system usually remain unharmed application program crash
Many software bug cause crash also type
For example overwrite return address subroutine invalid value cause subroutine return
However exploit overwrites return address valid value code address executed

Hello world
Welcome Crash Course Computer Science
So today going take look origin even though digital computer relatively new need computation
Since start civilization human increasing need special device help manage laborious task scale society continued grow computational device began play crucial role amplifying mental ability
From abacus astrolabe difference engine tabulating machine come long way satisfying increasing need process completely transformed commerce government daily life

I seen mentioned elsewhere yet Carrie Anne Philbin Raspberry Pi Foundation collaboration PBS Digital Studios appears created crash course computer science YouTube
May interest STEM community
one Dave I surprised many member latched one
Maybe case promote better
possibly elementary generic subject area majority member especially involved directly STEM education
Perhaps another YouTube course resource worth mentioning Bruce Land AVR microcontroller lecture may interest wanting progress Arduino environment working bare bone Atmel AVR
It lecture capture series Cornell University ECE Designing Microcontrollers course The quality video production bit rough around edge content informative lecturer style quite entertaining time
It bit course Atmel Getting Started With AVR series There also appears recent version ECE course interested microcontroller family May interest member
The ECE student final project list may also interest well Those observing closely may even recognise someone course Nice post Dave
About twenty year ago I put together full engineering training course CMMI compliant office
I lot fun taught lot put together exercise challenge student think needed preferred method deciding technical approach document decision
One greatest evil time notion anyone could learn programming language could write software
Coding le effort need go quality software
I hope STEM course provides lesson
Otherwise get another generation people work qualified
DAB I really appreciate comment coding versus total time proper software engineering
Too much emphasis put coding code
Very educational site example give thought discipline process
When I worked younger folk I tried orient way Footnote cryptography security It developed immediately challenged code review unit testing
No BS adding later
My beginning time punched card paper tape
Back project nearly always Assembly Language
Even Fortran Cobol project forced manage time well
If rushed construction made huge mess even application level
It gratifying bit tutoring using simple analogy young newbie could figure investment time front payed downstream
Yes I sometimes tell newbie must make haste slowly
Up front planning make entire project easier cheaper
In forty year working field nobody ever proven quality job without following process
They may create something fast seldom maintained expanded without complete redesign rewrite
You either pay front pay ten time much later
Why difficult decision
Good luck class
Let know I help

Illustration Christoph Niemann Illustration Christoph Niemann Rose Iqaluit Nunavut Canada All computer lock crash operating system immune matter fact crashed wrote answer singling specific reason oversimplifies issue explains Daniel Jackson computer science professor Massachusetts Institute Technology
The underlying cause Jackson say hardware software developer trying bring product market Internet time hyperfast
The result Quality reliability suffer
Consider operating system
These enormous program written hundred programmer contain million line code
Bringing work many people together daunting end result rarely perfect
To find software glitch developer hire tester program nearly complete
When problem found programming equivalent written correct
They indeed stop crash original code never deleted
Also Jackson say testing emphasize flaw
There three main source crash application device driver operating system
The vast majority caused first two
An application often fails try access modify another program memory example Microsoft Word began using memory space reserved Microsoft Excel
This scenario akin chess game one player start moving player player judge notice game
The failure word processing browser program theoretically cause entire computer crash often
That operating system like aforementioned judge
It notice one application modifying another application blow whistle longer vouch integrity computer
Different operating system respond problem different way
Older version Windows example respond blue screen death
More robust operating system Windows XP Linux build virtual wall around application even one program perform intended disrupt program cause entire computer freeze
Device driver program allow operating system communicate computer hardware
Bugs often discovered product released common manufacturer release updated driver year piece hardware introduced
Newer application program come mind usually require driver
To help eliminate freeze Windows Microsoft asserts time reliable older check status driver
Drivers older computer found manufacturer Web site
Your operating system rarely cause crash directly several way might
It could example misplace program computer memory
Unable verify content memory soon becomes unstable
bug also exacerbated hardware software

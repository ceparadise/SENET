A special computer designed technical application
Intended primarily used one person time commonly connected run
The term also used loosely refer everything terminal PC connected common form refers group hardware offered several current defunct company opened door graphic animation revolution late
Workstations offered higher performance mainstream especially respect memory capacity multitasking capability
Workstations optimized manipulation different type complex data mechanical design engineering simulation animation rendering image mathematical plot
Typically consist high resolution display minimum also offer multiple display mouse device manipulating object navigating scene etc
Workstations first segment computer market present advanced accessory
The increasing capability mainstream PCs late blurred line somewhat workstation
The workstation market previously employed proprietary hardware made distinct PCs instance IBM used CPUs workstation Intel CPUs PCs
However early difference disappeared workstation use highly hardware dominated large PC vendor later selling system running architecture Intel AMD CPUs
Perhaps first computer might qualify workstation small scientific computer designed used interactively single person sitting console
It introduced
One peculiar feature machine lacked actual arithmetic circuitry
To perform addition required table decimal addition rule
This saved cost logic circuitry enabling IBM make inexpensive
The machine CADET rented initially month
In IBM introduced scientific computer meant successor
Both system came ability run program written language
Both built roughly cabinet
Both available disk drive printer
A console typewriter direct interaction standard
Early example workstation generally dedicated system designed support number user would instead reserved exclusively one person
A notable example regarded first commercial minicomputer
The developed early pioneered principle workstation computer networked system intended heavily interactive use
Lisp Machines commercialized beginning company like workstation
The first computer designed graphic facility workstation modern sense term developed
Other early workstation include later
In early advent number new participant field appeared including created workstation based processor
Meanwhile created several spinoff graphic product well notably range machine followed
It uncommon differentiate target market product Sun Apollo considered SGI machine
As microprocessor became available adopted many workstation vendor
Workstations tended expensive typically several time cost standard PC sometimes costing much new
However minicomputer sometimes cost much house
The high expense usually came using costlier component ran faster found local computer store well inclusion feature found PCs time networking sophisticated graphic
Workstation manufacturer also tend take balanced approach system design making certain avoid bottleneck data flow unimpeded many different subsystem within computer
Additionally workstation given specialized nature tend higher PCs
The system come workstation company often feature disk storage system single multiple large amount cooling
Additionally company make product tend good plan
However line workstation PC increasingly becoming blurred demand fast computer networking graphic become common consumer world allowing workstation manufacturer use shelf PC component graphic solution opposed developed technology
Some workstation still expensive PC standard offer binary compatibility workstation server made vendor
This allows software development take place relative server desktop machine
Graphics workstation
machine often shipped
There several attempt produce specifically lowest possible price point opposed performance
One approach remove local storage reduce machine processor keyboard mouse screen
In case would still run traditional operating system perform computation locally storage remote
These approach intended reduce initial system purchase cost lower reducing amount administration required per user
This approach actually first attempted replacement PCs office productivity application early example filled similar role technical computing
Sun also introduced notably product line
However traditional workstation PCs continue drop price tends undercut market product type
In early workstation meet three Ms
The egabyte memory egapixel display roughly compute performance least one million floating point operation per second
As limited seems today least order magnitude beyond capacity personal computer time original KB memory display performance around kiloFLOPS kiloFLOPS optional math coprocessor
Other desirable feature found desktop computer time included networking graphic acceleration internal peripheral data bus
Another goal bring price system egapenny le achieved late although many workstation particularly still cost anywhere throughout early
The widespread adoption technology mainstream PCs direct factor decline workstation separate market segment Since turn millennium definition workstation blurred extent
Many component used workstation used consumer market price differential lower end workstation consumer PCs narrower certain case consumer market enthusiast game market difficult tell qualifies desktop PC workstation
In another instance graphic card spawned GPU different driver support certification tailored unique requirement CAD application retailed much higher price many took using GeForce workstation card since hardware largely capable plus could unlock feature nominally exclusive Quadro
Workstations typically driver advancement CPU technology
Although consumer desktop workstation benefit CPUs designed around multicore concept essentially multiple processor application IBM pioneer modern workstation typically use multiple multicore CPUs error correcting memory much larger cache found CPUs
Such power reliability normally required general desktop computer
IBM processor board Xeon processor board example multiple CPUs cache ECC memory feature suited demanding engineering scientific work general desktop computing
Some workstation designed use one specific application etc
To ensure compatibility software purchaser usually ask certificate software vendor
The certification process make workstation price jump several notch professional purpose reliability important initial purchase cost
As January workstation product line discontinued The current workstation market us microprocessor
Operating system available platform include various formerly known OS X
Some vendor also market commodity mono socket system workstation
Three type product marketed workstation umbrella A significant segment desktop market computer expected perform workstation using PC operating system component
Component manufacturer often segment product line market premium component functionally similar cheaper consumer model feature higher level robustness performance
A workstation class PC may following feature

A type used engineering development type application require moderate amount computing power relatively high quality capability
Workstations generally come large graphic screen least MB
Most workstation also special type workstation called come without disk drive
The common workstation
In term computing power workstation lie although line fuzzy end
personal computer equivalent workstation
And workstation equivalent minicomputer
Like personal computer workstation computer
However workstation typically linked together form although also used
In networking refers computer connected network

system basically designed single user advanced graphic capability large storage capacity powerful central processing unit
A workstation capable PC le advanced midrange computer manage large network PCs workstation handle immense reporting task
The term workstation also sometimes ascribed dumb terminal without processing capacity connected computer
Most workstation employ reduced instruction set computing architecture opposed complex instruction set computing CISC used PCs
Because reduces number instruction permanently stored microprocessor RISC architecture streamlines accelerates
A feature run workstation must include instruction complexity application
Workstation microprocessor typically offer addressing indicative speed compared exponentially slower system found PCs
Some advanced workstation employ processor posse four billion time capacity machine
Their raw processing power allows workstation accommodate graphic interface sophisticated multitask software advanced ability communicate computer
Workstations used primarily perform computationally intensive scientific engineering task
They also found favour complex financial business application
In addition workstation often serve network attached client PCs use resident tool application access manipulate data stored workstation
The workstation developed United States Apollo space program introduced commercially
The chief delineation PCs workstation traditionally latter advanced graphic capability
But advanced graphic interface powerful microprocessor RISC PCs make barely distinguishable workstation
Likewise workstation closely mimic processing prowess midrange computer system
distinguish scientific workstation personal computer
The former used powerful microprocessor available colour graphic capability costing thousand dollar
They used scientist computation data visualization engineer engineering
Today distinction workstation position stifle competition
While personal computer market grew matured variation theme grew university lab began threaten minicomputer market

In earlier day marked difference workstation home computer
Both microcomputer workstation typically powerful available home market
This workstation part office LAN thus connected large central server
The central server could thus hold larger amount data perform complex operation server larger powerful computer
Nowadays though advance home desktop decline price microcomputer blurred line workstation home desktop
What typically encounter workplace environment much different available personal use except still connected LAN
Specialized industry radiologist workstation hospital however still high end equipment workstation connected hospital network allows create fancy image see medical drama
I think fundamental difference use network
In building identical workstation assuming identical access level software whichever machine log provides identical environment
IT support consultant
These day word workstation used primarily distinguish computer used server nothing else
It role machine organization hardware spec
Workstations type Desktop PC
They made used specialized computer
Some extra memory program use
Some strong brain processor
Some special video card
But still type desktop PC
note It hard stick term dive tech
As lurker I use Reddit practice talking customer family
As others said difference pretty much moot day
Workstations machine ie server used work
CAD software circuit design mathematical modeling programming graphic design animation example task use workstation
Just running office suite checking email would use
A simple example pull Apple product line
The Mini desktop machine
The Mac Pro workstation
Where standard PC day RAM workstation might I machine year ago
A standard PC single dual quad core CPU workstation processor
edit OK I AM WRONG There still application really powerful workstation needed For example CAD workstation load RAM powerful graphic card multiple screen would required ordinary office PC
Programmers work FPGAs kind special programmable chip might want powerful CPUs building software downloading chip take long slow PCs imagine waiting minute every time want test program suck
Opposite way around correct
Its quite opposite actually

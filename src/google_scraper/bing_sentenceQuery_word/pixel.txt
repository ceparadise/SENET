How matrix work
Do I need multiple every single pixel
How upperleft upperright bottomleft bottomleft pixel surrounding pixel
And matrix work left right bottom bottom first left right
Why kernel Edge enhance turn image Convolution matrix mean change image treat pixel
For pixel without surrounding pixel different way treat dependently result expect
You ignore get smaller image
Put arbitrary value surrounding
Or consider surrounding symmetrical image
Since matrix apply image mater apply bottom left right whatever
Each pixel result computed local result convolution image
For example image pmatrix b c e f g j k n p pmatrix If discard surrounding pixel result convolution matrix pmatrix pmatrix So convolution pixel j defined j
So convolution stress difference pixel hence show edge
I hope clear

The term pixel actually short Picture Element
These small little dot make image computer display whether LCD tube CRT monitor
The screen divided matrix thousand even million pixel
Typically see individual pixel small
This good thing people prefer look smooth clear image rather blocky pixelated one
However set monitor low resolution look closely screen may able see individual pixel
As may guessed resolution comprised matrix pixel
That lot little dot
Each pixel one color time
However since small pixel often blend together form various shade blend color
The number color pixel determined number bit used represent
For example color allows color displayed
At color depth may able see graininess spotted color one color blend another
However color depth color blending smooth unless kind vision capability see graininess

In physical point smallest addressable element smallest controllable element picture represented screen
Each pixel original image sample typically provide accurate representation original
The pixel variable
In color imaging system color typically represented three four component intensity
In context description refers single scalar element representation precisely called camera sensor context although neologism sometimes used describe element digital camera sensor yet context may refer set component intensity spatial position
Drawing distinction pixel photosites sample may reduce confusion describing color system use camera use produce color component via upsampling
The word picture shortened pic element similar formation include word
The word pixel first published describe picture element Moon Mars
Billingsley learned word Keith McFarland Link Division General Precision turn said know originated
McFarland said simply use time circa
The word combination picture
The word appeared magazine headline abbreviation word reference movie
By pix used reference still picture photojournalist
The concept picture element date earliest day television example German word literally point German patent
According various etymology earliest publication term magazine though used earlier various patent filed early
Some author explain early
In graphic image video processing often used instead
For example IBM used Technical Reference
Pixels abbreviated also unit measurement commonly used graphic web design equivalent roughly inch mm
This measurement used make sure given element display size matter screen resolution view
spelled second unrelated filmmaking technique date beginning cinema live actor posed frame frame photographed create animation
An archaic British word meaning possession spirit term used describe animation process since early various animator including credited popularizing
thought smallest single component digital image
However definition highly
For example page pixel carried electronic signal represented digital value pixel display device pixel photosensor element
This list exhaustive depending context synonym include pel sample byte bit dot spot
used unit measure pixel per inch pixel per line spaced pixel apart
The measure dpi ppi sometimes used interchangeably distinct meaning especially printer device dpi measure printer density dot
ink droplet placement
For example photographic image may printed ppi dpi inkjet printer
Even higher dpi number dpi quoted printer manufacturer since mean much term achievable
The pixel used represent image closer result resemble original
The number pixel image sometimes called resolution though resolution specific definition
Pixel count expressed single number digital camera nominal three million pixel pair number display pixel side side top bottom display therefore total number pixel megapixels
The pixel color sample form digitized image file used web page may may screen pixel depending computer display image
In computing image composed pixel known
The word originates pattern widely used describe similar printing storage technique
For convenience pixel normally arranged
By using arrangement many common operation implemented uniformly applying operation pixel independently
Other arrangement pixel possible sampling pattern even changing shape pixel across image
For reason care must taken acquiring image one device displaying another converting image data one pixel format another
For example Computers use pixel display image often abstract image represents
The resolution image called display resolution determined computer
monitor also use pixel display image
Each pixel made number triad determining native resolution
On monitor beam sweep rate may fixed resulting fixed native resolution
Most CRT monitor fixed beam sweep rate meaning native resolution instead set resolution equally well supported
To produce sharpest image possible LCD user must ensure display resolution computer match native resolution monitor
The pixel scale used astronomy angular distance two object sky fall one pixel apart detector CCD infrared chip
The scale measured ratio pixel spacing preceding optic
The focal length product diameter associated lens mirror
Because usually expressed unit per pixel radian equal arcsecond diameter often given millimeter pixel size micrometer yield another factor formula often quoted
The number distinct color represented pixel depends number bit per pixel bpp
A bpp image us pixel pixel either
Each additional bit double number color available bpp image color bpp image color For color depth bit per pixel depth normally sum bit allocated red green blue component
usually meaning bpp normally five bit red blue six bit green human eye sensitive error green two primary color
For application involving transparency bit may divided five bit red green blue one bit left transparency
A depth allows bit per component
On system depth available mean pixel extra bit describe purpose combining another image
Many display system various reason capable displaying sensing different site
Therefore pixel grid divided region contribute displayed sensed color viewed distance
In display LCD LED plasma display region separately addressable element come known
For example typically divide pixel vertically three subpixels
When square pixel divided three subpixels subpixel necessarily rectangular
In display industry terminology subpixels often referred basic addressable element viewpoint hardware hence rather used
Most digital camera use sensor region example using pattern camera industry known like display industry
For system subpixels two different approach taken This latter approach referred us knowledge manipulate three colored subpixels separately producing increase apparent resolution color display
While display use phosphor area dictated mesh grid called shadow mask would require difficult calibration step aligned displayed pixel raster CRTs currently use subpixel rendering
The concept subpixels related
A megapixel MP million pixel term used number pixel image also express number element number display element
For example camera make pixel image finished image pixel typically us extra row column sensor element commonly said megapixels megapixels depending whether number reported effective total pixel count
Digital camera use photosensitive electronics either CCD CMOS image sensor consisting large number single sensor element record measured intensity level
In digital camera sensor array covered patterned color filter mosaic red green blue region arrangement sensor element record intensity single primary color light
The camera interpolates color information neighboring sensor element process called create final image
These sensor element often called pixel even though record channel red green blue final color image
Thus two three color channel sensor must interpolated camera produce image provides information image size could get scanner
Thus certain color contrast may look fuzzier others depending allocation primary color green twice many element red blue Bayer arrangement
invented measure sharpness camera produce paired particular lens opposed MP manufacturer state camera product based camera sensor
The new claim accurate relevant value photographer consider camera sharpness
As mounted highest measured
However value MP still MP sensor
A camera image sensor camera image sensor may pixel count example MP camera may allow better dynamic range le noise improved shooting performance camera
This camera larger image sensor camera therefore information captured per pixel
A camera shoot photograph megapixels roughly pixel size camera shoot megapixels
One new method add Megapixels introduced camera us sensor produce RAW JPEG making two exposure shifting sensor half pixel
Using tripod take level within instance multiple image generated unified image

Short pixel single point graphic image
Graphics monitor display picture dividing thousand million pixel arranged row
The pixel close together appear connected
The number used represent pixel determines many color shade gray displayed
For example color mode us bit pixel making possible display power different color shade gray
On color monitor pixel actually composed three red blue green one
Ideally three dot converge point error make color pixel appear fuzzy
The quality display system largely depends many pixel display many bit used represent pixel

A bid given owner construction manager willing complete construction project
A bid tell owner much money expect pay construction management company order complete project
The design stage involves four step programming feasibility schematic design design development contract document

This done general contractor company construction work
If contractor work obtain subcontractor
Subcontractors contractor specialize one particular aspect construction work concrete welding glass carpentry

Construction Management education come variety format formal degree program degree continuing education professional development
Information degree program available American Council Construction Education ACCE Construction Management Association America CMAA Associated Schools Construction ASC
According American Council Construction Education one academic accreditation agency responsible accrediting construction management program academic field construction management encompasses wide range topic
These range general management skill management skill specifically related construction technical knowledge construction method practice
There many school offering Construction Management program including offering master degree
Capital project management software CPMS refers system currently available help capital project program manager construction manager control manage vast amount information capital construction project create
A collection portfolio project make bigger challenge
These system go different name capital project management software computer construction software construction management software project management information system

Among main construction management software mentioned
The construction industry typically includes three party owner licensed designer builder usually known
There traditionally two contract party work together plan design construct project
The first contract contract involves planning design construction contract administration
The second contract contract involves construction
An indirect relationship exists designer contractor due two contract
An owner may also contract construction project management company adviser creating third contract relationship project
The construction manager role provide construction advice designer design advice constructor owner behalf advice necessary
The phrase design bid build describes prevailing model construction management general contractor engaged tender process design completed architect engineer
Many owner particularly government agency let contract known
In type contract construction team known responsible taking owner concept completing detailed design following owner approval design proceeding construction
technology may used contractor maintain tight construction time
There three main advantage contract
First construction team motivated work architect develop practical design
The team find creative way reduce construction cost without reducing function final product
The second major advantage involves schedule
Many project commissioned within tight time frame
Under traditional contract construction begin design finished project awarded bidder
In contract contractor established outset construction activity proceed concurrently design
The third major advantage contractor incentive keep combined design construction cost within owner budget
If speed important design construction contract awarded separately bidding take place preliminary plan contract instead single firm contract
The major problem contract inherent conflict interest
In standard contract architect work owner directly responsible owner
In architect work owner therefor may make design construction decision benefit benefit owner
During construction architect normally act owner representative
This includes reviewing builder work ensuring product method meet specification code
The architect role compromised architect work owner directly
Thus owner may get building increase profit building built product maximize profit
methodology follows Construction cost management service construction manager CM responsible exclusively owner acting owner interest every stage project
The construction manager offer impartial advice matter Comprehensive management every stage project beginning original concept project definition yield greatest benefit owner
As time progress beyond phase CM ability effect cost saving diminishes
The agency CM represent owner helping select design construction team managing design preventing helping owner stay within predetermined budget value engineering analysis comparison
The field developed apply information technology construction management
CM delivery method entail commitment construction manager deliver project within GMP
The construction manager act consultant owner development design phase preconstruction service general contractor construction
When construction manager bound GMP fundamental character relationship changed
In addition acting owner interest construction manager must control construction cost stay within GMP
CM global term referring business relationship construction contractor owner architect designer
Typically CM arrangement eliminates construction project
A GMP agreement typical part agreement comparable contract adjustment responsibility CM
The advantage CM arrangement budget management
Before project design completed six eighteen month coordination designer owner CM involved estimating cost constructing project based goal designer owner design concept project scope
In balancing cost schedule quality scope project design may modified instead redesigned owner decides expand project adjustment made pricing
To manage budget design complete construction crew mobilized CM conduct site management purchase major item efficiently manage time cost
An delivery method best large complete construction easy define possibility changing scope strict schedule deadline
Additionally efficient method project containing technical complexity coordination multiple phase
Starting Accelerated Bridge Program late began employing accelerated construction technique sign contract incentive early completion penalty late completion us intense construction longer period complete closure shorten overall project duration reduce cost

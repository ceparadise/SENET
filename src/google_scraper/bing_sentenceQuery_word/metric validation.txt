Page Validation verification two way check data entered computer correct
entered incorrectly little use
automatic computer check ensure data entered sensible reasonable
It check accuracy data

The computer programmed accept number
This check
However guarantee number typed correct
For example student age might entered valid incorrect
There number validation type used check data entered

I edit enable logging using validation monitor But confused set program
I learned used flowwing way So use
I think easy way since part
contribution code supported TensorFlow team
So unless using API like might able simply pas instance optimizer method

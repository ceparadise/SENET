Computer programmer often work developer number different area capacity
These range area far programmer web developer area least database administrator
Other area include descending order student web developer mobile developer desktop developer web developer embedded app developer enterprise level developer executive cio cto etc system administrator
The projected period growth marked future computer programming software period
It expected period growth computer occupation namely software development computer programmer take place total rate
Software developer expected move approximately developer
Similarly computer programmer expected increase number approximately
Open source one used platform programming developmental technology today trajectory likely continue upward
Since point shift company creating software client using open source moving company
It surprising therefore expected company developer expected increase contribution open source project within next year
In addition growth open source project software developed also emergence new improved powerful programming language
Apple Swift successor likely take front row center next year already risen Redmonk language ranking
Google Galang open source cloud development language also expected increase popularity usage move forward
Importantly new drag n drop technology also available programmer
Thanks language like MIT Scratch Code Studio Google Blockly programmer able build code project without heavily relying code
They build program simply dragging dropping block
This development currently emerging likely developed perfected next year
Finally responsive design challenge programmer likely continue meet head

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

Across many field concerned including little agreement meaning term although related computer machine
Multiple view interactivity exist
In contingency view interactivity three level One body research made strong distinction interaction interactivity
As suffix used form noun denote quality condition body research defined interactivity condition interaction
These researcher suggest distinction interaction interactivity important since interaction may present given setting quality interaction varies low high
Human communication basic example involves two different process human human interactivity human computer interactivity
interactivity communication people
On hand human computer communication way people communicate
According Rada Roy model might consists main component consist HUMAN COMPUTER TASK ENVIRONMENT MACHINE ENVIRONMENT
The two basic flow information control assumed
The communication people computer one must understand something task people perform computer
A general model human computer interface emphasizes flow information control human computer interface
Human Human interactivity consists many conceptualization based anthropomorphic definition
For example complex system detect react human behavior sometimes called interactive
Under perspective interaction includes response human physical manipulation like movement body language change
Media theorist Fernando Arturo Torres defined interactivity particular medium ability facilitate property necessary ideal conversation Towards A Universal Theory Of Media Interactivity Developing A Proper Context Definition Interactivity para

His research determined interactivity defined well medium facilitates communication rather technology medium
In context communication human interactivity refers artifact interactive behaviour experienced human user
This different aspect artifact visual appearance internal working meaning sign might mediate
For example interactivity physical shape colour ability play music storage behaviour experienced user
This includes way user move finger input wheel way allows selection tune playlist way user control volume
An artifact interactivity best perceived use
A bystander imagine would like use artifact watching others use actual use interactivity fully experienced felt
This due nature interactive experience
It similar difference watching someone drive car actually driving
It driving one experience feel car differs others
New Media academic Vincent Maher defines interactivity relation constituted symbolic interface referential objective functionality subject
The term often used refer specific computer system
Using look refers visual design feel refers interactivity
Indirectly regarded informal definition interactivity
For detailed discussion interactivity conceptualized interaction literature French philosopher shed light user experience see Svanaes
In interactive refers software accepts responds input example data command
Interactive software includes popular program
By comparison program operate without human contact example include application
If response complex enough said system conducting social interaction system try achieve implementation
Also notion kind user interaction like

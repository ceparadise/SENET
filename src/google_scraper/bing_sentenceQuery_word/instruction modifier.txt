In single operation defined processor
The size length instruction varies widely little many multiple VLIW system
Most modern processor used instruction size bit
In architecture especially instruction fixed length typically corresponding architecture
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifying operation performed add content memory register zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous operation operand specified single instruction
Instructions rarely specified using form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
There another general definition instruction related processor An instruction may representation element executable

All computer software built set instruction
Instructions encoded binary
The cycle sequence step CPU follows process instruction
Software program set instruction
For execute instruction one must first translated simple code activate part CPU
The CPU performs basic function A piece software game combine function perform complex task

There two type English language
They distinctly different role examine turn
First let look definition word
An describes modifies noun person place thing idea
Adjectives may single word may whole phrase
The different adjective primarily modifies verb may also modify adjective adverb
Again adverb may single word whole phrase
Let look example
Adjectives necessary writing like much salt use many adjective produce negative result
Here question adjective answer For instance let look phrase dog
If I answer question dog one sentence might read saw one enormous brown angry old collie cross street
As see answering every question adjective sentence always recipe good sentence get idea
The helpful
You tell using adjective phrase word point back noun sentence
For instance let look sentence mother cook
Adding adjective clarify many helpful detail mother
For instance better sentence might read gracious mother Italian cook spaghetti could make angel swoon
The word serf single adjective
The phrase Italian describes noun phrase could make angel swoon modifies noun
It worth mentioning using many adjective make writing seem laborious silly
For instance read following sentence
Caffey ate ripe red delicious sweet succulent fabulous terrific outstanding strawberry
You get point
Instead modifying noun adverb describe verb
This easy remember adverb information
Adverbs answer following question Let start basic sentence monkey crossed road
The word verb action word focus add adverb sentence
If answer four question sentence remember definitely necessary order write excellent sentence sentence might look like three monkey quickly crossed road fast food restaurant wanted buy banana milkshake
To answer question chose three
fast food restaurant answer
wanted buy banana milkshake answer question word let u know
We see using adverb greatly improve writing providing reader additional often interesting information
In addition modifying verb adverb may modify adjective adverb
Let look two example Get FREE access day create account
Unfortunately modifier placed wrong section sentence meaning thrown
For instance take sentence Brown ate bread
If one say
Brown ate old bread meaning sentence changed completely
As another example street Cassie thought water might cause flood
We could ask whether Cassie water running street
The street make sentence confusing
It would read better said thought water running street might cause flood
The intended meaning much clearer
By placing modifier close possible word describing problem avoided
Adding writing one way make word interesting specific
type modifier
Without modifier writing would bland
Just remember use right amount
Too many modifier could produce opposite effect intend making writing sound exaggerated silly

Access modifier change visibility member class
For instance In case access modifier
C implement access modifier restrict access structs using incomplete type
This done registering type header file implementation code file
For example In header file In code file If someone includes able declare list variable pointer able access value
For instance Hence technique equivalent access modifier ALL element struct
Now want function equivalent private method use word code file declare header
Say want function private function public
Now header file And code file In case user could use struct pointer type could access variable
Also could call
Finally note static function externalized returning pointer could used implement friend behavior

Richard teach college writing master degree creative writing
Before jump subject lesson define key term
First thing first word phrase change modifies meaning another word phrase
It important note adjective adverb kind modifier
In fact modifier use adjective adverb
For example phrase house hill word hill modifies meaning house tell u house located
Next let talk
To put simply clause part sentence
Some sentence one clause walked park complex sentence contain multiple clause
For purpose lesson looking affect meaning whole sentence
An introductory clause clause lead u main clause
For example sentence eating breakfast I walked park clause eating breakfast introduces rest sentence giving u sense time
Now armed term let turn attention heart matter
A dangling modifier simply modifier clearly attached another part sentence hence word
Because dangling modifier muddle meaning sentence create situation sentence read several different meaning
With mind let look two somewhat silly example dangling modifier
Example Mouse Pajamas Consider following sentence Putting pajama mouse ran across floor
Try put scene sentence creates perhaps already similar experience
The speaker sentence putting pajama mouse run across floor
Simple enough right
However look closely clause sentence realize something amiss
The introductory clause pajama brings u scene also act modifier
Logically assume clause exists modify speaker sentence showing u speaker putting pajama action sentence occurs
However found main clause phrase pajama technically modifying subject main clause mouse
Therefore situation sentence pretty mouse putting speaker pajama
Common sense tell u interpret sentence one way meaning different read sentence literally
This excellent example ambiguity dangling modifier create
So resolve ambiguity
We rewrite sentence clear connection modifier intended subject sentence
This done least two way
The first method resolving dangling modifier make actual subject part introductory clause
Let see happens bring introductory clause example While I putting pajama mouse ran across floor
Obviously meaning sentence much clearer slightly different feel
This introductory clause become like clause stand
To put another way cut word clause would read complete sentence putting pajama
Now let move onto second way resolving dangling modifier involves adding information main clause sentence Putting pajama I saw mouse run across floor
This sentence feel much closer original example ambiguity found
This original modifier pajama changed
Rather made adjustment main clause sentence modifier made clearer
Of course method resolving dangling modifier work equally well
It matter close want feel revised sentence original
Example Clouds Street Get FREE access day create account
Now let put learned practice
Here another slightly surreal example Walking street cloud burst rain
Once considerable gap sentence mean actually say
Unless author sentence describing rain cloud walk street likely facing another dangling modifier street
So let try revising sentence using method learned previous section
Here first method adding introductory clause While Steve walking street cloud burst rain
Just previous example using method give introductory clause weight
In version sentence greater emphasis placed fact Steve walking street
What originally main clause cloud burst rain seems slightly le important rain simply something happening background
Now let see happens apply second method adding main clause Walking street Steve saw cloud burst rain
In version sentence leaf original modifier original main clause definitely carry emphasis
The nature sentence make u focus action saw cloud burst rain rather causing u focus fact Steve walking
Once one part sentence action fade slightly background
So difference emphasis
Technically speaking version sentence absolutely correct
Still revising dangling modifier important consider sentence
To put simply context refers information around sentence
For example author went describe Steve avoid rain first revision sentence Steve walking


would fit feel passage
On hand author launched detailed description rain looked like second revision saw cloud


would make sense
So deciding fix dangling modifier always look clue context surround sentence
If clue found simply choose whichever method feel right
Let review
A modifier word phrase change meaning modifies another word phrase
Because modifier often appear phrase appear main clause sentence commonly found part sentence
Dangling modifier clearly attached actual subject sentence resulting
Depending sentence fix dangling modifier adding information either introductory clause main clause

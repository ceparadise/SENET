In diagram meaning arrow
Here I think Each arrow describes change set flowing
So top workspace flow change accepts change stream
The bottom two workspace flow change stream thesis workspace accept change stream
Is correct
What meaning broken blue arrow
A broken arrow mean flow target currently
If open stream see section Flow Target list target
Each line two qualifier default current
Any target current represented broken arrow
Current mean requesting see difference one stream another display said difference stream target
See also oriented flow target repo workspace stream Here I think Each arrow describes change set flowing
Yes model wo directly change Stream
You always repo workspace
So top workspace flow change accepts change stream
Not exactly The bottom two workspace flow change stream thesis workspace accept change stream
Is correct
No target mean bottom repo workspace know Stream accept deliver change Stream flow target Pending change view actively monitor difference bottom repo workspace Stream
According link assertion Current mean flow target displayed Pending Changes view
Default mean try deliver flow target one marked get warning asking sure want deliver target
absolutely correct

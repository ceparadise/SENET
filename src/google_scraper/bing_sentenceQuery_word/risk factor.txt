In collectively name circumstance affecting likelihood impact
FAIR devoted analysis different factor influencing
It decompose various level starting first level Loss Event Frequency Probable Loss Magnitude going examining agent capability compared also called strength probability agent get contact actually act asset organization capability react event impact stakeholder
Risk factor factor influence frequency business impact risk scenario different nature classified two major category
An description IT related event lead business impact occur
Risk factor also interpreted causal factor scenario materialising weakness
These term often used risk management framework
characterized The risk scenario structure differentiates loss event event generating negative impact vulnerability vulnerability event event contributing magnitude frequency loss event occurring threat event circumstance event trigger loss event
It important confuse risk throw one large risk list

potential gaining losing something value
Values emotional financial wealth gained lost taking risk resulting given action inaction foreseen unforeseen planned planned
Risk also defined intentional interaction
Uncertainty potential unpredictable uncontrollable outcome risk consequence action taken spite uncertainty
subjective judgment people make severity probability risk may vary person person
Any human endeavour carry risk much riskier others
The cite earliest use word English spelling French original spelling
It defines Exposure possibility loss injury adverse unwelcome circumstance chance situation involving possibility
The publication ISO Guide definition risk uncertainty objective
In definition uncertainty include event may may happen uncertainty caused ambiguity lack information
It also includes negative positive impact objective
Many definition risk exist common usage however definition developed international committee representing country based input several thousand subject matter expert
Very different approach risk management taken different field
Risk unwanted subset set uncertain outcome Cornelius Keating
Risk ubiquitous area life risk management something must whether managing major organisation simply crossing road
When describing risk however convenient consider risk practitioner operate specific practice area
Economic risk manifested lower income higher expenditure expected
The cause many instance hike price raw material lapsing deadline construction new operating facility disruption production process emergence serious competitor market loss key personnel change political regime natural disaster
Risks personal health may reduced action decrease early cause illness action person clearly measured clinical sign symptom recognised risk factor
Tertiary reduces negative impact already established disease restoring function reducing complication
Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion individual patient obtain secondary tertiary prevention effort whereas public health effort primary prevention require education entire population risk
In case careful communication risk factor likely outcome must distinguish causal event must decreased associated event may merely consequence rather cause
In epidemiology effect also called entire lifetime
In term occupational health safety management term may defined likely consequence hazard combined likelihood probability occurring
Health safety environment HSE separate practice area however often linked
The reason typically organizational management structure however strong link among discipline
One strongest link single risk event may impact three area albeit differing timescales
For example uncontrolled release radiation toxic chemical may immediate safety consequence protracted health impact much environmental impact
Events Chernobyl example caused immediate death longer term death cancer left lasting environmental impact leading birth defect impact wildlife etc
Over time form risk analysis called environmental risk analysis developed
Environmental risk analysis field study attempt understand event activity bring risk human health environment
Human health environmental risk likelihood adverse outcome See
As risk function hazard exposure
Hazard intrinsic danger harm posed
toxicity chemical compound
Exposure likely contact hazard
Therefore risk even hazardous substance approach zero exposure nears zero given person organism biological makeup activity location See
Another example health risk certain behaviour increase likelihood contracting HIV
Individual risk perception risk taking also influenced social factor
A study using representative household data US Italy Austria find evidence risk taking level influenced immediate social environment welfare regime state
different support network
The study also find factor interact

Cass Sunstein hold risk social construe also correct diagnosis vital understand evolution
State appeal net expert avoid populism consists biased information respecting probability risk
risk related information technology
This relatively new term developed result increasing awareness information security simply one facet multitude risk relevant IT real world process support
The increasing dependency modern society information computer network private public sector including military led new term like
mean protecting information unauthorised access use disclosure disruption modification perusal inspection recording destruction
Information security grew practice procedure
Information security grown
practice managing risk related use processing storage transmission information data system process used purpose
While focused dominantly information digital form full range IA encompasses digital also analogue physical form
Information assurance interdisciplinary draw multiple field including accounting fraud examination addition computer science
So narrowly focused computer security extends risk related form information paper microfilm
risk include one related consistency business information stored IT system information stored mean relevant business consequence
Insurance risk treatment option involves risk sharing
It considered form contingent capital akin purchasing buyer pay small premium protected potential large loss
Insurance risk often taken insurance company bear pool risk including market risk credit risk operational risk interest rate risk mortality risk longevity risk etc
Means assessing risk vary widely profession
Indeed may define profession example doctor manages medical risk civil engineer manages risk structural failure
A professional usually focused risk assessment mitigation professional behalf client public society life general
In workplace incidental exist
Incidental risk occur naturally business part core business
Inherent risk negative effect operating profit business
The experience many people rely human service support often used reason prevent gaining independence fully accessing community service often unnecessarily risk averse
People autonomy used compromised institution wall often risk management practice according
Michael Fischer Ewan Ferlie find contradiction formal risk control role subjective factor human service role emotion ideology undermine service value producing tension even intractable conflict
A HRO organisation succeeded avoiding catastrophe environment expected due risk factor
Most study HROs involve area nuclear aircraft carrier air traffic control aerospace nuclear power station
Organizations share common ability consistently operate safely complex interconnected environment single failure one component could lead catastrophe
Essentially organisation appear operate spite enormous range risk
Some industry manage risk highly quantified enumerated way
These include possible failure complex series engineered system could result highly undesirable outcome
The usual measure risk class event probability event severity consequence
The total risk sum individual see
In nuclear industry consequence often measured term radiological release often banded five band
The risk evaluated using fault tree technique see
Where risk low normally considered broadly acceptable
A higher level risk typically time considered broadly acceptable justified cost reducing possible benefit make risk described Tolerable ALARP stand low reasonably practicable
Risks beyond level classified intolerable
The level risk deemed broadly acceptable considered regulatory body various early attempt UK government regulator academic used example similar activity definable risk people appear find acceptable
This resulted Farmer Curve acceptable probability event versus consequence
The technique whole usually referred probabilistic risk assessment PRA probabilistic safety assessment PSA
See example approach
In finance risk chance return achieved investment different expected also take account size difference
This includes possibility losing original investment
In view advocated Damodaran risk includes also upside risk return exceed expectation
Some regard historical return average return specific investment providing historical measure risk see modern portfolio theory
Financial risk may determined numerous market factor operational resulting fraudulent behaviour

A fundamental idea finance relationship risk return see
The greater potential return one might seek greater risk one generally assumes
A free market reflects principle pricing instrument strong demand safer instrument drive price higher return correspondingly lower weak demand riskier instrument drive price lower potential return thereby higher
For example US Treasury bond considered one safest investment
In comparison investment speculative grade corporate bond US Treasury note bond yield lower rate return
The reason corporation likely default debt US government
Because risk investing corporate bond higher investor offered correspondingly higher rate return
A popular VaR
There different type VaR long term VaR marginal VaR factor VaR shock VaR
The latter used measuring risk extreme market stress condition
In finance single definition
Artzner et al
write call risk investor future net worth
In Novak risk possibility undesirable event
In financial market one may need measure information timing source risk probability model risk operational risk regulatory civil action taken result
With advent automation financial market concept risk gained lot attention
Aldridge Krawciw define risk probability instantaneous loss due flash crash market crisis malicious activity selected market participant event
A example risk US million loss incurred within minute Knight Capital Group KCG August culprit runaway algorithm deployed firm
Regulators taken notice risk well
Basel III requires risk management framework bank stability
It always obvious financial instrument specifically reduce cancel risk another investment speculation increasing measurable risk exposing investor catastrophic loss pursuit high windfall increase expected value
Some people may

The express risk providing inappropriate opinion material misstatement commercial entity financial statement
It analytically expressed AR IR CR DR
Note As defined audit risk consider impact auditor misstatement stated simple probability
The impact misstatement must considered determining acceptable audit risk
Security risk management involves protection asset harm caused deliberate act
A detailed definition A security risk event could result compromise organizational asset
unauthorized use loss damage disclosure modification organizational asset profit personal interest political interest individual group entity constitutes compromise asset includes risk harm people
Compromise organizational asset may adversely affect enterprise business unit client
As consideration security risk vital component risk management
One growing area focus risk management field behavioural organizational psychology underpin understanding risk based decision making
This field considers question make risk based decision
irrationally scared shark terrorist motor vehicle medication
In regret anticipation regret play significant part distinct preferring status quo case one becomes worse
fundamental problem form risk assessment
In particular brain get overloaded take mental shortcut risk extreme event discounted probability low evaluate intuitively
As example one leading cause death caused partly given driver frame problem largely totally ignoring risk serious fatal accident
For instance extremely disturbing event attack hijacking may ignored analysis despite fact occurred nonzero probability
Or event everyone agrees inevitable may ruled analysis due greed unwillingness admit believed inevitable
These human tendency error often affect even rigorous application major concern
All must consider notational bias No group people assessing risk immune acceptance obviously wrong answer simply socially painful disagree
Framing involves information affect outcome risky decision
The right prefrontal cortex shown take global perspective greater left prefrontal activity relates local focal processing
From Theory Leaky Modules McElroy Seta proposed could predictably alter framing effect selective manipulation regional prefrontal activity finger tapping monaural listening
The result expected
Rightward tapping listening effect narrowing attention frame ignored
This practical way manipulating regional cortical activation affect risky decision especially directed tapping listening easily done
A growing area research examine various psychological aspect risk taking
Researchers typically run randomised experiment treatment control group ascertain effect different psychological factor may associated risk taking
Thus positive negative feedback past risk taking affect future risk taking
In experiment people led believe competent decision making saw opportunity risky choice took risk led believe competent saw threat took fewer risk
The concept maintenance advanced form
In case chemical industry apart probability failure consequence failure also important
Therefore selection maintenance policy based risk instead reliability
maintenance methodology act tool maintenance planning decision making reduce probability failure consequence
In maintenance decision making maintenance resource used optimally based risk class high medium low equipment machine achieve tolerable risk criterion
Closely related information assurance security risk cybersecurity application system security engineering order address compromise company required business mission purpose
In order address cybersecurity applies security supply chain design production environment product service product order provide efficient appropriate security commensurate value asset mission business process
Since risk assessment management essential security management tightly related
Security assessment methodology like contain risk assessment module important part first step methodology
On hand risk assessment methodology like evolved become security assessment methodology
An standard risk management Principles guideline implementation published code November
There many formal method used measure risk
Often probability negative event estimated using frequency past similar event
Probabilities rare failure may difficult estimate
This make risk assessment difficult hazardous industry example nuclear energy frequency failure rare harmful consequence failure severe
Statistical method may also require use turn may require calculation cost loss human life
This difficult problem
One approach ask people willing pay insure death radiological release
GBq answer depend strongly circumstance clear approach effective
Risk often measured undesirable outcome
This combine probability various possible event assessment corresponding harm single value

According one set definition fear fleeting emotion ascribed particular object trait fear referring trait anxiety distinct term anxiety generally used last longer attributed specific stimulus particular definition used author cited page
Some study show link anxious behaviour risk chance outcome unfavorable result
Joseph Forgas introduced based research emotion grouped either positive negative Lerner Keltner
Positive emotion happiness believed optimistic risk assessment negative emotion anger pessimistic risk assessment
As emotion negative valence fear therefore anxiety long associated negative risk perception
Under recent appraisal tendency framework Jennifer Lerner et refutes Forgas notion valence promotes idea specific emotion distinctive influence judgment fear still related pessimistic expectation
Psychologists demonstrated increase anxiety increase related people habituated anxiety experience awareness risk intensely normal individual
In anxiety promotes use bias quick thinking evaluate risk
This referred according Clore
However accuracy risk perception making choice known
Experimental study show brief surge anxiety correlated surge general risk perception
Anxiety exists presence threat perceived Maner Schmidt
As risk perception increase stay related particular source impacting mood change opposed spreading unrelated risk factor
This increased awareness threat significantly emphasised people conditioned anxiety
For example anxious individual predisposed generating reason negative result tend exhibit pessimism
Also finding suggest perception lack control lower inclination participate risky across various behavioural circumstance associated individual experiencing relatively high level trait anxiety
In previous instance supporting clinical research link emotional evaluation control anxiety felt option risk avoidance
There various view presented emotion cause people access involuntary response judgment making decision involve risk
Joshua Hemmerich et al
probe deeper anxiety impact choice exploring quick automatic natural reaction danger based emotion
This notion supported experiment engages physician simulated perilous surgical procedure
It demonstrated measurable amount participant anxiety patient outcome related previous experimentally created regret worry ultimately caused physician led feeling information guideline provided mock surgery
Additionally emotional level adjusted along simulated patient status suggest anxiety level respective decision made correlated type bad outcome experienced earlier part experiment
Similarly another view anxiety dispositional anxiety emotional state cognitive provide information future pitfall reward Maner Schmidt
When experiencing anxiety individual draw personal judgment referred pessimistic outcome appraisal
These emotion promote bias risk avoidance promote risk tolerance
It common people dread risk others They tend afraid epidemic disease nuclear power plant failure plane accident relatively unconcerned highly frequent deadly event traffic crash household accident medical error
One key distinction dreadful risk seems potential catastrophic consequence threatening kill large number people within short period time
For example immediately September attack many Americans afraid fly took car instead decision led significant increase number fatal crash time period following event compared time period attack
Different hypothesis proposed explain people fear dread risk
First psychometric paradigm suggests high lack control high catastrophic potential severe consequence account increased risk perception anxiety associated dread risk
Second people estimate frequency risk recalling instance occurrence social circle medium may overvalue relatively rare dramatic risk overpresence undervalue frequent le dramatic risk
Third according preparedness hypothesis people prone fear event particularly threatening survival human evolutionary history
Given human evolutionary history people lived relatively small group rarely exceeding people dread risk kill many people could potentially wipe one whole group
Indeed research found people fear peak risk killing around people increase larger group killed
Fourth fearing dread risk ecologically rational strategy
Besides killing large number people single point time dread risk reduce number child young adult would potentially produced offspring
Accordingly people concerned risk killing younger hence fertile group
The relationship higher level risk perception judgmental accuracy anxious individual remains unclear Joseph Constans
There chance judgmental accuracy correlated heightened anxiety
Constans conducted study examine worry propensity current mood trait anxiety might influence college student estimation performance upcoming exam study found worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias error risk assessment even variance attributable current mood trait anxiety removed
Another experiment suggests trait anxiety associated pessimistic risk appraisal heightened perception probability degree suffering associated negative experience controlling depression
In seminal work established distinction risk uncertainty

Uncertainty must taken sense radically distinct familiar notion Risk never properly separated
The term risk loosely used everyday speech economic discussion really cover two thing functionally least causal relation phenomenon economic organization categorically different

The essential fact risk mean case quantity susceptible measurement time something distinctly character crucial difference bearing phenomenon depending two really present operating

It appear measurable uncertainty risk proper shall use term far different unmeasurable one effect uncertainty
We accordingly restrict term uncertainty case type
Thus immeasurable possible calculate Knightian sense risk measurable
Another distinction risk uncertainty proposed Douglas Hubbard In sense one may uncertainty without risk risk without uncertainty
We uncertain winner contest unless personal stake risk
If bet money outcome contest risk
In case one outcome
The measure uncertainty refers probability assigned outcome measure risk requires probability outcome loss quantified outcome
The term often used similarly describe organisation individual attitude towards
One attitude may described
Risk tolerance look deviation expected
Risk appetite look much risk one willing accept
There still deviation within risk appetite
For example recent research find insured individual significantly likely divest risky asset holding response decline health controlling variable income age medical expense
Gambling investment wherein money hand risked possible large return possibility losing
Purchasing lottery ticket risky investment high chance return small chance high return
In contrast putting money bank defined rate interest action give guaranteed return small gain precludes investment possibly higher gain
The possibility getting return investment also known
Hubbard also argues defining risk product impact probability presumes unrealistically
A person utility proportional payoff
For example person would consider chance winning million exactly desirable getting certain
However actually would consider equivalent choice
This gave rise
Hubbard proposes instead describe risk quantity distinguishes probability magnitude risk
Risks simply described set function possible payoff gain loss associated probability
This array collapsed scalar value according

pm November December January December January Ergonomic risk factor aspect job task impose biomechanical stress worker
Ergonomic risk factor synergistic element MSD hazard
In Health Effects section preamble section V OSHA discus large body evidence supporting finding exposure ergonomic risk factor workplace cause contribute risk developing MSD
This evidence includes thousand epidemiological study laboratory study extensive review existing scientific evidence NIOSH National Academy Science show following ergonomic risk factor likely cause contribute MSD Of risk factor evidence Health Effects chapter show force forceful exertion repetition awkward posture especially occurring high level combination often associated occurrence MSDs
Exposure one ergonomic risk factor may enough cause contribute covered MSD
For example job task may require exertion much physical force even though task involve additional risk factor awkward posture repetition MSD likely occur
For example using hand knee hammer operating punch press using knee stretch carpet installation alone may expose employee degree physical stress employee significant risk harmed
However often ergonomic risk factor act combination create hazard
The evidence Health Effects section show job multiple risk factor greater likelihood causing MSD depending duration frequency magnitude exposure
Thus important ergonomic risk factor considered light combined effect causing contributing MSD
This achieved job hazard analysis control process includes identification ergonomic risk factor may present job
If identified employer information needed determine cause covered MSD understand risk factor need reduced eliminate materially reduce MSD hazard
Although certain risk factor described easy identify difficult understand may likely create hazardous exposure others apparent observable
Employers already ergonomics program person manage ergonomics program difficulty identifying risk factor workplace
Because person training experience ergonomic risk factor likely familiar concept
Through process developing implementing ergonomics program person gained good working knowledge ergonomic risk factor likely present workplace
For employer beginning program little training experience dealing ergonomic risk factor OSHA tried make process identifying workable possible
Therefore proposed rule OSHA taken ergonomic risk factor combination risk factor associated occurrence MSDs tried present way limited knowledge ergonomics readily identify
In way ergonomic risk factor proposed rule cover presented term specific physically observable work activity condition
If activity condition present table c tell employer risk factor likely relevant
OSHA proposing employer use list physical work activity condition starting point hazard evaluation several reason
First list activity condition easy employer understand able translate workplace readily would case ergonomic risk factor
For example hand used hammer easily understood term contact stress long reach graphically explains awkward posture may problem
Second list help employer quickly focus aspect job likely associated covered MSDs
At time list also identifies risk factor likely associated activity condition help employer focus analysis
In way list serf bridge combination risk factor study shown associated increased risk developing MSDs
Third employer start MSD identification evaluation process list ensures analysis comprehensive
This list includes major component work associated MSDs
The physical work activity condition OSHA included proposed rule cover basic physical aspect job workstation
These aspect include The following table show physical work activity workplace condition associated physical aspect Employers examine job covered MSD occurred identify physical work activity workplace condition evaluate risk factor OSHA identified potentially relevant considered compliance hazard analysis requirement proposed rule
It difficult understand job require employee apply lot physical effort may involve significant exposure ergonomic risk factor pose increased risk injury
For example easy see much biomechanical stress employee see grimace trying loosen lug nut old tire shift body weight stance wrench open stuck valve stiffen body order lift heavy bulky object floor truck
Simply put forceful exertion like take person task require much physical effort
An easy way confirm whether task involves forceful exertion ask worker task try
Performing forceful exertion requires application considerable contraction force muscle cause fatigue rapidly
The force must applied exertion quickly muscle fatigue become strained
Excessive prolonged exposure forceful exertion also lead overuse muscle may result muscle strain soreness damage
Performing forceful exertion also irritate tendon joint disc lead inflammation fluid build constriction blood vessel nerve area
Increased compression nerve pressure imposed inflamed tendon muscle contraction may cause disorder nervous system carpal tunnel syndrome nerve entrapment disorder
Injuries related forceful exertion occur tissue joint
As mentioned back injury overexertion leading cause workplace injury worker compensation case
A number study also show repeated forceful exertion hand arm associated MSDs using tool pinching pushing finger
Lifting carrying heavy object usually task come mind example forceful lifting task high force also involved type job
These include job require employee apply pinch force finger picking placing small item assembly line finger static force applying lot physical effort put last turn screw pulling hard wrench loosen bolt dynamic force tossing object container
Forceful carrying discussed Manual Handling activity condition
Many job involve repetition job apparent even upon cursory observation assembly line job motion repeated every second data processing job directory assistant operator court reporting letter package sorting
Repetitive motion job include performance identical motion also include repeating multiple task motion task similar involve muscle tissue
Evidence Health Effects section show strong association occurrence MSDs job involving exposure repetitive motion
The joint susceptible repetitive motion injury especially wrist finger shoulder elbow
Repetitive work done foot operating foot activated control knee climbing ladder using carpet kicker may also result MSD
Jobs provide short pause break motion task cycle often problem may adequate time muscle recover effect exertion motion must repeated
If pause motion pause short muscle recover rested condition
Thus effect force muscle accumulates muscle become fatigued strained
The lack adequate recovery time often occurs job involving highly repetitive task
This happens task cycle length short also mean job involves high number cycle repetition per minute
For example research show tendon muscle wrist may able recover repeated task cycle le second length repeated time per minute Ex

Jobs involving constant muscle activity static contraction also may provide adequate recovery time
These type job may involve continuously holding hand tool knife paint brush staple gun mean employee constant exposure static posture low contraction force
The longer motion job task performed le likely adequate recovery time
The accumulation exposure lead muscle fatigue overuse
In addition intensity exposure greater example repetitive motion job involve exposure additional risk factor force awkward posture static posture increased force required exertion also increase amount recovery time needed
Any part musculoskeletal system involved moving body subject injury inadequate recovery time recovery time needed vary body part
For example although employee may high risk forearm injury task cycle second long repeated time per minute may high risk shoulder injury regimen
The presence risk factor job particularly job involving repetitive motion forceful exertion increase force already required perform job task therefore increase amount time muscle need recover exertion task requires
If recovery time adequate presence risk factor hastens onset fatigue effect associated overuse muscle joint tendon
Many job task involve long reach working overhead putting item high shelf reaching across conveyor put part grasp object bending reach part bottom big supply box
These task expose employee extreme awkward posture
Where long reach momentary infrequent force low task problem likely adequate time body recover reach
However long reach done frequently force involved long reach last second risk harm increase
Long reach usually greatest impact shoulder lower back
The shoulder unique wide range motion compared joint body
The bony restraint minimal soft tissue constrains motion
Thus injury usually occur soft tissue used maintain awkward posture forceful exertion
The back flexed forward extended back extend reach beyond limit arm length
In addition worker repetitive job often bend back reduce awkward shoulder posture
Bending back forward add weight upper body force exerted back muscle supported spine
Bending side backwards twisting put spine back muscle awkward posture
Working surface high low another way employee exposed awkward posture
Where employee must work surface long period risk tissue damage MSD problem increase
Working surface high low many employee working surface adjustable
For example inch typical height desk table working surface operated sitting position inch typical height range working surface operated standing position
Although employee average height may able work comfortably working surface typical height may work shorter taller employee
An employee may bend significantly assemble part conveyor inch high employee working conveyor may work elbow away body
The height working surface also high low employee must use work surface workstation designed task performed
For example typical desk inch high designed computer use
Even person average height may raise elbow shoulder use keyboard desk
This especially true desk chair raised high enough correct problem
Even employee raised good height foot often left dangling floor
The chief complaint people usually make worked long time position feel stiff sore tired
These effect result task involve static posture driving several hour without break
Static posture increase amount force required task addition force required perform task contraction force must applied hold body position throughout work shift
Maintaining position posture includes variety thing
It includes holding arm shoulder posture without moving
The effect maintaining work position occur almost joint body vary depending body location
For example effect knee back squatting kneeling hour likely greater effect neck shoulder looking monitor period
Sitting long period without opportunity stand move around another way employee exposed static loading tissue primarily lumbar area back
It also affect upper back neck leg
The problem exacerbated awkward posture also present
Static posture
Employees may exposed static posture must sit prolonged period chair stool bench provide adequate lumbar support either back rest seat provide good lumbar support back rest
When lumbar support back bent forward muscle back trying force lumbar region natural curve proper alignment vertebra place pressure disc reduces blood supply spinal tissue
The constant exertion contraction force lead muscle fatigue
When back muscle become sore people tend slouch
In posture force placed back disc
As static loading continues pressure continues applied membrane disc may become stressed
Stressed disc turn may put pressure blood vessel may pinch nerve sciatic nerve result pain
Even chair back rest lumbar support help maintain back neutral position employee still may continue exposed static loading take advantage back rest
This may occur seat pan big seat high employee
Many employee respond sitting forward instead back rest foot ground thus pressing spine natural curve placing pressure disc
Using hand power tool perform physical work activity mean employee exposed ergonomic risk factor put risk injury
Rather shorthand way alerting employer aspect tool design use need checked see whether ergonomic risk factor may present
These include Sometimes referred worker act human clamp human vise
In situation worker usually hold object worked one hand often awkward forceful posture force applied hand
The hand used clamp hold object resisting force applied hand
Using hand clamp lead muscle fatigue inflammation muscle tendon
The strain muscle tendon clamping hand especially high task involves static posture contact stress
Although hand arm often used clamp larger job require foot leg hip torso lateral bending back support part work performed
For many job necessary appropriate worker wear glove job
Gloves make grasping object difficult changing friction decreasing dexterity interfering sensory feedback
This often lead using muscle force would required without glove
Additionally glove fold wrinkle bunch pressure point created result contact stress
Gloves fit le bulky may help relieve problem
An even better solution eliminate need wear glove
Examples glove use may rise level hazard providing inappropriate glove work failing consider worker need glove purchased providing thick glove task requires dexterity beyond allowed glove providing vibration dampening glove expecting level dexterity force exertion beyond level possible glove
Forceful manual handling activity leading cause workplace injury illness
Lower back MSDs lifting account large percentage worker compensation case
Studies discussed Health Effects section indicate employee performing manual handling task significantly higher risk back injury exposed force repetition awkward posture job
The physical work activity condition included manual handling list proposal one likely significant problem one major ergonomic risk factor associated manual handling task present force awkward posture
This discussion physical work activity condition manual handling task organized task lifting pulling
Manual handling task discussed physical work activity condition ergonomic risk factor likely significant problem
Workers lift lower move item every day
The heavier weight lifted lowered moved force worker exert
The heavier weight closer contraction required muscle maximum capability
When muscle contract near maximum fatigue rapidly likelihood damage muscle tissue involved activity increase
In situation involving lifting lowering moving heavy object people predominant risk factor force
Manual handling heavy object expose employee high force usually greatest impact back
Another aspect weight considered sudden shift weight
Workers often able accomplish manual handling task without injury prepared
When patient leg suddenly buckle transferred load within package container shift worker may physically mentally prepared weight
In lifting lowering force risk factor often need addressed
Although may perception lifting problematic lowering require worker exert force commensurate weight object
The actual force exerted worker determined weight object
It obvious lifting container weighing pound considerably easier weighing pound people capable lifting smaller amount
Posture play major role force required moving object
If object held lifted closer body muscle force required back le
Bulky container present problem lifted characteristic including weight compact
Finally frequency object lifted lowered time must supported may important determining risk presented job
When pushing pulling object weight object conveyance including content affect force required worker
Often worker slide object table flat surface
In case weight friction characteristic object surface prime determinant force required
Secondarily posture reach may affect degree risk presented job
Where conveyance cart used force required generally determined characteristic weight cart content
For heavy cart stopping controlling cart sometimes difficult important pushing pulling desired location
For carrying weight distance object characteristic affect force required
Often force exerted statically period time carrying
Additionally worker body motion stability biomechanics activity may much worse simple lifting lowering situation
Examples might carrying heavy part one work area another carrying container production pallet storage area carrying package delivering customer
Workers carrying greatly affected distance hand body activity
The force required manually move object muscle back shoulder increased significantly load moved away body
The resulting compression bone cushioning tissue also significantly increased
The impact musculoskeletal system increase dramatically object weight center gravity bulky object farther body
When moving object people distance away worker body affect force lift carry
Two characteristic lift requiring long horizontal reach make harder worker
The first worker body weight must supported lifted addition weight object
The second torque required put muscle greater mechanical disadvantage object lifted greater distance body joint involved
Because mechanical disadvantage predominant risk factor situation force increased risk factor awkward posture long reach present
The awkward posture involved long reach requires higher muscle force lift move weight would necessary reach shorter
The problem becomes worse either greater weight greater distance required
Lifting lowering carrying item long horizontal reach required usually greatest impact shoulder arm back
For lifting lowering horizontal reach long force factor need addressed
This usually accomplished reducing reach weight
Examples would include reaching product far side conveyor reaching part supply bin far edge work surface lifting large box center gravity distance body lifting lowering something far side barrier placing package far side pallet assisting patient sitting
For pushing pulling task may reach long however usually problem unless simultaneous lifting unless pushing pulling direction side side rather
Moving object side side much le efficient toward away body
There time worker carry object rested body arm position similar long reach
This also happens carrying large box container
When happens force risk factor probably important followed awkward static posture risk factor
Workers carrying must exert effort vertical position hand object started motion Snook Ex

The force required muscle back shoulder increased significantly hand near floor move shoulder
The NIOSH lift equation reduces recommended lift lift occurs shoulder level
In addition force resulting compression bone cushioning tissue increase likelihood injury
Ideally hand slightly waist level manual handling begin
Manual handling task require hand lower knee higher put worker biomechanical disadvantage requires muscle exert force starting point near waist height
Low starting point require bending squatting add stress back knee respectively due awkward posture
When lifted object worker knee must bend forward thus stretching muscle back awkward le efficient lifting posture
In addition stooped posture worker must lift weight torso object lifted
When object lifted height thrust lifting force shift muscle back smaller muscle shoulder
As load raised higher muscle shoulder become primary mover
When material lifted overhead control lift becomes important
If weight load suddenly shift lifted overhead resulting awkward posture combined weight distance load lower spine could tear tendon ligament muscle
In lifting lowering low high position awkward posture risk factor often need addressed
The awkward posture make muscle le efficient result higher muscle force would required lifting lowering took place load within inch waist
When pushing pulling object height hand affect amount force needed
When hand slightly waist height worker get muscle
As hand moved lower higher worker posture becomes awkward requires force muscle
Carrying object combine static loading muscle loading caused awkward vertical position load
The combination static awkward posture greatly increase fatigue muscle
Maintaining stooped posture carry load place strain muscle back shoulder well spinal disc
Not back supporting weight object also weight upper body
Carrying load shoulder height maintained prolonged period time shoulder muscle fatigue
The exception weight load rested skeletal system arm merely balance weight carrying object head carrying tray food shoulder
In producing product even service often necessary move object people
This may done worker pushing pulling carrying item
Almost invariably involves forceful exertion
The method movement force required distance moved important aspect job determine presence MSD hazard
The higher force required longer distance moved likely job present problem
Force predominant risk factor object moved mitigated using cart conveyance
This type job likely adverse affect back shoulder arm
Lifting lowering usually involved job type object carried
For lifting lowering part job discussion object people moved heavy consulted
The carry part task involves force static posture
The weight object distance affect force required time spent static forceful posture respectively
Carrying put body dynamic activity stability le body stationary
Examples movement distance might rise level hazard moving patient bed bath lifting tire floor head carrying heavy part pallet workstation
When pushing pulling object significant distance force required distance moved important aspect job
If cart conveyance used force push pull almost always risk factor concern
Sometimes large heavy object moved sliding across floor
This usually involves high force better done way using cart powered mover
Once weight object distance must carried important factor
The effect worker reduced providing form conveyance
Bending twisting manual handling creates awkward posture change way force distributed spine
When spine natural position force directed along bony structure distributed tissue spine curve
However bending twisting redirects force placing compressive shear force disc

indicate combined bending twisting spine reduces tissue tolerance intervertebral disc predisposing rupture
When object lifted worker knee must bend forward thus stretching muscle back awkward le efficient lifting posture
In addition stooped posture worker must lift weight torso object lifted
Lifting stooped posture also creates situation worker accelerate torso lift
Marras Granata Ex
Ex
found increased velocity acceleration trunk lateral bending twisting result measurable increase compressive shear force experienced intervertebral disc
In lifting lowering awkward posture risk factor often need addressed
The awkward posture make muscle le efficient result higher force would required lift lower inch waist
Lack good hand hold good coupling hand object result higher grasp force higher force higher back force adoption awkward posture secure stable relationship load
The predominant risk factor involved force awkward posture usually affect back hand wrist finger
When lifting lowering item coupling poor worker adapt
Sometimes involves hand center gravity load considerable distance body increase force required back awkward posture
Sometimes hand bend around box corner resulting considerable force exerted awkward posture
Bulky load cause worker bend back
Open box poor coupling may picked pinch grip top box side result high force ineffective grip
Hand force tend higher pushing pulling bulky item poor coupling The problem carrying object poor coupling bulky similar involved lifting lowering
These problem exacerbated static loading required carrying distance
Surfaces level require worker compensate placing body awkward posture
When spine natural position force directed along bony structure distributed tissue spine curve
However awkward posture redirect force placing compressive shear force disc placing muscle le efficient position
In addition move object manually force exerted foot need resisted force push back floor
When floor slippery sloped worker must expend energy resisting natural tendency foot slip
If load shift worker uneven slippery sloped surface injury becomes likely
Poor floor condition affect footing ease movement cart
Force risk factor usually exacerbated poor floor surface back usual location MSDs brought problem floor surface
Lack good footing result added stress postural muscle tissue
In lifting lowering awkward posture risk factor often need addressed
The awkward posture make muscle le efficient result higher force
The higher force lead fatigue inflammation
Pushing pulling uneven slippery sloped surface result sudden increase force needed move stop object
The increase force alone tear muscle strain tendon enough cause injury
When increase force occurs body awkward posture due surface muscle tendon strain likely due inefficient position muscle
Carrying object walking uneven slippery sloped surface cause body continually shift accommodate changing working surface

In determination algorithm amount time storage resource necessary
Usually involves determining relates length algorithm input number step take number storage location us
An algorithm said efficient function value small
Since different input length may cause algorithm different behavior function describing performance usually actual performance determined input algorithm
The term analysis algorithm coined
Algorithm analysis important part broader provides theoretical estimate resource needed algorithm solves given
These estimate provide insight reasonable direction search
In theoretical analysis algorithm common estimate complexity asymptotic sense estimate complexity function arbitrarily large input
used end
For instance said run number step proportional logarithm length sorted list searched O log n colloquially
Usually estimate used different algorithm may differ efficiency
However efficiency two reasonable implementation given algorithm related constant multiplicative factor called
Exact asymptotic measure efficiency sometimes computed usually require certain assumption concerning particular implementation algorithm called
A model computation may defined term postulating certain operation executed unit time
For example sorted list apply binary search element guarantee lookup element list done unit time log time unit needed return answer
Time efficiency estimate depend define step
For analysis correspond usefully actual execution time time required perform step must guaranteed bounded constant
One must careful instance analysis count addition two number one step
This assumption may warranted certain context
For example number involved computation may arbitrarily large time required single addition longer assumed constant
Two cost model generally used The latter cumbersome use employed necessary example analysis algorithm like used
A key point often overlooked published lower bound problem often given model computation restricted set operation could use practice therefore algorithm faster would naively thought possible
analysis theoretical classification estimate anticipates increase usually denoted increase
efficiency topic great interest A take second hour even year finish executing depending algorithm implement
While technique used measure algorithm practice provide timing data infinitely many possible input latter achieved theoretical method analysis
Since algorithm
given algorithm implemented arbitrary arbitrary running arbitrary additional significant drawback using approach gauge comparative performance given set algorithm
Take example program look specific entry size
Suppose program implemented Computer A machine using algorithm Computer B much slower machine using
two computer running respective program might look something like following Based metric would easy jump conclusion running algorithm far superior efficiency
However size increased sufficient number conclusion dramatically demonstrated error Computer A running linear search program exhibit growth rate
The program directly proportional input size
Doubling input size double run time quadrupling input size quadruple forth
On hand Computer B running binary search program exhibit growth rate
Quadrupling input size increase run time amount example n
Even though Computer A ostensibly faster machine Computer B inevitably surpass Computer A running algorithm much slower growth rate
Informally algorithm said exhibit growth rate order beyond certain input size function time positive constant provides algorithm
In word given input size greater constant running time algorithm never larger
This concept frequently expressed using Big O notation
For example since input size increase insertion sort said order
Big O notation convenient way express given algorithm although also used express example scenario
Assuming execution time follows power rule coefficient found taking empirical measurement run time point calculating
In word measure slope empirical line execution time problem size size point
If order growth indeed follows power rule line plot indeed straight line empirical value stay constant different range change line curved line still could serve comparison two given algorithm behaviour
Applied table It clearly seen first algorithm exhibit linear order growth indeed following power rule
The empirical value second one diminishing rapidly suggesting follows another rule growth case much lower local order growth improving still empirically first one
The complexity scenario given algorithm sometimes evaluated examining structure algorithm making simplifying assumption
Consider following A given computer take execute involved carrying algorithm
The specific amount time carry given instruction vary depending instruction executed computer executing conventional computer amount
Say action carried step considered consume time step us time forth
In algorithm step run
For evaluation assumed step run well
Thus total amount time run step step The step trickier evaluate
The outer loop test step execute time note extra step required terminate loop hence n n execution consume time
The inner loop hand governed value j
On first pas outer loop j iterates The inner loop make one pas running inner loop body step consumes time inner loop test step consumes time
During next pas outer loop j iterates inner loop make two pass running inner loop body step consumes time inner loop test step consumes time
Altogether total time required run inner loop body expressed The total time required run outer loop test evaluated similarly factored Therefore total running time algorithm As one assume term given function dominates rate growth thus defines order
In example n term one conclude f n O n
Formally proven follows Prove Let constant greater equal Therefore A approach analyzing algorithm would declare equal one unit time system unit chosen one unit greater equal actual time step
This would mean algorithm running time break follows The methodology analysis also utilized predicting growth rate consumption
As example consider following pseudocode manages reallocates memory usage program based size program manages In instance file size n increase memory consumed rate order O
This extremely rapid likely unmanageable growth rate consumption memory
Algorithm analysis important practice accidental unintentional use inefficient algorithm significantly impact system performance
In application algorithm taking long run render result outdated useless
An inefficient algorithm also end requiring uneconomical amount computing power storage order run rendering practically useless
Analysis algorithm typically focus asymptotic performance particularly elementary level practical application constant factor important data practice always limited size
The limit typically size addressable memory machine GiB greater used machine EiB
Thus given limited size order growth time space replaced constant factor sense practical algorithm O large enough constant small enough data
This interpretation primarily useful function grow extremely slowly binary log le practical data bit binary log log le virtually practical data bit binary log log le virtually practical data bit
An algorithm complexity may nonetheless efficient algorithm constant complexity practical data overhead constant time algorithm result larger constant factor one may long
For large data linear quadratic factor ignored small data asymptotically inefficient algorithm may efficient
This particularly used like use asymptotically efficient algorithm time complexity switch asymptotically inefficient algorithm time complexity small data simpler algorithm faster small data

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
This question already answer I gone much deep CS
So please forgive question good scope site
I seen many site book notation like O n tell time taken algorithm
I read article I still able understand calculate given algorithm
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
This part computer science called analysis algorithm
Many time people satisfied given guarantee performance worse specified bound care exact performance
This bound conveniently denoted notation case O f n upper bound
That input size n algorithm complexity guaranteed exceed constant time f n
Most time clear context bound measured
Note measured actual time unit second minute etc
frowned upon compare meaningful across different computer
Typically elementary operation identified like compare exchange sorting algorithm push pop algorithm includes stack update tree data structure used algorithm
This elementary operation understood dominating one largest contribution complexity perhaps expensive another one particular setting multiplication considered expensive addition example
It selected cost operation proportional number elementary operation
This upper bound called complexity algorithm
Because hold input size n input incur highest worst cost
The actual performance specific input size n may lot lower upper bound
While possible exact analysis usually much involved arrive exact result
Also exact analysis mean accounting operation algorithm requires rather detailed implementation counting elementary operation done mere sketch algorithm time
It nice analysis possible always necessary
Because small input much problem want learn happens input size n get large
Knowing complexity bounded n nice looking performance asymptotically term dominates others large n
So proving upper bound O suffices
If two algorithm guarantee one performs like like n easily decide one lower us le elementary operation noting quadratic function grows faster linear function
In practice mean linear algorithm finish earlier process larger input time
But might constant hidden practical n algorithm faster
However three algorithm O guarantee complexity hard pressed decide algorithm choose
Then detailed bound needed perhaps even exact analysis
It may well analysis hard give bound
Then gap actual performance perhaps bound perhaps O
Then clever idea involved analysis necessary close gap provide improved bound
This improvement bound algorithm
Typically argue carefully want prove tighter bound
This said analysis algorithm simple looking implementation counting nesting depth loop conclude operation innermost loop executed O time say three loop nested
For type algorithm analysis follows always pattern theorem like tell generically algorithm performance
Then apply theorem get bound
Perhaps faced recursive algorithm able describe algorithm complexity recurrence relation
Then solving recurrence give desired bound
Typically exploit property input
Sorting algorithm deeply connected permutation knowing something number inversion permutation help lot analysing performance
There general approach proceed analysis
As discussed depends algorithm input implementation elementary operation choosen mathematical tool hand desired sharpness bound
Some may prefer treatment
Then different technique necessary
Big O notation O ignores constant factor left upper bound growth rate
For single line statement like assignment running time independent input size n time complexity would O For loop like The running time would O n line executed n time
But It O statement executed n time every
For statement depends condition statement executed
The running time logarithmic O n multiplication
For instance Which
Hence O n
For information look Wikipedia atricle A statement like Algorithm A take O n time
say much actual runtime algorithm given instance
You usually read like For fixed N n runtime A instance size n bounded function f n cn c R fixed
This called asymptotic runtime bounded O n much weaker statement
All item come sharper analysis even impossibly perform without knowledge concrete machine algorithm run
Aside determining c precisely deriving upper lower bound average case analysis amortised analysis smoothed analysis popular technique better describe algorithm behaviour
Note furthermore tha memory hierarchy usually ignored even though heavily influence performance
See answer quick explanation different Landau symbol
That said analysing algorithm conceptually simple Count executed operation sum relative runtimes
As often hard trick employed desired quality resulting bound inform one employ extent
Performing analysis
one yield exactly desired precision definitely art
If want see exceptionally rigorous analysis take peek Donald Knuth The Art Computer Programming
For example common resolution try Cormen Leiserson et al Introduction Algorithms
Let give graphical representation
Consider two function f n g n look something like When say function f n bound O g n
f n O g n actually mean exists constant c f n g n like figure Likewise say function f n bound g n
f n g n actually mean exists constant c f n g n like figure In manner say function f n bound g n
f n g n actually mean exists two constant SAME FUNCTION g n f n g n like figure NOTE You remember notation O write O always end finishing top line When write notation always finish bottom line function line middle
Now said basic understanding asymptotic notation look following figure
The following figure dice analysis runtime merge sort algorithm O denote sort expression constant factor stripped
The difference O notation set upper bound algorithm running time Omega notation set lower bound Theta notation sandwich algorithm running time
To calculate running time algorithm find dominates running time
For example designed algorithm binary search quick sort running time dominated quick sort
But finally calculate running time algorithm least partially consist algorithm seen
In case find part spends time
It usually mean look loop nested loop recursive call
There much say algorithm analysis also technique like amortized analysis
To find I highly recommend read Introduction Algorithms Third Edition CLRS

I heard thing like C Runtime Visual Runtime Common Language Runtime etc
When coding assembly language Linux I could use INT instruction make system call
So runtime nothing bunch function wrap low level function abstract high level function
But seem like definition library runtime
Are runtime two different thing
These day I thinking maybe something common called JVM
Here quotation lead thought This compilation process sufficiently complex broken several layer abstraction usually involve three translator compiler virtual machine implementation assembler
Introduction The Road Down To Hardware Land As per Wikipedia
In computer programming runtime library special program library used compiler implement function built programming language runtime execution computer program
This often includes function input output memory management
A system also called runtime system runtime software designed support execution computer program written computer language
The system contains implementation basic command may also implement command may support type checking debugging even code generation optimization
Some service system accessible programmer application programming interface service task scheduling resource management may inaccessible
runtime runtime library two different name thing
Runtime describes executed program running especially instruction write explicitly necessary proper execution code
language like C small runtime
More complex language like allows dynamic message passing much extensive runtime
You correct runtime code library code library code general term describing code produced library
Runtime code specifically code required implement feature language
Runtime general term refers library framework platform code run
The C runtimes collection function
The runtime contains interpreter garbage collector
The part language implementation executes code present part implementation called C standard
Java runtime consists virtual machine standard library common C runtime consists loader part operating system runtime library implement part C language built executable compiler hosted environment includes part standard library In understanding exactly mean time program run
You say something happens compile time
I think two separate thing
C runtime seem right
I call C runtime library
Answers question I think term extended include also environment context program run This answer extend opinion fact definition
Matt Ball answered correctly
I would say example
Consider running program compiled version year compiler let run version window like Win etc
Its bit compiler
And see program bit pointer
Why OS
Yeah
compiler setup execution environment bit bit version OS supported
What commonly called JRE Java Runtime Environment provides Java program resource may need execute
Actually runtime environment brain product idea Virtual Machines
A virtual machine implement raw interface hardware program may need execute
The runtime environment adopts interface present use programmer
A compiler developer would need facility provide execution environment program
Run time exactly code come life see lot important thing code
Runtime responsibility allocating memory freeing memory using operating system sub system like File Services IO Network Services etc
Your code called WORKING IN THEORY practically run code
Runtime friend help achiving
I found make insightful context understanding You see Development Kit eg
stuff get run runtime
It content like The zip contains So eg
C runtime would file like C runtime library run runtime made special content purpose inclusion definition C language implemented C implementation choice
And get runtime implementation use build upon
That little polarisation runnable file user new program need
As developer program need C compiler C library header user need
runtime could denote current phase program life runtime compile time load time link time could mean runtime library form basic low level action interface execution environment
could mean runtime system execution environment
case C program runtime code set stack heap etc
requirement expected C environment
essentially set environment promised language
could runtime library component something like case C Run time instance know type object creates execution object creation based certain condition computation work
In contradict compile time instance required object defined execution
These section MSDN documentation deal question I hope help
Thanks Damian Runtime somewhat opposite
Historically come slow mainframe environment expensive
Runtime period time program running
It begin program opened executed end program quit closed
Runtime technical term used often software development
It commonly seen context runtime error error occurs program running
The term runtime error used distinguish type error syntax error compiliation error occur program run
When program runtime phase application loaded RAM
This includes executable file library framework file referenced program
When program quit runtime period end memory used program made available use program
Time elapsed execution program
But general
Say duration compilation program OS presenting recipe programmer interact see outcome developed called runtime
No syntax error etc presented runtime

logic correct technically business perspetcive
So way say compileTime primary level runtime secondary level

I work programmer computer science background recently I following along excellent MIT OpenCourseWare intro Computer Science Programming
In course question asked program written using function definition call basic arithmetic operator assignment conditionals run constant time
I thought answer yes since operation seem pretty simple
But smart people probably already knew correct answer apparently potential indefinite recursion
It seems like I understand implication constant time
The way I pictured meaning sounded like meant simple operation would take known amount time complete
I accept recursion lead program running forever individual operation still taking finite measurable amount time even infinite number
Or answer mean two infinitely recursive program validly said take amount time run
If anyone give authoritative definition constant time implication thereof I grateful
Constant time effectively mean give constant upper bound long program take run affected input parameter
Compare say linear time input often actually input data rather direct value mean upper bound time taken expressed value
Note mean program take amount time input data run constant time
For example consider method That work case case zero
However still constant time going one comparison one addition one multiplication
Now compare recursive function This recurse time linear
You get much worse linear however
Consider method computing Fibonacci number That much worse previous version upper bound easily expressed term O
It still using simple comparison addition function call though
Constant time mean operation execute amount time memory space another thing often measured input size
Usually pick variable let use indicate input size
constant time running time depend linear time running time quadratic time running time These example possibility endless
See wiki article Here specific way program composed operation mention could take various amount time Note three length independent
Now run value linear time And bit fun What running time

many execute
Constant time meaning O mean algorithm run fixed amount time mean proportional input
input computed amount time even amount time really long
In constant time generally mean time take compute result independent size input
For example
Calculating length list vector managed language done constant time matter large list
The size stored separate field updated list grows shrink
But calculating count simple reading field
Calculating size doubly linked list often constant time
The list often mutated end hence central place store count
Hence determining length list necessitates visiting determining many element
So list grows time take calculate answer
Constant time mean dependent number input input allowed goto way make depend number input conditionals recursion
Although could argue recursion necessary debatable solution
Eg
C The real important thing consider time scale function number element
In constant time mean time remains matter many element involved layman explanation
If program run forever complete known amount time complete
We applying concept constant time run entire program individual step
constant time mean time depending amount input
In constant time mean matter input program run longer known amount time
Consider factorial function counterexample
The factorial say calculated like This obviously take le time compute factorial latter program five multiplication So constant time mean know long program run case never run longer known amount time upper bound

This first three post series
The second post talk
The third article talk
notation used really scary concept
I thought real programmer talked code
It scary academic description made little sense
This frustrating underlying concept actually hard
Simply put notation programmer talk algorithm
Algorithms another scary topic I cover another post purpose let say algorithm mean function program far
A function notation determined responds different input
How much slower give list thing work instead list thing
Consider code So call function like pretty quick
We loop thing list find first argument function return True
If get end find return False
The complexity function
I explain mean second let break mathematical syntax
read Order N function also known Order function
I think approximation deal order magnitude
Orders magnitude mathematical term basically tell difference class number
Think difference
If picture closest friend people really big difference
Similarly difference pretty big fact difference junker car lightly used one
It turn approximation long within order magnitude pretty close
If guess number gumballs machine within order magnitude said gumballs
gumballs would
A gumball machine whose number gumballs probably within order magnitude
Back dissecting say graph time take run function different sized input
array item item item etc see approximately corresponds number item array
This called linear graph
This mean line basically straight graph
Some may caught code sample item always first item list code would really fast
This true approximate performance something
The worst case code thing searching list
Note The math term upper bound mean talking mathematic limit awfulness
If wanted see graph function ignore function change variable
You type Wolfram Alpha plot x show diagonal line
The reason swap n x graphing program want variable name corresponds x axis
The getting bigger left right corresponds giving bigger bigger array function
The represents time higher line slower
Runtime characteristic O n function So example
Consider function This bit silly example bear
This function called called constant time
What mean matter big input always take amount time compute thing
If go back Wolfram see always stay matter far right go
If pas list million integer take time going pas list integer
Constant time considered best case scenario function
Runtime characteristic O function Consider function This match every item list every item list
If gave array get back
This part field mathematical field study combination thing
This function algorithm want sound fancy considered
This every item list aka input size operation
So
Below comparison graph reference
You see function get slow quickly something operates constant time much better
This particularly useful come data structure I post soon
Comparison O n v O n v O function This pretty high level overview notation hopefully get acquainted topic
There give depth view topic warned hop mathematic notation quickly
If anything make sense send
I also written
I thinking writing book topic
If something like see please express interest

Featuring Security News Tips Review There many type computer security threat world
Some pretty harmful totally harmless although annoying
There also damage computer capability empty number bank account
If really interested find threat I get cup coffee start

Trojan one complicated threat among
Most popular banking threat come Trojan family Zeus SpyEye
It ability hide antivirus detection steal important banking data compromise bank account
If Trojan really powerful take entire security system well
As result Trojan cause many type damage starting computer online account

Looking technology year back Virus something really popular
It malicious program replicates aim destroy computer
The ultimate goal virus ensure victim computer never able operate properly even
It popular today Malware today designed earn money destruction
As result Virus available people want use sort revenge purpose

One harmless threat program designed spread
It alter system cause nightmare computer spread one computer another computer within network even internet
The computer security risk use computer hard disk space due replication took bandwidth due spread

Is Malware designed spy victim computer
If infected probably daily activity certain activity spied spyware find way contact host malware
Mostly use spyware know daily activity attacker make use information
Such browse sex toy week every day attacker try come sex toy scam cheat money

Scareware something plant system immediately inform hundred infection
The idea trick purchasing bogus claim remove threat
It cheating money approach little different scare buy

Something keep record every keystroke made keyboard
Keylogger powerful threat steal people login credential username password
It also usually powerful Trojan

Is form threat computer start popping lot advertisement
It material adult material ad make host money
It really harmful threat pretty annoying

Backdoor really Malware form method system vulnerable method attacker able bypass regular authentication service
It usually installed virus Trojan infection backdoor installed ease transfer effort threat

Is another threat work like Virus Worms
It harm system like Virus replicate via LAN network like Worms
An example Wabbit attack form DDoS attack

Exploit form software programmed specifically attack certain vulnerability
For instance web browser vulnerable vulnerable flash plugin exploit work web browser plugin
The way avoid hitting exploit always patch stuff software patch fix vulnerability

Botnet something installed BotMaster take control computer bot via Botnet infection
It mostly infects downloads even Trojan infection
The result threat victim computer bot used large scale attack like DDoS

This threat longer popular today looking technology year back still access internet using modem quite popular threat
What make use internet modem dial international number pretty costly
Today type threat popular Android make use phone call send SMS premium number

Looking name Dropper designed drop computer install something useful attacker Malware Backdoor
There two type Dropper one immediately drop install avoid Antivirus detection
Another type Dropper drop small file small file auto trigger download process download Malware

Fake Antivirus threat popular threat among Mac user month ago
Due reason Mac user seldom face virus infection scaring message tell computer infected virus pretty useful result purchasing bogus antivirus nothing

A fake website designed look almost like actual website form phishing attack
The idea attack trick user entering username password fake login form serf purpose stealing identity victim
Every form sent phishing site go actual server attacker controlled server
really Malware
It something used website store something computer
It ability store thing computer track activity within site
If really like existence cooky choose reject using cooky site know

Bluesnarfing unauthorized access specific mobile phone laptop PDA via Bluetooth connection
By unauthorized access personal stuff photo calender contact SMS revealed probably even stolen

Bluejacking also us Bluetooth technology serious Bluesnarfing
What connect Bluetooth device send message another Bluetooth device
It something damaging privacy device system compared Bluesnarfing threat

One famous thing done Anonymous send million traffic single server cause system certain security feature disable data stealing
This kind trick send lot traffic machine known Distributed Denial Service also known DDoS

It virus place code computer DOS boot sector also known Master Boot Record
It start injected boot period damage high difficult infect
All victim need realize boot sector virus remove bootable drive particular virus able boot

A browser hijacker us Trojan Malware take control victim web browsing session
It extremely dangerous especially victim trying send money via online banking best time hijacker alter destination bank account even amount

When I small I got tricked chain letter written friend
But chain letter stop era
It brings adult life well people like send chain letter Facebook account delete letter
It usually say forward particular message email people account deleted people really believe

Virus today spread document file well especially PDF document
Last time people advice simply execute EXE file today world today technology document file also avoided
It best use scan first opening single file feel suspicious

I sure whether encountered Mousetrapping Malware trap web browser particular website
If try type another website automatically redirect back
If try clicking navigation button also redirect back
If try close browser set homepage website never get threat unless remove

To really honest obfuscated Spam spam mail
It obfuscated way look like spamming message trick potential victim clicking
Spam mail today look genuine careful might fall offering

Pharming work le like phishing little tricky
There two type pharming one DNS poisoning DNS compromised traffic redirected attacker DNS
The type pharming edit HOST file even typed web browser still redirect another site
One thing similar equally dangerous

Crimeware form Malware take control computer commit computer crime
Instead hacker committing crime plant Trojan whatever Malware called order commit crime instead
This make hacker clean whatever crime done

SQL injection infect end user directly
It towards infecting website vulnerable attack
What gain unauthorized access database attacker retrieve valuable information stored database

In possible danger might exploit breach security therefore cause possible harm
A threat either
hacking individual cracker criminal organization
possibility computer malfunctioning possibility otherwise circumstance capability action event
defines A comprehensive definition tied point view found defines give similar definition defines defines give articulated definition The term threat relates basic security term shown following diagram A resource physical logical one vulnerability exploited threat agent threat action
The result potentially compromise property resource potentially different vulnerable one organization others involved party customer supplier
The basis
The attempt alter system resource affect operation compromise Integrity Availability
A attempt learn make use information system affect system resource compromise Confidentiality
see figure depicts phenomenon slightly different term threat agent attack vector exploit weakness vulnerability system related causing technical impact IT resource asset connected business impact
A set policy concerned information security management ISMS developed manage according principle order accomplish security strategy set following rule regulation applicable country
Countermeasures also called security control applied transmission information named
The overall picture represents risk scenario
The widespread computer dependency consequent raising consequence successful attack led new term
It noted nowadays many real attack exploit least much technology
method called technique
The application specifically mean get touch people charge system administration even system security inducing reveal sensitive information
One famous case
The widespread documentation technical threat serious study apply cost effective countermeasure conducted following rigorous framework ISMS pure technical approach let psychological attack increasing threat
Threats classified according type origin Note threat type multiple origin
People interested studying possible threat proposed threat classification called initial threat category Microsoft previously rated risk security threat using five category classification called
The model considered obsolete Microsoft
The category The DREAD name come initial five category listed
The spread network threat lead dangerous situation
In military civil field threat level defined example threat level used USA
Leading vendor publish global threat level website
The term used indicate individual group manifest threat
It fundamental identify would want exploit asset company might use company
Individuals within threat population Practically anyone anything right circumstance threat agent inept computer operator trash daily batch job typing wrong command regulator performing audit squirrel chew data cable
Threat agent take one following action asset It important recognize action affect different asset differently drive degree nature loss
For example potential productivity loss resulting destroyed stolen asset depends upon critical asset organization productivity
If critical asset simply illicitly accessed direct productivity loss
Similarly destruction highly sensitive asset play critical role productivity directly result significant productivity loss
Yet asset disclosed result significant loss competitive advantage reputation generate legal cost
The point combination asset type action asset determines fundamental nature degree loss
Which action threat agent take driven primarily agent motive financial gain revenge recreation etc
nature asset
For example threat agent bent financial gain le likely destroy critical server steal easily pawned asset like laptop
It important separate concept event threat agent get contact asset even virtually
network event threat agent act asset
OWASP collect list potential threat agent order prevent system designer programmer insert vulnerability software
Threat Agent Capabilities Intentions Past Activities These individual group classified follows A threat source wish compromise occur

Threat management involves wide variety threat including physical threat like flood fire
While ISMS risk assessment process incorporate threat management cyber threat remote buffer overflow risk assessment process include process threat intelligence management response procedure
Cyber Threat Management CTM emerging best practice managing cyber threat beyond basic risk assessment found ISMS
It enables early identification threat data driven situational awareness accurate timely threat mitigating action
CTM includes process proactively iteratively searching network detect isolate advanced threat evade existing security solution
This contrast traditional threat management measure typically involve investigation warning potential threat incident occurred
Threat hunting manual process security analyst sifts various data information using knowledge familiarity network create hypothesis potential threat
To even effective efficient however threat hunting partially automated well
In case analyst utilizes software harness UEBA inform analyst potential risk
The analyst investigates potential risk tracking suspicious behavior network
Thus hunting iterative process meaning must continuously carried loop beginning hypothesis

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

News view insight ESET security community By posted It generally antimalware software detects computer virus worm trojan horse threat scanning file using signature already
A signature could simple string like using find command word processor locate particular piece text complex tiny macro subroutine tell scanning engine look find
Signature scanning work well detecting threat already identified antimalware program detect new previously unseen threat
One method used
But heuristic work
Randy Abrams ESET Director Technical Education find following definition helpful explaining heuristic The science heuristic study information discovered learned
It explains one look problem find solution opposed
Often heuristic rule thumb one might learned
In computer science heuristic algorithm consistently performs quickly provides good result
But antimalware software heuristic also specialized meaning Heuristics refers set opposed specific set program detect malicious behavior without uniquely identify program responsible classic virus scanner work
identifying specific computer virus program
The heuristic engine used antimalware program might include rule following Some heuristic rule may heavier weight thus score higher others meaning match one particular rule likely indicate presence malicious software multiple match based different rule
Even advanced heuristic might trace instruction program code passing computer processor execution allow program run virtual environment sandbox examine behavior performed change made virtual environment forth
In effect antimalware software contain specialized emulator allow trick program thinking actually running computer instead examined antimalware software potential threat
Keep mind term program used necessarily mean executable program file file
A heuristic engine could examining process structure memory data portion payload packet travelling network forth
Likewise heuristic engine simply scan file like classic antivirus program looking known pattern
It might trace instruction program passing code processor execution allow program run virtual environment sandbox examine behavior performed change made virtual environment forth
The advantage heuristic analysis code detect variant modified form existing malicious program new malicious program well
Combined way looking malware signature detection behavioral monitoring reputation analysis heuristic offer impressive accuracy
That correctly detecting high proportion real malware yet exhibiting low false positive alarm rate well since misdiagnosing innocent file malicious cause severe problem
Understanding heuristic work something specialty antimalware field
If interested would like know field I would suggest white paper written David Harley Andrew Lee
For technical examination technology Peter Szor book though several year old still worth reading
Author ESET Hello
ESET virus researcher said file already detected generic signature detects advanced heuristic
Please explain
Generic signature use variety technology
ESET generic signature complex time involve use advanced heuristic time
This part way improve detection keeping false positive low
Thanks answer
Another question fix false positive
Add checksum ESET whitelist something else
There numerous way false positive alarm fixed heuristic checksum hash various type
The exact method would vary based underlying reason false positive occurred
I fix false positive virus lab job It really depends upon false positive
Sometimes modification signature used fix false positive
Sometimes change heuristic required fix false positive
Whitelisting relatively rarely used fix false positive case warranted
Heuristics also known unproved method seem work practice
In term heuristic silver bullet usually yield false positive false negative
Those metric usually difficult evaluate actually people try evaluate heuristic wrong
We know antivirus software perfect usually updated old fashioned signature detection trustable process year experience
Heuristics younger security professional I would need objective reproducible metric heuristic efficiency
So I able manage risk decide worth take risk rely heuristic I used classic signature critical host
Signature scanning heuristic scanning technology many year Matthieu
Around I McAfee Associates began using called fuzzy logic detect subsequently remove boot sector master boot record infecting virus
If ever came across report Generic Boot Generic MBR virus VIRUSCAN type heuristic underlying technology used although use term
The first time I actually heard heuristic Fridrik Skulason around
I believe Frans Veldman Righard Zwienenberg also independently developed heuristic ESaSS ThunderByte well
Classic signature generate false positive false negative alarm saw several case last year
Heuristics ESET case used conjunction classic signature
Together actually reduce chance false positive false negative alarm
As far testing go retrospective testing software one way testing heuristic done Freeze signature update running program newer malware see detected
Results course decay time repeated testing allow determine well heuristic detection performing
Heuristics usually yield false Signatures usually yield false negative signature specific threat prone miss every threat
AV without heuristic viable today
Generic signature type heuristic approach used virtually every antivirus vendor
It would foolish rely heuristic signature alone rely upon security product alone
Hi thanks feedback
From I post I though called heuristic related program behavior
From point view regular expression merely signature
I agree signature yield false positive false negative
Nevertheless mechanism known controled ie taking instance false alarm straighforward understand cause error
When dealing behavior quite complex
Concerning Heuristics usually yield false positive trust good control better
There hardly reproducible study false positive false negative
For example VB test reproducible since test case remains proprietary
Heuristics unproved method inspired intuition seem work practice
I think foolishness reliying obscure technlogy neither controlable provable
Heuristics hardly obsure
Heuristics used virtually antivirus product today
There way test false positive false negative
False positive easily tested scan signature new program change existing signature heuristic may create false positive point
For testing efficacy retrospective testing
You freeze product period time collect brand new threat known exist time product last updated
At end period time scan without updating
Anything detected heuristic detection exception anything missed false negative
When looking result standard testing combined retrospective testing becomes pretty clear combination technology offer significantly better protection
Muy agradecido por toda la informacion Can Heuristics trigger detection similarity Generic signature wildcard found
Hello Yes could heuristic rule

This term coined United States became greater concern business since spread around world
The people make company workforce human resource considered asset company like financial resource material resource building machinery equipment
A company likely successful manages resource well including people
This many company human resource department even though department directly contribute company production service sale profit
Rather effective HR department allow encourage company employee best turn contributes success company
One main role HR department managing current employee
Unlike manager directly oversee employee work HR department deal concern benefit pay company policy training
Among benefit might handled HR department insurance plan paid vacation paid leave illness health matter pension plan employee investment
The HR department also might settle conflict employee employee manager well grievance filed company employee
Human resource also involves acquisition new employee
HR worker might involved recruiting potential employee advertisement job fair
In case HR department try hire certain type people least ensure certain type people improve diversity company workforce
For example company might look candidate belong certain minority demographic
The HR department often collect review job application forwarding best applicant appropriate manager organization
The hiring process might also include background check credit check drug testing
After new employee hired HR department typically provides orientation including instruction company policy ensures employee properly trained job
A company HR department also play role employee leaf company reason
If employee fired otherwise let go wish certain task must performed HR department ensure process done legally
In case must offered negotiated outstanding balance paid vacation time benefit must settled

HR hard job
You face different people
My husband work factory push button day long
This something trained monkey I call worthless I know good job
Do judge others walked shoe day
I work HR put hour day job includes schedule time request benefit orientation onboarding monitor review wage increase counseling legal compliance investigation recruiting maintaining employee file ADA accommodation interviewing much
I get involved party planning celebration small part job
HR nothing actual job
They waste company valuable money
For one want work HR please rethink pull best real use company join
Do guy really want end sitting chair absolutely nothing throughout day
After employee reported first time get warning get fired automatically
How work
As professional social worker I get degree human resource
I hate HR staff
They often biggest waste money lot organization
All management ask timesheet human resource staff day account hour
This huge majority organization massively overstaffed human resource staff realistically little nothing day long surf net puzzle read book
For actually say give list realistically account tiny amount time add
They slack
HR staff dull
If intelligent would really HR
No
HR If real regular employee know HR big good idea tell management suggest aspect even streamlined right away
You save ten even hundred thousand process little loss
Because HR find hard lie timesheets easily isolate slacker useless one get rid promptly
When looking streamline organization get rid employee getting rid HR department first great idea obviously ca earn money
At least HR staff switched
Challenging accounting time least minute increment always great idea
Human resource staff grow like virus left unchecked
Once company even worse college public service get control try spawn employ human resource staff job
They usually claim extra necessary legal reason paperwork increased realistically often find still ca account time
It mask I want someone work If HR department level corporation turn hundred million year let HR get control take thousand organization every payday
In college Hampshire UK HR staff real employee
I like ask question In organization staff full time HR staff truthfully day long
The answer bit fat
The higher level HR staff delegate work HR staff staff generally rushed foot much work
And come application get worse
HR without doubt absolutely selecting people application let near
If charge sized organization worst thing human resource sift application
This HR staff blind ticker look actual talent people invent really make money
For example job application really much problem single person sift HR staff would believe take forever choose choose

protection theft damage well service provide
Cyber security includes controlling physical access hardware well protecting harm may come via network access data code injection
Also due operator whether accidental security susceptible deviating secure procedure various method
The field growing importance due increasing reliance computer system growth including tiny device part Internet Things
A vulnerability weakness design implementation operation internal control
Most vulnerability discovered documented CVE database
An vulnerability one least one working attack exists
Vulnerabilities often hunted exploited aid manually using customized script
To secure computer system important understand attack made typically classified one category A computer system algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security control
They may exist number reason including original design poor configuration
They may added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reason regardless motif existence create vulnerability
DoS designed make machine network resource unavailable intended user
Attackers deny service individual victim deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive time cause victim account locked may overload capability machine network block user
While network attack single IP address blocked adding new firewall rule many form DDoS attack possible attack come large number point defending much difficult
Such attack originate range technique possible including innocent system fooled sending traffic victim
An unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data
They may also compromise security making modification installing software using wireless mouse
Even system protected standard security measure may able booting another operating system tool bootable medium
designed prevent attack
act surreptitiously listening private conversation typically host network
For instance program used eavesdrop system
Even machine operate closed system contact outside world eavesdropped upon via monitoring faint transmission generated hardware specification NSA referring attack
act masquerading valid entity falsification data username order gain access information resource one otherwise unauthorized obtain
There several type spoofing including describes malicious modification product
security service planting surveillance capability router example
describes situation attacker level restricted access able without authorization elevate privilege access level
For example standard computer user may able fool system giving access restricted data even full unrestricted access system
attempt acquire sensitive information usernames password credit card detail directly user
Phishing typically carried often directs user enter detail fake website whose look feel almost identical legitimate one
Preying victim trust phishing classified form
also known UI redress attack User Interface redress attack malicious technique attacker trick user clicking button link another webpage user intended click top level page
This done using multiple transparent opaque layer
The attacker basically click meant top level page routing irrelevant page likely owned someone else
A similar technique used hijack keystroke
Carefully drafting combination stylesheets iframes button text box user led believing typing password information authentic webpage channeled invisible frame controlled attacker
aim convince user disclose secret password card number etc
example impersonating bank contractor customer
A common scam involves fake CEO email sent accounting finance department
In early reported scam cost US business two year
In May team victim type cyber scam perpetrator impersonating team president resulting handover team employee tax form
Employee behavior big impact information security organization
Cultural concept help different segment organization work effectively work effectiveness towards information security within Relationship Organizational Culture Information Security provides following definition information security culture totality pattern behavior organization contribute protection information Andersson Reimers found employee often see part organization Information Security effort often take action ignore organizational Information Security best interest
Research show Information security culture need improved continuously
In Security Culture Analysis author commented never ending process cycle evaluation change To manage information security culture five step taken strategic planning operative planning implementation
The growth number computer system increasing reliance upon individual business industry government mean increasing number system risk
The computer system financial regulator financial institution like SWIFT investment bank commercial bank prominent hacking target cybercriminals interested manipulating market making illicit gain
Web site apps accept store brokerage account information also prominent hacking target potential immediate financial gain transferring money making purchase selling information
payment system also tampered order gather customer account data
Computers control function many utility including coordination valve opening closing water gas network
The Internet potential attack vector machine connected worm demonstrated even equipment controlled computer connected Internet vulnerable
In division investigated hacking incident energy company
Vulnerabilities many use local radio cellular communication cause problem billing fraud
The industry reliant series complex system could attacked
A simple power outage one airport cause repercussion worldwide much system relies radio transmission could disrupted controlling aircraft ocean especially dangerous radar surveillance extends mile offshore
There also potential attack within aircraft
In Europe NewPENS US NextGen program moving create dedicated network
The consequence successful attack range loss confidentiality loss system integrity outage loss aircraft even loss life
Desktop computer laptop commonly targeted gather password financial account information construct attack another target
device like sensor camera microphone GPS receiver compass could exploited may collect personal information including sensitive health information
Wifi Bluetooth cell phone network device could used attack vector sensor might remotely activated successful breach
The increasing number device also potential target
Large corporation common target
In many case aimed financial gain identity theft involves loss million client credit card detail recent breach
Some cyberattacks ordered foreign government government engage intent spread propaganda sabotage spy target
Many people believe Russian government played major role US presidential election using Twitter Facebook affect result election whether true ultimately determined congress
Medical record targeted use general identify theft health insurance fraud impersonating patient obtain prescription drug recreational purpose resale
Although cyber threat continue increase organization increase security training business
Not attack financially motivated however example security firm suffered serious series attack group retaliation firm CEO claiming infiltrated group motive appears embarrass data leak cripple company wiping workstation server
Vehicles increasingly computerized engine timing seat belt tensioners door lock many model
Additionally may use bluetooth communicate onboard consumer device cell phone network
expected even complex
All system carry security risk issue gained wide attention
Simple example risk include malicious used attack vector car onboard microphone used eavesdropping
However access gained car internal danger much greater widely publicised test hacker remotely carjacked vehicle mile away drove ditch
Manufacturers reacting number way pushing security fix air car computer system
In area autonomous vehicle September announced initial safety standard called state come uniform policy
Government computer system commonly attacked activist foreign power
Local regional government infrastructure control police intelligence agency communication student record financial system also potential target largely computerized
government control access facility use vulnerable
The IoT network physical object device vehicle building enables collect exchange data concern raised developed without appropriate consideration security challenge involved
While IoT creates opportunity direct integration physical world system also provides opportunity misuse
In particular Internet Things spread widely cyber attack likely become increasingly physical rather simply virtual threat
If front door lock connected Internet phone criminal could enter home press button stolen hacked phone
People could stand lose much credit card number world controlled device
Thieves also used electronic mean circumvent hotel door lock
either successfully attacked potentially deadly vulnerability demonstrated including diagnostic equipment implanted device including
There many report hospital hospital organization getting hacked including attack exploit virus sensitive data stored hospital server
On December US released recommendation medical maintain security device structure enforcement
Serious financial damage caused standard model estimating cost incident data available made public organization involved
Several computer security consulting firm produce estimate total worldwide loss attributable attack hostile digital act general
The loss estimate firm range billion worm virus billion form covert attack
The reliability estimate often challenged underlying methodology basically anecdotal
Security breach continue cost business billion dollar survey revealed security staff believe senior leadership take cyber precaution strategic priority
However reasonable estimate financial cost security breach actually help organization make rational investment decision
According classic analyzing optimal investment level information security one conclude amount firm spends protect information generally small fraction expected loss loss resulting
As motivation breach computer security vary attacker
Some activist others criminal looking financial gain
attacker common well resourced started amateur hacked recounted
A standard part particular system identify might motivate attack system might motivated breach
The level detail precaution vary depending system secured
A home military face different threat even underlying technology use similar
In computer security countermeasure action device procedure technique reduces eliminating preventing minimizing harm cause discovering reporting corrective action taken
End user security habit
Reimers Andersson conducted number study end user security habit found type repeated security best practice marked effect perception compliance good end user network security habit especially concerning malware ransomeware
Some common countermeasure listed following section alternately secure design mean software designed ground secure
In case security considered main feature
Some technique approach include The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture design describe security control security countermeasure positioned relate overall
These control serve purpose maintain system quality attribute confidentiality integrity availability accountability
Techopedia defines security architecture unified security design address necessity potential risk involved certain scenario environment
It also specifies apply security control
The design process generally reproducible
The key attribute security architecture A state computer security conceptual ideal attained use three process threat prevention detection response
These process based various policy system component include following Today computer security comprises mainly preventive measure like firewall
A firewall defined way filtering network data host network another network implemented software running machine hooking case operating system built operating system provide real time filtering blocking
Another implementation physical firewall consists separate machine filtering network traffic
Firewalls common amongst machine permanently connected
Some organization turning platform extend data accessibility detect
However relatively organisation maintain computer system effective detection system fewer still organised response mechanism place
As result Reuters point Companies first time report losing electronic theft data physical stealing asset
The primary obstacle effective eradication cyber crime could traced excessive reliance firewall automated detection system
Yet basic evidence gathering using put criminal behind bar
Vulnerability management cycle identifying remediating mitigating especially
Vulnerability management integral computer security
Vulnerabilities discovered analyzes computer system search known vulnerability insecure software configuration susceptibility Beyond vulnerability scanning many organisation contract outside security auditor run regular system identify vulnerability
In sector contractual requirement
While correctness computer system possible yet common
Operating system formally verified include make small percentage market
properly implemented virtually impossible directly break
Breaking requires input stolen key stolen plaintext either end transmission extra cryptanalytic information
method mitigating unauthorized access system sensitive information
It requires something know password PIN something card dongle cellphone piece hardware
This increase security unauthorized person need gain access
The tight security measure le unauthorized hack
Social engineering direct computer access physical attack prevented mean difficult enforce relative sensitivity information
Training often involved help mitigate risk even highly disciplined environment
military organization social engineering attack still difficult foresee prevent
Enoculation derived seek prevent social engineering fraudulent trick trap instilling resistance persuasion attempt exposure similar related attempt
It possible reduce attacker chance keeping system date security patch update using security scanner hiring competent people responsible security
The effect data reduced careful
While hardware may source insecurity microchip vulnerability maliciously introduced manufacturing process assisted computer security also offer alternative computer security
Using device method case drive lock disabling USB port access may considered secure due physical access sophisticated required order compromised
Each covered detail
One use term computer security refers technology used implement secure
In DoD used standard current international standard defines number progressively stringent
Many common operating system meet standard Methodically Designed Tested Reviewed required highest level mean uncommon
An example Semiformally Verified Design Tested system used several military jet
In software engineering aim guard accidental introduction security vulnerability
It also possible create software designed ground secure
Such system
Beyond aim prove underlying system important example
Within computer system two many capable enforcing privilege separation ACLs
Using ACLs confine program proven insecure many situation host computer tricked indirectly allowing restricted file access issue known
It also shown promise ACLs giving access object one person never guaranteed practice
Both problem resolved capability
This mean practical flaw exist system designer certain utility must take responsibility ensure introduce flaw
Capabilities mostly restricted research commercial OSs still use ACLs
Capabilities however also implemented language level leading style programming essentially refinement standard design
An open source project area
The secure computer connected Internet shielded interference
In real world secure system
Responding forcefully attempted manner one would attempted physical security breach often difficult variety reason Some illustrative example different type computer security breach given
In computer connected Internet mainframe minicomputer professional workstation
On November many started slow running malicious code demanded processor time spread computer first internet

The computer worm known reportedly ruined almost Iran disrupting industrial PLCs targeted attack generally believed launched Israel United States although neither publicly admitted
In early document provided published exposing massive scale global surveillance
It also revealed NSA deliberately inserted backdoor standard encryption tapped link data centre
In hacking ring known Rescator broke computer stealing roughly million credit card computer stealing million credit card number
Warnings delivered corporation ignored physical security breach using believed played large role
The malware utilized absolutely unsophisticated uninteresting say Jim Walter director threat intelligence operation security technology company McAfee meaning heist could easily stopped existing administrator responded warning
The size theft resulted major attention state Federal United States authority investigation ongoing
In April year earlier data breach resulting theft approximately million personnel record handled office
The Office Personnel Management hack described federal official among largest breach government data history United States
Data targeted breach included name date place birth address fingerprint current former government employee well anyone undergone government background check
It believed hack perpetrated Chinese hacker motivation remains unclear
In July hacker group known The Impact Team successfully breached extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison
The group claimed taken company data user data well
After breach The Impact Team dumped email company CEO prove point threatened dump customer data unless website taken permanently
With initial data release group stated instructed take Ashley Madison Established Men offline permanently form release customer record including profile customer secret sexual fantasy matching credit card transaction real name address employee document email
The website may stay online
When Avid Life Media parent company created Ashley Madison website take site offline The Impact Group released two compressed file one second
After second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned website remained functional

Computer Science All President bold new initiative empower American student kindergarten high school learn computer science equipped computational thinking skill need creator digital economy consumer active citizen world
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing computer science CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility
CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example
These statistic mirror current makeup America largest innovative tech firm woman compose le technical employee le percent
We better
Tech career exciting fun collaborative well critical economy
We want Americans opportunity part team
CS For All help make reality ensure every student access Computer Science classroom level
When come computer science student President Obama led way CS Student became first President write line code
His first line code moveForward CS All moving forward together
Who taught code
A student named Adrianna Newark New Jersey took computer science course school
If President start learning computer science
We know need basic tool make possible including teacher infrastructure
Thanks President well way making happen closing connectivity divide school half empowering million student broadband enlisting school district cause
And order make sure youth pathway workforce adult access skill President expanded city state rural area
Grace Clark sophomore International High School New Orleans Louisiana intern Operation Spark offer free technology training coding course young people New Orleans
Grace worked New Orleans Police Department policing data event taught New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison write first line code
She also teach coding child Arthur Ashe Elementary attended Essence Festival represent inner city youth coding technology
Christina Li senior Adlai Stevenson High School Macomb Michigan She Vice President Controls FIRST robotics team ThunderChickens
Christina also created Hello World computer science day camp middle school girl learn code robot apps website game hope reducing gender gap computer science
Angelica Willis computer science student North Carolina Agricultural Technical State University Greensboro North Carolina
She used computer science skill help NASA develop ecological forecasting model using satellite support reforestation Rwanda
She spearhead initiative develop entrepreneurship design Maker Space youth underrepresented community Greensboro
The field computer science education come long way year
With support new high school course like Exploring Computer Science AP Principles Computer Science designed inclusive accessible student course program designed early elementary school
NSF also funded middle school freshman focused course called Bootstrap curriculum emerged teach computer science computational thinking elementary middle high school
Because CS active applied field Science Technology Engineering Math STEM learning allows student engage interaction key math science engineering principle give student opportunity creator consumer digital economy active citizen world
CS also help foster computational thinking skill relevant many discipline career breaking large problem smaller one recognizing new problem relate problem already solved setting aside detail problem le important identifying refining step needed reach solution
CS also complement President initiative focus growing democratization hardware software tool needed design make anything
As teacher school leader superintendent help expand CS All many different way
For example Spanish computer science teacher creative director Young Women Leadership School Astoria New York integrated digital education coding class including Spanish
Andrea also lead group student known Tech Crew composed filmmaker graphic designer coder website designer project manager
Under Andrea guidance young woman collaborate solve problem around school like teaching student recycling coding educational video game
grade science teacher Cloonan Middle School Stamford Connecticut
Jim Stamford Public Schools Teacher Year
He planed city wide STEM festival providing STEM professional development curate popular STEM Education Twitter handle stemnetwork
He also sponsor Computer Coding Club printing club Cloonan Middle School
assistant professor computer science University Nevada Las Vegas
For last decade creating technology make easier people including disability write computer software
With grant NSF established first national educational infrastructure blind visually impaired student learn computer science
He inventor Quorum first programming language
States city leader movement expand CS education
In responding President call action give student opportunity learn CS
In past year Republican Democratic state leader championed ambitious CS effort New York City announced aggressive plan expand CS opportunity student
Today leader state local level announcing new expanded commitment expand CS including The Chattanooga community worked together create ecosystem youth learn computer science skill prepared future industry
Cordell Carter Chief Executive Officer TechTown Foundation learning center offer program child skill level age
TechTown approach aim give youth experience allowing kid discover learn explore limitless possibility imagination
researcher University California Los Angeles investigates woman student color learned computer science
She collaborator support National Science Foundation created Exploring Computer Science high school curriculum teacher professional development program committed reaching student especially underserved community school exists across nation including seven largest school district
retired computer science math teacher Houston Texas advocated Computer Science education since
She fought keep computer science certification teacher played integral part increasing programming computational thinking Texas math standard
She serf affiliate Code Buddy Spring Branch Independent School District
A growing list district leader committing support President vision expanded computer science curriculum student
Dozens private sector partner nonprofit organization well state local government stepped support CS All commitment
Today announcement build upon bipartisan progress state like Washington Arkansas
Both state announced ambitious computer science education effort passed legislation make computer science count towards high school graduation
Similarly city like New York Chicago San Francisco already announced major expansion computer science education
Local leader using computer science solve many intractable local challenge opportunity Check
Involving young people real problem help solve community best practice education exciting youth
typically significant computer science opportunity American youth pull partner solving challenge engaging future
Seattle leadership hosted involving community member across city
New Orleans engaging youth others open data initiative part work Police Data Initiative city
Denver library hosting camp
Let youth engagement part learning experience
Businesses philanthropy also played major role building movement expand CS nationally

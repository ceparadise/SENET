In object whose value refers another value stored elsewhere using
A pointer location memory obtaining value stored location known pointer
As analogy page number book index could considered pointer corresponding page dereferencing pointer would done flipping page given page number reading text found indexed page
Pointers data significantly improve performance repetitive operation traversing structure
In particular often much cheaper time space copy dereference pointer copy access data pointer point
Pointers also used hold address entry point subroutine
In used often using called
A pointer simple concrete implementation abstract
Several language support type pointer although restriction use others
While pointer used refer reference general properly applies whose explicitly allows pointer manipulated arithmetically via memory address opposed possible
Because pointer allow protected unprotected access memory address risk associated using particularly latter case
Primitive pointer often stored format similar however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To alleviate potential problem matter pointer considered separate type parameterized type data point even underlying representation integer
Other measure may also taken validation bound checking verify content pointer variable contain value valid memory address within numerical range processor capable addressing
credited invention pointer
In Lawson presented Computer Pioneer Award f inventing pointer variable introducing concept thus providing first time capability flexibly treat linked list high level language
According first appeared print technical memorandum
In pointer kind
A datum read written using one memory access instance primitive
A group primitive contiguous memory viewed collectively one datum instance aggregate could logically contiguous byte value represent coordinate point space
When aggregate entirely composed type primitive aggregate may called sense primitive array byte program use word way
In context definition smallest primitive specifies different byte
The memory address initial byte datum considered memory address entire datum
A primitive value intended used memory address said
It also said pointer value datum memory address
More generally pointer kind said obtain datum
The feature separate pointer kind reference pointer value meant interpreted memory address rather concept
References serve level indirection A pointer value determines memory address datum used calculation
Because indirection fundamental aspect algorithm pointer often expressed fundamental typed programming language pointer determines type datum pointer point
When setting like tree necessary pointer help manage structure implemented controlled
Typical example pointer start pointer end pointer pointer
These pointer either actual absolute start address base typically us fewer bit full address usually require one additional arithmetic operation resolve
Relative address form manual share many advantage disadvantage
A offset containing unsigned integer used provide relative addressing kilobyte data structure
This easily extended address pointed forced word boundary requiring additional shift left order adjust offset factor addition base address
Generally though scheme lot trouble convenience programmer absolute address underlying preferred
A one byte offset hexadecimal value character
used point alternative integer value index array

In way character efficiently translated usable sequential absolute address without
used control usually make extensive use pointer
The pointer usually embedded table entry may instance used hold entry point executed based certain condition defined table entry
The pointer however simply index separate associated table comprising array actual address address depending upon programming language construct available
They also used point earlier table entry loop processing forward skip table entry early exit loop
For latter purpose pointer may simply table entry number transformed actual address simple arithmetic
Pointers thin top addressing capability provided modern
In simplest scheme numeric assigned unit memory system unit typically either depending whether architecture effectively transforming memory large
The system would also provide operation retrieve value stored memory unit given address usually utilizing machine
In usual case pointer large enough hold address unit memory system
This introduces possibility program may attempt access address corresponds unit memory either enough memory installed
beyond range available memory architecture support address
The first case may certain platform architecture called segfault
The second case possible current implementation pointer bit long address extend bit
Pointers must conform certain rule canonical address pointer dereferenced processor raise
On hand system unit memory address
In case complex scheme employed use different part memory different time
The last incarnation architecture support bit physical memory address mapped linear address space paging mechanism
Thus possible total memory may accessed time
Another example computer family processor though supporting MB physical memory could access GB virtual memory combination address segment register made accessing KB one data structure cumbersome
In order provide consistent interface architecture provide allows address refer unit memory others refer device computer
There analogous concept file offset array index remote object reference serve purpose address type object
Pointers directly supported without restriction language implicitly
They primarily used constructing turn fundamental constructing nearly well passing data different part program
In functional programming language rely heavily list pointer reference managed abstractly language using internal construct like
When dealing array critical operation typically involves stage called involves constructing pointer desired data element array
In data structure pointer used reference explicitly tie one piece structure another
Pointers used pas parameter reference
This useful programmer want function modification parameter visible function caller
This also useful returning multiple value function
Pointers also used deallocate dynamic variable array memory
Since variable often become redundant served purpose waste memory keep therefore good practice deallocate using original pointer reference longer needed
Failure may result available free memory gradually severe case rapidly diminishes accumulation numerous redundant memory block
The basic define pointer This declares identifier object following type This usually stated succinctly pointer
Because C language specify implicit initialization object automatic storage duration care often taken ensure address point valid sometimes suggested pointer explicitly initialized value traditionally specified C standardized macro Dereferencing null pointer C produce could catastrophic
However implementation simply halt execution program question usually
However initializing pointer unnecessarily could hinder program analysis thereby hiding bug
In case pointer declared next logical step point something This assigns value address
For example stored memory location value assignment
To dereference pointer asterisk used This mean take content locate address memory set value
If later accessed new value
This example may clearer memory examined directly
Assume located address memory also assume machine int wide
The following would memory following code snippet executed The NULL pointer shown
By assigning address yield following memory value Then dereferencing coding computer take content address assign location yielding following memory Clearly accessing yield value previous instruction modified content way pointer
In C array indexing formally defined term pointer arithmetic language specification requires equivalent
Thus C array thought pointer consecutive area memory gap syntax accessing array identical used dereference pointer
For example array declared used following manner This allocates block five integer name block act pointer block
Another common use pointer point dynamically allocated memory return consecutive block memory le requested size used array
While operator array pointer equivalent result operator differs
In example evaluate size array evaluate size pointer
Default value array declared like If located memory starting address machine memory contain following value like address Represented five integer
These five integer occupy bit byte byte stored first stored consecutively starting address
The syntax C pointer The last example access content
Breaking Below example definition This definition essentially definition empty list cell type another link also type
The definition reference however use potentially confusing signal value
For reason data structure C usually dealt via carefully checked correctness
Pointers used pas variable address allowing value changed
For example consider following code In program required memory depends may enter
In case programmer need allocate memory dynamically
This done allocating memory rather variable usually stored
Variables also stored CPU register another matter Dynamic memory allocation made pointer name like common variable ca given
Pointers used store manage address block memory
Such block used store data object array object
Most structured language provide area memory called object dynamically allocated
The example C code illustrates structure object dynamically allocated referenced
The provides function allocating memory block heap
It take size object allocate parameter return pointer newly allocated block memory suitable storing object return null pointer allocation failed
The code illustrates memory object dynamically deallocated returned heap free store
The standard C library provides function deallocating previously allocated memory block returning back heap
On computing architecture pointer used directly manipulate memory device
Assigning address pointer invaluable tool programming
Below simple example declaring pointer type int initialising address example constant In mid using access video capability PCs slow
Applications typically used access video memory directly casting constant pointer array unsigned int value
Each value consisted code low byte colour high byte
Thus put letter row column bright white blue one would write code like following In many language pointer additional restriction object point specific
For example pointer may declared point language attempt prevent programmer pointing object integer eliminating error
For example C would integer pointer would char pointer
The following would yield compiler warning assignment incompatible pointer type declared different type
To suppress compiler warning must made explicit indeed wish make assignment say cast integer pointer char pointer assign
A draft C standard requires casting pointer derived one type one another type maintain alignment correctness type Pointers par
In language allow pointer arithmetic arithmetic pointer take account size type
For example adding integer number pointer produce another pointer point address higher number time size type
This allows u easily compute address element array given type shown C array example
When pointer one type cast another type different size programmer expect pointer arithmetic calculated differently
In C example array start byte whereas byte point would point
Other risk casting include loss data wide data written narrow location
unexpected result value comparison problem especially signed v unsigned value
Although impossible general determine cast safe language store used confirm dangerous cast valid runtime
Other language merely accept conservative approximation safe cast none
As pointer allows program attempt access object may defined pointer origin variety
However usefulness pointer great difficult perform programming task without
Consequently many language created construct designed provide useful feature pointer without also sometimes referred
In context pointer directly address memory used article referred contrast smart pointer variant
One major problem pointer long directly manipulated number made point unused address data used purpose
Many language including recent like replace pointer opaque type reference typically referred simply used refer object manipulated number preventing type error
Array indexing handled special case
A pointer address assigned called
Any attempt use uninitialized pointer cause unexpected behavior either initial value valid address using may damage part program
The result often used function pointer branch address
In system explicit memory allocation possible create deallocating memory region point
This type pointer dangerous subtle deallocated memory region may contain data deallocated may reallocated overwritten unrelated code unknown earlier code
Languages prevent type error deallocation performed automatically reference scope
Some language like support use simple form help track allocation dynamic memory addition acting reference
In absence reference cycle object refers indirectly sequence smart pointer eliminate possibility dangling pointer memory leak
string support reference counting natively
The introduces optimisation based around eliminate pointer bug without resorting
A value reserved indicating pointer refer valid object
Null pointer routinely used represent condition end unknown length failure perform action use null pointer compared value
An pointer whose value interpreted offset address pointer thus data structure autorelative pointer member point portion data structure data structure may relocated memory without update value auto relative pointer
The cited patent also us term mean thing
However meaning term used way A pointer whose value offset value another pointer
This used store load block data assigning address beginning block base pointer
In language pointer reference another pointer requiring multiple dereference operation get original value
While level indirection may add performance cost sometimes necessary order provide correct behavior complex
For example C typical define term element contains pointer next element list This implementation us pointer first element list surrogate entire list
If new value added beginning list changed point new element
Since C argument always passed value using double indirection allows insertion implemented correctly desirable eliminating special case code deal insertion front list In case value le caller properly updated address new item
A basic example argument given prototype variable pointer array string array array pointer string convention name program character string
In language pointer reference executable code point function method procedure
A store address function invoked
While facility used call function dynamically often favorite technique virus malicious software writer
A pointer point valid object consequently may make program crash behave oddly
In pointer specifically initialized may point unpredictable address memory
The following example code show dangling pointer Here may point anywhere memory performing assignment corrupt unknown area memory trigger
In doubly back pointer held element back item referring current element
These useful navigation manipulation expense greater memory use
These pointer declaration cover variant pointer declaration
Of course possible triple pointer main principle behind triple pointer already exist double pointer
The higher priority
Where pointer used address entry point program start also either uninitialized corrupted call nevertheless made address said occurred
The consequence usually unpredictable error may present several different way depending upon whether pointer valid address whether coincidentally valid instruction opcode address
The detection wild branch present one difficult frustrating debugging exercise since much evidence may already destroyed beforehand execution one inappropriate instruction branch location
If available usually detect wild branch take effect also provide complete partial trace history
It possible simulate pointer behavior using index normally array
Primarily language support pointer explicitly support array thought processed entire memory range within scope particular array index thought equivalent assembly language point individual byte whose actual value relative start array absolute address memory
Assuming array say contiguous character individual byte contiguous byte within array directly addressed manipulated using name array bit unsigned simulated pointer quite similar example shown
Pointer arithmetic simulated adding subtracting index minimal additional overhead compared genuine pointer arithmetic
It even theoretically possible using technique together suitable simulate intermediate another language support pointer example
To achieve code initially loaded contiguous byte array simulator read interpret action entirely within memory contained array
If necessary completely avoid problem usually actioned compiler hand coded simulator
strongly typed language pointer typed safe type conversion permitted
All pointer default initialized attempt access data pointer cause raised
Pointers Ada called
Ada permit arithmetic access type although many compiler vendor provided feature Ada support safe arithmetic access type via package
Several old version Windows platform support STRPTR return address string VARPTR return address variable
Visual Basic also support OBJPTR return address object interface ADDRESSOF operator return address function
The type integer value equivalent held pointer type
Newer dialect exhaustive pointer implementation however
In FreeBASIC arithmetic pointer equivalent C treated though pointer byte width
pointer dereferenced Also casting type pointer generate warning
In pointer variable store address
Each pointer type point one freely cast pointer type function pointer object pointer
A special pointer type called void pointer allows pointing object limited fact dereferenced directly shall cast
The address often directly manipulated casting pointer integral type sufficient size though result may indeed cause undefined behavior earlier C standard integral type guaranteed large enough specifies defined implementation need provide
fully support C pointer C typecasting
It also support new group typecasting operator help catch unintended dangerous cast
Since also provides used situation safer alternative primitive C pointer
also support another form reference quite different pointer called simply
ability modify pointer target address arithmetic operation well magnitude comparison restricted language standard remain within bound single array object otherwise invoke
Adding subtracting pointer move multiple size
For example adding pointer integer value increment pointer
This effect incrementing pointer point next element contiguous array often intended result
Pointer arithmetic performed pointer size thus pointed address added although compiler perform byte arithmetic extension treating
Pointer arithmetic provides programmer single way dealing different type adding subtracting number element required instead actual offset byte
Pointer arithmetic pointer us byte offset definition
In particular C definition explicitly declares syntax element array equivalent content element pointed
This implies equivalent one write equally well access fourth element array
While powerful pointer arithmetic source
It tends confuse novice forcing different context expression ordinary arithmetic one pointer arithmetic one sometimes easy mistake one
In response many modern computer language example permit direct access memory using address
Also safe C dialect address many issue pointer
See discussion
The supported ANSI C generic pointer type
A pointer store address object function C implicitly converted object pointer type assignment must explicitly cast dereferenced
C used pointer purpose ANSI C
allow implicit conversion pointer type even assignment
This design decision avoid careless even unintended cast though compiler output warning error encountering cast
In reference void complement pointer void reference behave like alias variable point never variable whose type
In pointer supported certain condition block code including pointer must marked keyword
Such block usually require higher security permission allowed run
The syntax essentially address pointed either memory
However pointer managed memory pointer managed object must declared using keyword prevents moving pointed object part memory management pointer scope thus keeping pointer address valid
An exception using structure safe managed equivalent require unsafe code
This type often returned using method example The framework includes many class method namespaces class convert type example many type pointer example allow communication
Most method security permission requirement unmanaged code since affect arbitrary place memory
The programming language support pointer variable
Primitive group record data object declared within program inherently memory allocated within program space address data item typically single memory word
In program source code data item used like variable content implicitly accessed indirectly pointer
Memory space data object typically using external statement via embedded extended language construct statement
Extended version COBOL also provide pointer variable declared clause
The value pointer variable established modified using statement
Some extended version COBOL also provide variable capable storing
The language provides full support pointer data type including pointer structure string handling extensive
quite leap forward compared programming language time
The derivative C fully support C pointer C typecasting
The employ value reference semantics without pointer arithmetic
Nevertheless pointer class provided
They offer pointer arithmetic typecasting explicit memory management interfacing software feature
introduced strongly typed pointer capability
Fortran pointer contain simple memory address
They also encapsulate lower upper bound array dimension stride example support arbitrary array section metadata
An used associate variable attribute
The statement may also used associate pointer block memory
For example following code might used define create linked list structure add support procedure pointer
Also part feature support intrinsic function converting pointer Fortran pointer back
pointer
Its declaration syntax equivalent C written way around ending type
Unlike C Go garbage collection disallows pointer arithmetic
Reference type like exist
Some type like map channel boxed
internally pointer mutable structure initialized using function
In approach unified syntax pointer arrow operator dropped dot operator pointer refers field method dereferenced object
This however work level indirection
Unlike explicit representation pointer
Instead complex data structure like implemented using
The language provide explicit pointer manipulation operator
It still possible code attempt dereference null reference null pointer however result thrown
The space occupied unreferenced memory object recovered automatically
Pointers implemented much Pascal parameter procedure call
even strongly typed Pascal fewer way escape type system
Some variant include garbage collection
Much pointer available
There still fewer way evade type system variant still safer respect pointer variant
As garbage collection part language specification
Unlike many language feature pointer standard allows pointer reference dynamically created variable anonymous allow reference standard static local variable
It pointer arithmetic
Pointers also must associated type pointer one type compatible pointer another type
pointer char compatible pointer integer
This help eliminate type security issue inherent pointer implementation particularly used
It also remove risk caused ability dynamically let go referenced space using standard procedure effect library function found mean risk dangling pointer entirely eliminated
However commercial open source Pascal derivative compiler implementation pointer allowed reference standard static local variable cast one pointer type another
Moreover pointer arithmetic unrestricted adding subtracting pointer move number byte either direction using standard procedure move pointer size point
An untyped pointer also provided name compatible pointer type
The support pointer although rarely used form pack unpack function
These intended simple interaction compiled OS library
In case Perl us typed allow form pointer arithmetic
They used construct complex data structure

I ca understand fixed point floating point number due hard read definition Google
But none I read provide simple enough explanation really
Can I get plain definition example
A fixed point number specific number bit digit reserved integer part part left decimal point specific number bit reserved fractional part part right decimal point
No matter large small number always use number bit portion
For example fixed point format decimal largest number could represent would smallest would
Every bit code process number knowledge decimal point
A floating point number reserve specific number bit integer part fractional part
Instead reserve certain number bit number called certain number bit say within number decimal place sits called
So floating point number took digit digit reserved exponent might represent largest value smallest value
A fixed point number mean fixed number digit decimal point
A floating point number allows varying number digit decimal point
For example way storing number requires exactly four digit decimal point fixed point
Without restriction floating point
Often fixed point used programmer actually us integer make assumption digit beyond decimal point
For example I might want keep two digit precision value mean actually mean mean mean etc
Floating point number general purpose represent small large number way small penalty extra storage decimal place go
The term refers corresponding manner number represented fixed number digit sometimes decimal point
With representation placement decimal point relative significant digit number
For example representation uniform decimal point placement convention represent number etc whereas representation could addition represent etc
From understanding arithmetic done using integer
decimal part stored fixed amount bit number multiplied many digit decimal precision needed
For example If number need stored need two digit precision decimal point number multiplied get
When performing math number use rule set
Adding number would yield data
If want calculate decimal part number use modulo operand
pseudocode Floating point number completely different story programming
The current standard floating point number use something like bit data number bit exponent sign
Take number Floating point let represent every number great deal precision
Fixed le precise simpler By posting answer agree

A real number number contain fractional part
The following number The last example shorthand
It mean negative power multiplied
In essence computer machine capable representing real number using complex code
The popular code representing real number called
The term derived fact fixed number digit decimal point decimal point float
There also representation number digit decimal point set called representation
In general representation slower le accurate representation handle larger range number
Note number computer represent approximation
One challenge value ensuring approximation lead reasonable result
If careful small discrepancy approximation snowball point final result become meaningless
Because mathematics number requires great deal computing power many come called specialized performing arithmetic

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

In computing computer system
Virtual machine based provide functionality physical computer
Their implementation may involve specialized hardware software combination
There different kind virtual machine different function Some virtual machine designed also emulate different architecture allow execution software application operating system written another architecture
allows resource computer partitioned via support multiple isolated instance usually called may look feel like real machine
A VM originally defined efficient isolated duplicate real computer machine
Current use includes virtual machine direct correspondence real hardware
The desire run multiple operating system initial motive virtual machine allow among several operating system
In respect system virtual machine considered generalization concept historically preceded
IBM first system allow implemented providing user operating system CMS
Unlike virtual memory system virtual machine entitled user write privileged instruction code
This approach certain advantage adding device allowed standard system
As technology evolves virtual memory purpose virtualization new system may applied manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machine one computer operating system
It may possible share identical content among multiple virtual machine run physical machine may result mapping physical page technique termed
This especially useful page holding code segment case multiple virtual machine running similar software software library web server middleware component etc
The guest operating system need compliant host hardware thus making possible run different operating system computer prior version operating system support future software
The use virtual machine support separate guest operating system popular regard
A typical use would run simultaneously preferred complex operating system Linux Windows
Another use would novel unproven software still developmental stage run inside
Virtual machine advantage operating system development may include improved debugging access faster reboots
Multiple VMs running guest operating system frequently engaged server consolidation
A process VM sometimes called MRE run normal application inside host OS support single process
It created process started destroyed exit
Its purpose provide programming environment abstract away detail underlying hardware operating system allows program execute way platform
A process VM provides abstraction compared ISA abstraction system VM
Process VMs implemented using performance comparable compiled programming language achieved use
This type VM become popular implemented using
Other example include run VM called
All serve computer language
A special case process VMs system abstract communication mechanism potentially heterogeneous
Such VM consist single process one process per physical machine cluster
They designed ease task programming concurrent application letting programmer focus algorithm rather communication mechanism provided interconnect OS
They hide fact communication take place attempt present cluster single machine
Unlike process VMs system provide specific programming language embedded existing language typically system provides binding several language
Examples PVM MPI
They strictly virtual machine application running top still access OS service therefore confined system model
Both system virtual machine process virtual machine date continue area active development
grew notably implemented CTSS
allowed multiple user use computer program appeared full access machine one program executed time system switching program time slice saving restoring state time
This evolved virtual machine notably via IBM research system used used early example
The first widely available virtual machine architecture see detail
An important distinction using multiple virtual machine one host system using one virtual machine host system prototyping SIMMON
hardware emulation earlier system compatibility date back software emulation simulation predates
arose originally abstract platform used program early example date around
An early example virtual machine executes object code emitted compiler
This abstraction allowed compiler easily ported new architecture implementing new took existing compiled machine code underlying physical machine
The language used similar design intermediate language named portable
This popularized around notably system compiler termed resulting machine
This influential virtual machine sense often generally called machine
In addition intermediate language Pascal also executed directly interpreter implementing virtual machine notably influenced later interpreter notably JVM
Another early example written SNOBOL Implementation Language SIL assembly language virtual machine targeted physical machine transpiling native assembler via
Macros since fallen favor however approach le influential
Process virtual machine popular approach implementing early microcomputer software including adventure game implementation engine like argues possibly portable virtual machine ever created
Significant advance occurred implementation particularly implementation pushed forward implementation approach us process virtual machine
Later notable Smalltalk VMs
A related language produced lot virtual machine innovation programming language pioneered
These technique proved commercially successful Java virtual machine
Other innovation include virtual machine better match underlying hardware rather virtual machine closer match programming language pioneered language
In full virtualization virtual machine simulates enough hardware allow unmodified guest OS one designed run isolation
This approach pioneered IBM predecessor family
Examples outside mainframe field include discontinued formerly called GSX Server vBlade technology
In virtualization hardware provides architectural support facilitates building virtual machine monitor allows guest OSes run isolation
virtualization first introduced IBM use first virtual machine operating system
In provided additional hardware support virtualization
Sun Microsystems added similar feature processor
Examples virtualization platform adapted hardware include
In hardware support found rarely offer performance advantage software virtualization
In virtualization physical server virtualized operating system level enabling multiple isolated secure virtualized server run single physical server
The guest operating system environment share running instance operating system host system
Thus also used implement guest environment application running given guest environment view system
The pioneer implementation example include AIX Parallels Virtuozzo Containers

Using virtualization enterprise better manage update rapid change operating system application without disrupting user
Ultimately virtualization dramatically improves efficiency availability resource application organization
Instead relying old model one server one application lead underutilized resource virtual resource dynamically applied meet business need without excess fat ConsonusTech
Hardware virtualization
In hardware emulation piece hardware imitates another hardware virtualization hypervisor piece software imitates particular piece computer hardware entire computer
Furthermore computer program imitate hardware domain use language differs
A state virtual machine generally storage device exact point time
A snapshot enables virtual machine state time snapshot restored later effectively undoing change occurred afterwards
This capability useful technique example prior performing risky operation
Virtual machine frequently use storage simple example simulated
Any request VM location physical disk transparently translated operation corresponding file
Once translation layer present however possible intercept operation send different file depending various criterion
Every time snapshot taken new file created used overlay predecessor
New data written topmost overlay reading existing data however need overlay hierarchy scanned resulting accessing recent version
Thus entire stack snapshot virtually single coherent disk sense creating snapshot work similarly technique
Other component virtual machine also included snapshot content RAM setting configuration
feature example snapshot
Restoring snapshot consists discarding disregarding overlay layer added snapshot directing new change new overlay
The snapshot described moved another host machine hypervisor VM temporarily stopped snapshotted moved resumed new host known migration
If older snapshot kept sync regularly operation quite fast allow VM provide uninterrupted service prior physical host example taken physical maintenance
Similarly migration mechanism described failover allows VM continue operation host fails
However case VM continues operation coherent state rather state based whatever material backup server last provided
A video game console emulator program allows emulate different video game console behavior
Video game console emulator perform hardware virtualization word like virtualization virtual machine host guest used conjunction console emulator
Virtual machine running proprietary operating system require licensing regardless host machine operating system
For example installing VM guest requires licensing requirement satisfied
Desktop virtualization concept separating physical machine
One form desktop virtualization virtual desktop infrastructure VDI thought advanced form hardware virtualization
Rather interacting host computer directly via keyboard mouse monitor user interacts host computer using another desktop computer mobile device mean network connection even
In addition host computer scenario becomes capable hosting multiple virtual machine time multiple user
As organization continue virtualize converge data center environment architecture also continue evolve order take advantage predictability continuity quality service delivered
For example company like provide hybrid VDI model range virtualization software delivery model improve upon limitation
Selected client environment move workload PCs device data center server creating virtual client application client operating environment hosted server storage data center
For user mean access desktop location without tied single client device
Since resource centralized user moving work location still access client environment application data
For IT administrator mean centralized efficient client environment easier maintain able quickly respond changing need user business
Another form session virtualization allows multiple user connect shared powerful computer network use simultaneously
Each given desktop personal folder store file
With session virtualization accomplished using single PC multiple monitor keyboard mouse connected
seen desktop virtualization simple cheap computer primarily designed connect network
They may lack significant even many organization beginning look cost benefit eliminating thick client desktop packed software require software licensing fee making strategic investment
Desktop virtualization simplifies software versioning patch management new image simply updated server desktop get updated version reboots
It also enables centralized control application user allowed access workstation
Moving virtualized desktop cloud creates hosted virtual desktop HVDs desktop image centrally managed maintained specialist hosting firm
Benefits include scalability reduction capital expenditure replaced monthly operational cost
refers ability running within another general concept extendable arbitrary depth
In word nested virtualization refers running one inside another hypervisor
Nature nested guest virtual machine need homogeneous host virtual machine example deployed within virtual machine created using
Nested virtualization becomes necessary widespread operating system gain hypervisor functionality virtualized environment used surrounding hypervisor support nested virtualization example capable running application inside virtual machine
Furthermore moving already existing virtualized environment cloud following IaaS approach much complicated destination IaaS platform support nested virtualization
The way nested virtualization implemented particular depends supported capability
If particular architecture provide hardware support required nested virtualization various software technique employed enable
Over time architecture gain required hardware support example since microarchitecture announced Intel started include technology accelerates nested virtualization

The general step follow UNIX system follows
Each variety UNIX tends type firewall software include command line interface graphical interface
Many version Linux encourage configure one install operating system good idea
At least one firewall ipf available variety different version UNIX allows relatively consistent firewall configuration across multiple variety UNIX
Some version UNIX may still install account used demonstration purpose password default
This tends common IRIX system exists file checked immediately installation verify account demo guest exist least password assigned
Systems also may still default password changed immediately upon installation system hold true device switch router etc
well host
If system ask assign password particular account account appears password probably good idea change password account
Finally service process UNIX system generally run via one two method

Virtualization technology also expands capability hardware help control cost help improve system reliability security
For part cloud computing entail able access virtual machine able need anywhere
A hypervisor manages virtual machine
A hypervisor program would enable host several different virtual machine single hardware
Each one virtual machine operating system able run program appear system host hardware processor memory resource
In reality however actually hypervisor allocating resource virtual machine
In effect hypervisor allows several virtual machine working optimally single piece computer hardware
You may think hypervisor fairly recent phenomenon
The first hypervisors introduced allow different operating system single mainframe computer
However current popularity largely due Linux Unix
Linux Unix system started using virtualization technology expand hardware capability control cost improved reliability security hypervisors provided system
Now hypervisors fundamental component virtualization effort
You think operating system virtualized system
It access physical device residing server
It also access memory disk
It control aspect part virtual machine
The server would need execute hypervisor
The hypervisor turn load client operating system virtual machine
The hypervisor allocates correct CPU resource memory bandwidth disk storage space virtual machine
A virtual machine create request hypervisor variety method including API call
There This hypervisors run host hardware control well manage virtual machine
If currently using Microsoft hypervisor VMware Oracle VM Server KVM Citrix XenServer type hypervisor working
These hypervisors run software using operating system Windows Linux FreeBSD
This Virtage hypervisor VirtualBox VMWare Workstation classified
So native hypervisors run directly hardware hosted hypervisor need operating system work
Which one better
It depends
Bare metal hypervisors faster efficient need go operating system layer usually make hosted hypervisors slower
Type I hypervisors also secure type II hypervisors
Hosted hypervisors hand much easier set bare metal hypervisors OS work
These also compatible broad range hardware
What us hypervisors applied
Hypervisors may used data service easy cloning replication
replication also cost effective le complex current replication method especially involving virtual machine
Traditionally difficult replicate virtual machine
For one would need know manage data replication
If use storage replication method need replicate entire volume virtual machine
If lot virtual machine running particular hardware get significant amount storage order able store entire volume
With replication choose VMs part replicated could save storage space
replication also hardware neutral meaning could store data duplicate storage device
If currently using VMWare get replication vSphere
Microsoft also included feature Windows package Hypervisors graphical dashboard could work
They also download enhancement
This capability let easily consolidate server even operating system
You use hypervisor easily host virtual desktop server
This virtual desktop exact replica user physical desktop
This allow employee able work remotely matter since access PCs Internet slim client
Now come important question whether hypervisors make cloud computing secure
A hypervisor natural target hacker designed control resource hardware managing virtual machine residing
The bad news hypervisor vulnerable lot malicious code especially coming rogue virtual machine
Gartner distinguished analyst writes vulnerability found server virtualization related hypervisor
There lot type attack happening rarely highly publicized
MacDonald however suggests treat hypervisor sensitive OS data center network
You know vulnerability exist make sure manage well configuration make sure secure
provider Microsoft VMware also working make hypervisors secure
The demand secure APIs careful planning network help mitigate risk
It also help follow industry guideline best practice

A also known one several description
It class
A Petri net directed node represent transition
event may occur represented bar place
condition represented circle
The directed arc describe place postconditions transition signified arrow
Some source state Petri net invented August age purpose describing chemical process
Like industry standard Petri net offer stepwise process include choice
Unlike standard Petri net exact mathematical definition execution semantics mathematical theory process analysis
A Petri net consists
Arcs run place transition vice versa never place transition
The place arc run transition called transition place arc run transition called transition
Graphically place Petri net may contain discrete number mark called
Any distribution token place represent configuration net called
In abstract sense relating Petri net diagram transition Petri net may
sufficient token input place transition fire consumes required input token creates token output place
A firing atomic
single step
Unless defined execution Petri net multiple transition enabled time one may fire
Since firing nondeterministic multiple token may present anywhere net even place Petri net well suited modeling behavior distributed system
Petri net extend class net called elementary net
A Given net set
An net form A net form extends elementary net If Petri net equivalent elementary net countable set element map form configuration
Similarly Petri net elementary net interpreted representing set configuration
In respect extends concept configuration elementary net Petri net
In diagram Petri net see top figure right place conventionally depicted circle transition long narrow rectangle arc arrow show connection place transition transition place
If diagram elementary net place configuration would conventionally depicted circle circle encompasses single dot called
In given diagram Petri net see right place circle may encompass one token show number time place appears configuration
The configuration token distributed entire Petri net diagram called
In top figure see right place input place transition whereas place output place transition
Let Fig
top Petri net marking configured Fig
bottom Petri net marking configured
The configuration transition property input place sufficient number token shown figure dot equal greater multiplicity respective arc
Once transition enabled transition fire
In example transition generates map marking configured image result Petri net seen bottom figure
In diagram firing rule transition characterised subtracting number token input place equal multiplicity respective input arc accumulating new number token output place equal multiplicity respective output arc
The precise meaning equal greater depend precise algebraic property addition applied firing rule subtle variation algebraic property lead class Petri net example Algebraic Petri net
The following formal definition loosely based
Many alternative definition exist
A called see The set arc
In many textbook arc multiplicity
These text often define Petri net using instead
When using convention Petri net graph node partition
The transition set set
Definitions postsets place analogous
A Petri net graph multiset place mapping
We say marking assigns place number
A called see In word We generally interested may happen transition may continually fire arbitrary order
We say marking marking say reachable step
For marked Petri net interested firing performed starting initial marking
Its set set The transition relation restricted reachable marking
It net
A Petri net graph initial marking sequence transition
The set firing sequence denoted
As already remarked common variation disallow arc multiplicity replace arc simple set called
This limit represent
Another common variation
Desel Juhás allow defined place
This discussed
The marking Petri net regarded nonnegative integer length
Its transition relation described pair Then difference used describe reachable marking term matrix multiplication follows
For sequence transition write vector map every transition number occurrence
Then Note must required firing sequence allowing arbitrary sequence transition generally produce larger set
One thing make Petri net interesting provide balance modeling power analyzability many thing one would like know concurrent system automatically determined Petri net although thing expensive determine general case
Several subclass Petri net studied still model interesting class concurrent system problem become easier
An overview decidability complexity result Petri net subclass found Esparza Nielsen
The Petri net decide given Petri net marking whether
Clearly matter walking reachability graph defined either reach requested marking know longer found
This harder may seem first reachability graph generally infinite easy determine safe stop
In fact problem shown year shown decidable Mayr
Papers continue published efficiently
While reachability seems good tool find erroneous state practical problem constructed graph usually far many state calculate
To alleviate problem usually used conjunction prove state reached
LTL us find indeed state reached finding set necessary condition state reached proving condition satisfied
Petri net described different degree liveness
A Petri net called transition transition Note increasingly stringent requirement implies
These definition accordance Murata overview additionally us term
A place Petri net called contain token reachable marking including initial marking said
A marked Petri net called place
A Petri net graph called bounded every possible initial marking
Note Petri net bounded reachability graph finite
Boundedness decidable looking constructing Tree
It useful explicitly impose bound place given net
This used model limited system resource
Some definition Petri net explicitly allow syntactic feature
Formally defined tuples Petri net assignment capacity place transition relation usual one restricted marking place capacity many token
For example net place assigned capacity obtain Petri net place capacity say reachability graph displayed right
Alternatively place made bounded extending net
To exact place made adding flow opposite place adding token make total place
As well discrete event Petri net continuous hybrid process useful discrete continuous hybrid related discrete continuous hybrid
There many extension Petri net
Some completely
original Petri net add property modelled original Petri net formalism
timed Petri net
Although model extend computational power Petri net may succinct representation may convenient modeling
Extensions transformed Petri net sometimes powerful usually lack full range mathematical tool available analyse ordinary Petri net
The term used many Petri net formalism extend basic net formalism includes coloured Petri net hierarchical Petri net extension sketched section
The term also used specifically type coloured net supported
A short list possible extension There many extension Petri net however important keep mind complexity net increase term extended property harder use standard tool evaluate certain property net
For reason good idea use simple net type possible given modelling task
Instead extending Petri net formalism also look restricting look particular type Petri net obtained restricting syntax particular way
Ordinary Petri net net arc weight
Restricting following type ordinary Petri net commonly used studied subclass Petri net intending model process activity
The transition assigned task activity place assigned condition
The additional structural operational requirement mainly addition single input source place previous transition output place sink following transition
Accordingly start termination marking defined represent process status
property indicating process start marking k token source place reach termination state marking k token sink place defined
Additionally transition process could fire transition reachable state transition enabled
A general sound defined every k
A directed Petri net defined sequence node place transition linked directed arc
An includes every node sequence
A Petri net net fully distinct elementary path place transition transition place two path pair node path share node
An acyclic sound
Extended Petri net composed additional transition feedback transition
The sink place connected input place transition source place output place
Firing transition cause iteration process Note extended
WRI Regular Iteration extended acyclic
built composition net replacing transition within subnet
The result also
therefore using building block one get construction
The DSM model process relation utilized process planning
The realization plan workflow process Petri net equivalent
The construction process ensures soundness property resulting net
Other way modelling concurrent computation proposed including
Different model provide tradeoff concept locality
An approach relating model concurrency proposed chapter Winskel Nielsen

I want ask petri net PN boundedness
When I state find state since I declare PN NOT bounded
Because I PN PN bounded u find
So question
Am I wrong boundedness petri net something wrong PT picture
Unboundedness studied fixed initial marking
Then want find state reachable firing transition larger initial one
You mention state picture
The problem I see either one reached
So start initial state analyse transition fired
For given Petri Net number token represented respectively
Based definition boundedness Petri Net given Petri Net bounded
In word natural number case number token never exceeds number
I also providing example unbounded Petri Net example bounded Petri Net
Regardless initial marking Petri Net Figure bounded unbounded keep firing
For given initial marking Petri Net Figure bounded
In general Petri Net Figure bounded let initial value initial value

Let V E directed graph
We define v V nearly root path v least vertex
How find set nearly root linear time
What tried build strongly connected graph scc obtained G topological sort
Now went backwards scc count many vertex reach scanning outgoing edge summing vertex reachable successor
This seems wrong since may count vertex
The following algorithm solve problem The task decomposed subtasks Perform DFS G
It used tool identify contract cycle keeping tab number contracted node
For cycle contraction suffices detect backward edge node entering node first time leaving last time
Each time backward edge w v detected node current DFS path p v w coalesced new node v edge node p retained
These modification done situ x x p v x x p v p contraction starting E V
Mark node attribute containing number node V represents
initialising attribute adding cycle length subtracted contraction
case contracted node also record represented node adding stack attribute
The resulting graph G particular irreflexive
Next perform BFS G
Propagate attribute V N along way locally computes reachable v represents v w pred v V reachable w denoting set predecessor initialised maximal element G
node v G reachable v mark represented node original graph G nearly root

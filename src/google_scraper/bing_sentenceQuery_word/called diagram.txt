Learn essential Venn Diagrams along long history versatile purpose us example symbol step draw
A Venn Diagram us overlapping circle shape illustrate logical relationship two set item
Often serve graphically organize thing highlighting item similar different
Venn Diagrams also called Set Diagrams Logic Diagrams widely used mathematics statistic logic teaching linguistics computer science business
Many people first encounter school study math logic since Venn Diagrams became part new math curriculum
These may simple diagram involving two three set element may become quite sophisticated including presentation progress six seven set beyond
They used think depict item relate within particular universe segment
Venn Diagrams allow user visualize data clear powerful way therefore commonly used presentation report
They closely related Euler Diagrams differ omitting set item exist
Venn Diagrams show relationship even set empty
Venn Diagrams named British logician John Venn
He wrote paper entitled On Diagrammatic Mechanical Representation Propositions Reasonings Philosophical Magazine Journal Science
But root type diagram go back much least year
In philosopher logician Ramon Llull sometimes spelled Lull Majorca used similar type diagram wrote author
Baron article tracing history
She also credited German mathematician philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibnitz drawing similar diagram late
In Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler pronounced invented came known Euler Diagram direct forerunner Venn Diagram
In fact John Venn referred diagram Eulerian Circles Venn Diagrams
The term Venn Diagrams first published American philosopher Clarence Irving
Lewis book A Survey Symbolic Logic
Venn Diagrams continued evolve past year advance expert David Henderson Peter Hamburger Jerrold Griggs Charles Chip Killian Carla Savage
Their work concerned symmetric Venn Diagrams relationship prime number number indivisible number except number

A symbolic according technique
Diagrams used since ancient time became prevalent
Sometimes technique us visualization onto surface
The word sometimes used diagram
The term diagram commonly used sense general specific meaning In science term used way
For example Anderson stated generally diagram pictorial yet abstract representation information example diagram whereas photograph video
On hand Lowe defined diagram specifically abstract graphic portrayal subject matter represent
In specific sense diagram chart contrast technical illustration map showing abstract rather representation information
The essence diagram seen Or Hall word diagram simplified figure caricature way intended convey essential meaning
These simplified figure often based set rule
The basic shape according White characterized term elegance clarity ease pattern simplicity validity
Elegance basically determined whether diagram simplest fitting solution problem
There least following type diagram type diagram Many type diagram commonly generated using diagramming software
Thousands diagram technique exist
Some example follow
Diagrams may also classified according use purpose example explanatory diagram

A way modelling domain level detail much domain model
Inside design class diagram class become object Objects created according Object Class Definition
An Object Class definition type template creating object
It includes declaration attribute operation associated object class
In UML object class represented section object attribute object operation
An example shown using object class model If one thing Object Oriented way top section would declaration variable bottom section
Now going get bog fast warning hehe
Now part need read An exam contains different type question Using draw Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain
First thing first need identify Classes
Well quite obviously Classes straight top BUT look see
Well saw inherit something right inherit Question think one contain something variable operation etc etc really want write declaration time
But Multiple Choice question
They contain multiple answer surely need type could use Multiple Choice Question Options That mean class
So quick guidance Domain Model look like Here
Aside
I realised missed something im sooo sorry So yeah extra feature inside Design Class Diagram besides bleeding These extra feature forgot mention I think either leave comment email uni come bother hahaha OK go
Using Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain Model
This look good take look

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

Venn diagram going nickname primary diagram set diagram logic diagram widely known
This kind diagram show possible logical relation finite collection different set
These diagram depict element point plane well set region inside closed curve
A Venn diagram consists multiple overlapping closed curve usually represented circle represents set
The point inside curve labeled S represent element set S point outside boundary represent element set S
In Venn diagram curve overlapped different way showing possible relation existing set

Venn diagram Euler diagram incorporated part instruction set theory part new math movement
Since also adopted curriculum field
A Venn diagram built using collection simple closed curve plane
The principle diagram class also known set represented region relation one another possible logical relation class set indicated diagram
That diagram initially leaf room possible relation class
The actual given relation within diagram specified indicating particular region null
Venn diagram normally comprise overlapping circle
The inner part circle aid symbol represents element set
The exterior though implies element included set
For example Venn diagram one circle may represent group object made wood another circle may represent set table
The overlapping region would represent set wooden table
Any shape circle employed shown Venn higher set diagram
Venn diagram contain information relative absolute size set similar Euler diagram mentioned
However Venn diagram n component set must contain hypothetically possible zone correspond combination inclusion exclusion component set
The difference Euler diagram Venn diagram Euler diagram contain actually possible zone given context
In Venn diagram though shaded zone may represent empty zone
At time Euler diagram corresponding zone missing diagram
As example imagine one set representing dairy product another one cheese
In case Venn diagram contains zone cheese dairy product

All u engage make use valid reasoning reasoning actually perform differs various way inference studied formal logician
Reasoning performed human being typically involves information obtained one medium
Formal logic contrast thus far primarily concerned valid reasoning based information one form form sentence
Recently many philosopher psychologist logician mathematician computer scientist become increasingly aware importance reasoning moreover much research undertaken area especially diagrammatic representation system
This entry outline overall direction new research area focus logical status diagram proof representational function adequacy different kind diagrammatic system role diagram human cognition
Diagrams picture probably rank among oldest form human communication
They used representation also used carry certain type reasoning hence play particular role logic mathematics
However sentential representation system logic dominant modern history logic diagram largely seen marginal interest
Diagrams usually adopted heuristic tool exploring proof part proof
It quite recent movement among philosopher logician cognitive scientist computer scientist focus different type representation system much research focussed diagrammatic representation system particular
Challenging prejudice diagrammatic representation working reasoning taken different kind approach may categorize three distinct group
One branch research found philosophy mind cognitive science
Since limit linguistic form clear working mental representation reasoning philosopher cognitive scientist embraced new direction reasoning enthusiasm explored human reasoning mental representation involving form Cummins Chandrasekaran et al

Another strand work diagrammatic reasoning show intrinsic difference symbolic diagrammatic system far logical status go
Some logician presented case study prove diagrammatic system sound complete sense symbolic system
This type result directly refuted assumption diagram inherently misleading abolished theoretical objection diagram used proof Shin Hammer
A third direction reasoning taken computer scientist whose interest much practical group
Not surprisingly working many area computer example knowledge representation system design visual programming GUI design new exciting opportunity new concept heterogeneous system implemented diagrammatic representation research area
We following goal entry
First would like acquaint reader detail specific diagrammatic system
At time entry address theoretical issue exploring nature diagrammatic representation reasoning term expressive power correctness
The case study second section satisfy first goal also provide u solid material theoretical general discussion third section
The fourth section present another case study considers light third section general discussion
As mentioned topic diagram attracted much attention important result many different research area
Hence fifth section aim introduce various approach diagrammatic reasoning taken different area
For discussion need clarify two related distinct us word diagram diagram internal mental representation diagram external representation
The following quotation Chandrasekaran et al
xvii succinctly sum distinction internal versus external diagrammatic representation As see logician focus external diagrammatic system imagery debate among philosopher mind cognitive scientist mainly internal diagram research cognitive role diagram touch form
The dominance sentential representation system history modern logic obscured several important fact diagrammatic system
One several diagrammatic system available heuristic tool era modern logic
Euler circle Venn diagram Lewis Carroll square widely used certain type syllogistic reasoning Euler Venn Carroll
Another interesting neglected story founder modern symbolic logic Charles Peirce revised Venn diagram also invented graphical system Existential Graphs proven equivalent predicate language Peirce Roberts Zeman
These existing diagram inspired researcher recently drawn attention representation
Logicians participate project explored subject two distinct way
First interest focused exclusively representation system opposed internal mental representation
Second aim establish logical status system rather explain heuristic power testing correctness expressive power selective representation system
If system fails justify soundness expressive power limited logician interest language fade Sowa Shin
In section examine historical development Euler Venn diagram case study illustrate following aspect First process show u one mathematician simple intuition diagramming syllogistic reasoning gradually developed formal representation system
Second observe different emphasis given different stage extension modification diagrammatic system
Thirdly relatedly historical development illustrates interesting tension expressive power visual clarity diagrammatic system
Most importantly reader witness logician tackle issue whether intrinsic reason sentential system diagrammatic system could provide u rigorous proof success answering question negative
Hence reader surprised following conclusion drawn Barwise Etchemendy first logician launch inquiry diagrammatic proof logic This conviction necessary birth innovative computer program adopts language diagram system teach elementary logic course Barwise Etchemendy
Leonhard Euler century mathematician adopted closed curve illustrate syllogistic reasoning Euler
The four kind categorical sentence represented shown Figure
For two universal statement system adopts spatial relation among circle intuitive way If circle labelled circle labelled diagram represents information
If part two circle diagram conveys information
This representation governed following convention The power representation lie fact object member set easily conceptualized object falling inside set location page thought falling inside outside drawn circle
The system power also lie fact additional convention needed establish meaning diagram involving one circle relationship holding among set asserted mean relationship holding among circle representing
The representation two universal statement All No illustrate strength system
Moving two existential statement clarity preserved
Euler justifies diagram Some saying infer something also contained since part area contained area Euler
Obviously Euler believed kind visual containment relation among area used case well case universal statement
However Euler belief correct representation raise damaging ambiguity
In diagram part circle contained area Euler describes following true part circle contained area ii part circle contained circle iii part circle contained circle
That third diagram could read Some Some Some well Some In order avoid ambiguity need set several convention
Euler example nicely illustrate strength weakness diagrammatic system

No
All
Therefore
In example reader easily infer conclusion illustrates visually powerful feature Euler diagram
However existential statement represented thing become complicated explained
For instance
No
Some
Therefore Some
No single diagram represent two premise since relationship set fully specified one single diagram
Instead Euler suggests following three possible case Euler claim proposition Some read diagram
However far visually clear first two case lead user reading proposition since user might read No case All case
Hence representation existential statement obscures visual clarity Euler Circles also raise serious interpretational problem system
Euler seemed recognize potential problem introduced new syntactic device representing attempt repair flaw Letter
However serious drawback found system fails represent certain compatible consistent piece information single diagram
For example Euler system prevents u drawing single diagram representing following pair statement All No consistent empty set
ii All All consistent
iii Some All
Suppose drew Euler diagram former proposition try add new compatible piece information latter existing diagram
This shortcoming closely related Venn motivation diagrammatic system see shortcoming system
Venn criticism Euler Circles summarized following passage Because strictness Euler system sometimes fails representing consistent piece information single diagram shown
In addition expressive limitation Euler system also suffers kind expressive limitation respect set due topological restriction plane figure see
Venn new system overcome expressive limitation partial information represented
The solution idea primary diagram
A primary diagram represents possible relation number set without making existential commitment
For example Figure show primary diagram set
According Venn system diagram convey specific information relation two set
This major difference Euler Venn diagram
For representation universal statement unlike visually clear spatial containment relation case Euler diagram Venn solution shade appropriate area Venn
By using syntactic device obtain diagram universal statement shown Figure
Venn choice shading might absolutely arbitrary shading could interpreted visualization set emptiness
However noted shading new syntactic device Euler use
This revision gave flexibility system certain compatible piece information may represented single diagram
In following diagram left combine two piece information All No visually convey information Nothing The diagram representing All All clearly show In fact using primary diagram also avoids expressivity problem spatial property diagram object discussed
Surprisingly Venn silent representation existential statement another difficulty Euler diagram
We imagine Venn might introduced another kind syntactic object representing existential commitment
This Charles Peirce twenty year later
Peirce point Venn system way representing following kind information existential statement disjunctive information probability relation
Peirce aimed extend Venn system expressive power respect first two kind proposition existential disjunctive statement
This extension completed mean following three device
Replace Venn shading representing emptiness new symbol
ii Introduce symbol x existential import
iii For disjunctive information introduce linear symbol connects x symbol
For example Figure represents statement All neither Euler Venn system represent single diagram
The reason Peirce replaced Venn shading emptiness symbol seems obvious It would easy connect shading shading x order represent disjunctive information
In way Peirce increased expressive power system change without cost
For example following diagram represents proposition Reading diagram requires reading visual containment among circle Euler diagram shading Venn diagram also requires extra convention reading combination symbol x line
Peirce new convention increased expressive power single diagram arbitrariness convention confusing representation example diagram sacrificed visual clarity Euler original system enjoys
At point Peirce confesses great complexity expression essential meaning Peirce
Thus Peirce revision completed Euler original idea visualization lost except geometrical object circle used represent possibly empty set
Another important contribution Peirce made study diagram start following remark Peirce probably first person discus rule transformation representation system
In way rule algebra tell u transformation symbol permitted rule diagram manipulation
Some Pierce six rule needed clarification turn problem Peirce anticipated
However importantly Peirce theoretical clear distinction syntax convince reader rule correct determine whether rule needed
That important intuition could transformation rule diagram remained justified
Shin follows Peirce work two direction
One improve Peirce version Venn diagram prove soundness completeness revised system
Shin work alters Peirce modification Venn diagram achieve increase expressive power without severe loss visual clarity
This revision made two stage retains Venn shading emptiness x existential import connecting line x disjunctive information
ii This system proven logically equivalent monadic predicate logic except connecting line diagram newly introduced display disjunctive information
Returning one Euler example see contrast among different version clearly Euler admits single Euler diagram drawn represent premise three possible case must drawn
system silent existential statement
Now Peirce system represent two premise single diagram follows In case Shin diagram Venn shading convention emptiness opposed Peirce much naturally lead reader inference Some case Peirce diagram
However express disjunctive information universal statement universal existential statement
Retaining expressive power allows diagram connected line
Peirce confusing looking diagram equivalent following diagram In addition revision Shin presented two system standard formal representation system equipped syntax semantics
The syntax tell u diagram acceptable manipulation permissible system
The semantics defines logical consequence among diagram
Using tool proven system sound complete sense symbolic logic
This approach posed fundamental challenge assumption held representation system
Since development modern logic important concept syntax semantics inference logical consequence validity completeness applied sentential representation system
However none turned intrinsic traditional symbolic logic
For representation system whether sentential diagrammatic discus two level syntactic semantic level
What inference rule tell u manipulate given unit whether symbolic diagrammatic another
The definition logical consequence also free specific form representation system
The argument go soundness completeness proof
When system proven sound able adopt proof
In fact much current research explores use diagram automated theorem proving see Bailin Jamnik et al

It interesting important notice gradual change made Euler Circles Shin system share one common theme increase expressive logical power system sound complete logically equivalent monadic predicate logic
The main revision Euler Venn diagram introducing primary diagram allows u represent partial knowledge relation set
The extension Venn Peirce diagram made existential disjunctive information may represented effectively
Both Venn Peirce adopted kind solution order achieve improvement introduce new syntactic object shading Venn x line Peirce
However negative side revised system suffer loss visual clarity seen mainly introduction arbitrary convention
The modification Peirce Shin diagram concentrate restoring visual clarity without loss expressive power
Hammer Shin take different path revision To revive Euler homomorphic relation circle among circle represents subset relation among set region represents disjoint time adopt Venn primary diagram default
On hand revised Euler system tool syllogistic reasoning since represent existential statement
For detail revised system refer Hammer Shin
This case study raise interesting question research diagrammatic reasoning
Throughout different development Euler diagram increasing expressive power enhancing visual clarity seem complementary
Depending purpose need give priority one
Hammer Shin alternative system provides simple model development efficient representational system topic receiving increasing attention computer science cognitive science
While often possible afford diagram logical status formula argued still important difference ramification correctness system diagram traditional linear proof calculus
An important point note diagram cf
Russell spatial relation object diagram used represent relation object domain
Sequential language symbolic logic natural language however use relation concatenation represent relation object
The peculiar representational use spatial relation case diagram direct intuitive seen development Euler Diagrams also shall discus
Spatial constraint peculiar diagrammatic system expected important source strength weakness
Psychological consideration concerning human capacity visual processing information skill qualitative spatial reasoning also ramification effectiveness reasoning diagram shall survey
A particular distinguishing feature diagram obey certain nomic intrinsic constraint due use plane surface medium representation
The idea sentential language based acoustic signal sequential nature must compensatingly complex syntax order express certain diagram able display relationship without intervention complex syntax Stenning Lemon
Diagrams exploit use spatial relation represent relation
The question well spatial relation object represent possibly abstract object relation
Logical reasoning diagram often carried virtue depiction possible model situation topological equivalence diagram course depends particular diagrammatic system use
A single diagram often abstraction class situation suitable diagram constructed inference simply read representation without manipulation
In diagrammatic system Euler Circles inference carried constructing diagram correctly reading information
The complexity using inference rule symbolic logic case replaced problem drawing particular diagram correctly
For instance Euler Circles diagram venture capture relationship set using topological relationship plane region way depicts possible way certain collection statement could true
This two important consequence certain diagram drawn described situation must impossible termed certain relationship diagram object must drawn corresponding relation inferred logically valid
See numerous example
This phenomenon often termed Barwise Shimojima
This style diagrammatic reasoning thus dependent particular representational use represent class model
If particular class model represented diagrammatic system case taken account inference using system incorrect inference might drawn
This fact make representational adequacy diagrammatic system restricted spatial nature paramount importance shall explore
The representational use spatial relation plane constrains diagrammatic representation therefore reasoning diagram certain important way
In particular topological geometrical let u lump together spatial property diagrammatic object relation limit expressive power diagrammatic system
For instance graph theory known simple structure drawn plane
For example graph graph consisting node joined arc
This graph meaning drawn without least two arc crossing
This sort constraint possible diagram limit expressive power diagrammatic system
Now since diagrammatic reasoning occur enumeration possible model situation representational inadequacy type incompleteness render many diagrammatic system incorrect used logical reasoning see critique Englebretsen Lemon Pratt
Perhaps simple example due Lemon Pratt see
Consider Euler convex region plane represent set overlap region represents intersection corresponding set
A result convex topology known Helly Theorem state dimensional case every triple convex region intersection four region must intersection
To understand ramification consider following problem Note term trivial consequence follow premise
However Euler diagram premise Figure lead incorrect conclusion due quadruple overlap region centre diagram In word user Euler Circles forced represent relationship set logically necessary
This mean logically possible situation system represent user would make incorrect inference relied system reasoning
More generally type result generated many different type diagrammatic system depending particular spatial relation object use research programme ongoing
For example using region blob instead circle lead similar problem graph involved instead Helly Theorem
A similar result concern linear diagram syllogism Englebretsen line used represent set point represent individual intersection represents intersection line represents
Again planarity constraint restrict expressive power system lead incorrect inference
Atsushi Shimojima constraint hypothesis perhaps best sum As discussed much interest diagram generated claim somehow effective traditional logical representation certain type task
Certainly example map greater aid navigation verbal description landscape
However certainly psychological advantage gained use diagram case Euler Circles often ineffective representation abstract object relationship
Once purely intuitive notion claim efficacy diagrammatic system examined term standard formal property language Lemon et al

In particular many diagrammatic system incorrect incomplete complexity inference diagram
By way contrast sentential logic able express inconsistency complete correct
On hand able represent contradiction could provide u interesting insight nature diagrammatic representation
If central goal language represent world state affair representing contradiction tautology called question
Neither contradiction tautology part world
How draw picture take picture contradiction raining raining
How picture disjunctive information either raining raining
Now seem much closer Wittgenstein classic picture theory language Wittgenstein

It capacity represent property relation diagram seem capable functioning effectively symbol proof
The exact property diagram refined easily reproducible support determinate judgment
As Manders put The practice resource limit risk disagreement explicit attribution diagram lack resource exact attribution therefore could allow without dissolving disarray irresolvably conflicting judgement
Manders Manders insight lead naturally idea Euclid argument could formalized manner similar way Venn diagram formalized Shin
The information carried Euclid diagram discrete
When diagram consulted information matter line circle partition bounded planar region finite set
This open door conceptualizing Euclid diagram part Euclid proof method
Realizing conception formal system proof amount Shin specifying syntax semantics diagram
On syntactic side mean defining Euclid diagram formal object precisely giving rule whereby diagram formal object figure derivation Euclid proposition
On semantic side mean specifying derivable expression interpreted geometrically word exactly understood representing Euclid proposition
The semantic situation Euclid diagram thus different Venn
Venn diagram used prove result
The inference made topic neutral
Euclid diagram hand used prove result
The inference made topic specific
In particular though object plane Euclidean geometry abstract geometric line breadthless still spatial
Consequently issue surrounding spatiality diagram representational scope arise Euclid diagram instance Euler diagram
In case geometry fact spatiality diagram count favor
Spatial constraint possible geometric configuration also operative spatial Euclidean diagram
Nevertheless recognized philosophical commentary Euclid geometry antiquity onward Euclidean diagram issue representational scope contend
What justification treating property single geometric diagram representative configuration range proof
How single diagram prove general result
Manders distinction provides basis partial answer
The property diagram shared geometric configuration range proof case one justified reading property diagram
In proof triangle instance variation among configuration range proof variation exact measure triangle angle ratio side
They share consists three bounded linear region together define area
This full answer Euclid proof typically involve construction initial configuration type
With proof proposition example construction triangle one side extended specified
In case diagram may adequately represent property initial configuration
But result applying construction diagram assumed represent property configuration resulting construction
One need consider complex geometric situation see
Suppose instance initial configuration type proof
Then diagram serf represent property type
Suppose first step proof construction drop perpendicular vertex triangle line containing side opposite vertex
Then result carrying step diagram cease representative
That perpendicular fall within triangle diagram feature
But triangle exact property different initial diagram applying construction step result perpendicular lying outside triangle
For example triangle result applying construction step And carrying Euclidean construction representative diagram result unrepresentative diagram
A central task formalizing Euclid diagrammatic proof accounting providing rule method distinguishing general feature one diagrammatic representation construction
The system take two different approach task
Employing method one must produce diagram case could result construction
A general relation construction one appears every case
demand every case produced would course little interest also provide method producing
The method provides depends fact line circle system diagram defined purely topological term
Their resulting flexibility make possible formulate implement computer program general method generating case
The line circle diagram similarly flexible
Accordingly resolve generality problem via
The central idea approach allow diagram hold partial information outset
Within derivation diagram produced proof construction initial content consisting qualitative relation proof initial diagram
The qualitative relation concerning object added construction read diagram immediately
Those read diagram must derived rule
The difference approach formalizing construction understood representing different general conception role diagram mathematics
embodies conception diagram concretely realize range mathematical possibility
They support mathematical inference furnishing direct access possibility
contrast embodies conception diagram serve represent single symbol various component complex mathematical situation
They support mathematical inference allowing mathematical reasoner consider component one place focus component relevant proof
Despite formal limitation diagrammatic system noted many different system currently used wide variety context logic teaching automated reasoning specifying computer program reasoning situation physic graphical user interface computer program
In general yet known effective sense many diagrammatic system
We give brief survey diagrammatic system us well philosophical issue raised debate status diagrammatic reasoning
It worth noting many mathematician philosopher proposed diagrammatic system often didactic motivation
Some system like Lewis Carroll The Game Logic variant proposal Euler Venn
Others like Frege used line rather plane region
For description Frege notation see section Complex Statements Generality entry

Carroll system supersedes Venn complement set explicitly represented region diagram rather left background region circle appear
This mean Carroll system able draw inference relation complement property expense representing property disjoint region

Do mental representation entity component
This question long history philosophy psychology independently
More recently however philosopher participated imagery debate one controversy psychology cognitive psychologist find certain epistemological theory philosophy useful support view issue
The nature mental representation one perennial topic philosophy easily trace back philosophical discussion image mental representation ancient time
The writing Hobbes Locke Berkeley Hume concern large part mental discourse meaning word mental image particular idea abstract idea impression
Descartes distinction imagining conceiving something generated much discussion unique role visual image mental representation
The development cognitive science century naturally brought certain group philosopher psychologist closer find number author whose work easily belong discipline Block Dennett Fodor
Imagery based introspection main focus early development psychology behavioristic approach became predominant discipline
During era behaviorism anything related mental inspection including image excluded serious research agenda
Finally topic mental image made comeback psychology researcher adopted humble agenda mental imagery Not mental representation involve imagery imagery one many way manipulating information mind
Also thanks influence behaviorism acknowledged introspection enough explore imagery claim mental imagery need confirmable experiment order show successfully externalize mental event
That certain mental introspection tell u genuine would observable external consequence mental state
Thus contemporary imagery debate among cognitive scientist claim image exist mental representation interpret certain experiment
Kosslyn pictorialists Shepard Metzler present experimental data support position mental image like picture linear form language example natural language artificial symbolic language important aspect even though visual mental image picture exactly kind
By contrast Pylyshyn descriptionalists Dennett raise question status mental image argue mental image formed structured description
To mental image represent manner language rather picture hence visual mental image
Both side debate sometimes used philosophical theory supporting factor
For example pictorialists imagery debate found modern theory philosophy quite close point view
By token critic theory argued mistaken pictorial view mental image arises mainly confusion ordinary language claimed mental image epiphenomenon
Without heavily involved imagery debate researcher focused distinct role diagram opposed traditional sentential cognitive activity
Based conjecture human adopt diagrammatic spatial internal mental representation reasoning concrete abstract situation see Howell Sober cognitive scientist concentrated function image diagram various cognitive activity example memory imagination perception navigation inference
Here distinct nature visual information obtained either internal mental image externally drawn diagram become major topic research
Even though work assume mental image accept pictorialists claim strictly speaking commit view image exist basic unit cognition
Descriptionalists discard discussion function image need add image primitive unit stored memory formed structured description like sentence language see Pylyshyn
A search distinct role diagram led researcher explore difference among different form external internal representation mainly diagrammatic sentential representation

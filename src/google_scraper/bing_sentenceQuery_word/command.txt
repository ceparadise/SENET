In directive computer program acting interpreter kind order perform specific task
Most commonly command either directive kind event triggered user selecting option
Specifically term used
These language called language usually written manner similar used many
If one view statement like sentence natural language command generally like verb language
Many program allow specially formatted known flag option modify default behaviour command describe command act
Comparing natural language flag adverb whilst argument
Here command given
The following command change user place current position directory
The command argument The following command print text stream case print text screen
The command argument
The quote used prevent treated separate argument The following command equivalent
They list file directory
The command argument three flag
The following command display content file
The command argument
Here command given different interpreter command prompt
Notice flag identified differently concept The following command list content current directory
The command A flag
There argument
The following command display content file
The command
The argument
P parameter

A command specific instruction given computer application perform kind task function
In Windows command usually entered via like
Commands must always entered command line interpreter exactly
Entering command incorrectly wrong misspelling etc
could cause command fail worse could execute wrong command right command wrong way creating serious problem
There many different kind command many phrase use word probably actually command
Yes kind confusing
Below popular kind command might encounter Command Prompt command true command
By true command I mean program intended run command line interface case Windows Command Prompt whose action result also produced command line interface
See complete list command detail ever want check without explanation command
DOS command correctly called command might considered purest Microsoft based command since graphical interface command life completely command line world
Do confuse DOS command Command Prompt command
Command Prompt may appear similar true operating system Command Prompt program run within Windows operating system
Both share many command certainly
See interested command available latest version Microsoft DOS
A run command simply name given executable particular program
A run command command strictest sense like shortcut
In fact shortcut live Start Menu Start Screen usually nothing icon representation executable program basically run command picture
For example run command Paint painting drawing program Windows run Run box Search box even Command Prompt Paint obviously command line program
Some example bit confusing
The run command Remote Desktop Connection example run command command line switch make opening program specific parameter easy
However Remote Desktop Connection program designed really command
See article list program executables
Another command see referenced really command Control Panel applet command
A Control Panel applet command really run command control parameter instructing Windows open specific
For example executing open Date Time applet Control Panel directly
Yes execute command Command Prompt Control Panel command line program
See complete list command
Recovery Console command also true command
Recovery Console command available within Recovery Console command line interpreter available troubleshooting problem Windows XP Windows
I also keep detail example command
There error

Sometimes directing use command window terminal compile run C program
Reasons use command line The direct way access command line often called On Windows easy access Mono tool press Windows key lower left lower right keyboard type Mono select Mono Command Prompt press Enter
Alternately general way get command window press Windows key R lower upper case together type press Enter Return key brings basic command processing program cmd
On Mac open Terminal window fine Mono SDK command
Mac OSX Linux Unix variant work basically get terminal distinguish Windows Mac
First make sure familiar
In command shell always usually shown prompt next command
When open Mono Command Prompt Terminal window see prompt tell folder directory command shell started If directly open terminal previous section Windows typically C Mac typically
Particularly window annoying folder
There several way get better location
If get parent folder folder want Windows Explorer window right clicking Start Mac Finder shortcut opening terminal current directory one one shown graphical window Files current working directory referred simple name
You list file directory simple command short directory Windows short list Mac
You need refer file current directory via relative absolute path name
After starting one folder may well want change current folder without opening new terminal window
This particularly true start Windows Mono command prompt
You see change current directory command
On Mac file system unified one hierarchy
On Windows may several drive need start path reference drive like C current drive
When run cmd start Mono command prompt Windows likely want get home directory Mac user start automatically
Windows user enter command substituting login ID get home directory The cd short Change Directory changing current directory
Warning Windows The cd command work way likely think Windows system one drive like C flash drive E plugged
Windows remembers current directory drive
It also remembers
You cd command
The command change current drive name drive colon
For example command set current drive E active directory current directory E
However current drive C enter command change current directory E
We described use Windows folder open terminal
If want change directory existing terminal also shortcut copy long folder name given Windows folder Windows On Mac easier shortcut The command shell wait type short name shell recognizes followed separated space Enter
Note parameter contains space must surround parameter value matching single double quote see example later
We going mention simplest us basic command
More advanced documentation would include option
Some command common Windows Mac shell stand use command change current working directory different one
You use command change directory C program source file located different initial directory
On Windows suppose created directory C change type press Enter shell prompt change show new directory location program like able access file directly name
If directory current directory would shorter use relative path
Remember want different Windows drive must first use
On Mac absolute relative path work
There issue drive
If included space one directory name example C space COMP enclose path quote like type press Enter change back home directory
There also shorthand name home directory command path tilde often shifted backquote keyboard
Sorry thing Windows
stand make directory use create new empty directory current directory
For example Mac current directory type press Enter create new directory exist create C source file directory enter command shell
An optional Windows abbreviation
remove directory give parameter With Mono installed Windows Mono command window program associated Mono used Other useful command different name Windows Mac listed next generic function general Windows syntax first Mac second often example order Display content text file command window
The name origin complicated use cat con enate file
Make copy file
Caution If second file already exists wipe original content
Erase remove file Another Windows equivalent short delete
We explained simplest use many command
Many modifier possible
Help command Note double dash This sometimes work concise help Mac generally get immensely detailed help overload Mac This subject course command combined script file
Scripting language fact whole new specialized programming language include many type programming statement found C
Copying pasting Mac terminal editing Use Apple Command key C P select mouse
In Windows complicated using command window You paste current command line clicking Command Window Title bar select edit paste
By default Windows command window sensitive mouse
You change sensitive select copy Right click title bar select default make sure check box edit option checked
The last two explained next section
Click Then select mouse press Enter selection remembered copy buffer
Both Mac Windows right option selected like Windows check box last section allow reduce typing You bring back previous command history command automatically remembered Use arrow
This make easy run command make slight edits
Both Windows see file directory referred
If start type file folder name press Tab key Windows complete name ambiguity
If ambiguity work differently Copyright Andrew Harrington George Thiruvathukal

In set rule defines combination symbol considered correctly structured document fragment language
This applies document represents document represents data
The syntax language defines surface form
computer language based sequence character based spatial layout connection symbol may textual graphical
Documents syntactically invalid said
Syntax form contrasted meaning
In processing computer language semantic processing generally come syntactic processing case semantic processing necessary complete syntactic analysis done together
In syntactic analysis comprises semantic analysis comprises middle end phase distinguished
Computer language syntax generally distinguished three level Distinguishing way yield modularity allowing level described processed separately often independently
First lexer turn linear sequence character linear sequence known lexing
Second parser turn linear sequence token hierarchical syntax tree known narrowly speaking
Thirdly contextual analysis resolve name check type
This modularity sometimes possible many language earlier step depends later step example C tokenization depends context
Even case syntactical analysis often seen approximating ideal model
The parsing stage divided two part concrete syntax tree determined grammar generally far detailed practical use AST simplifies usable form
The AST contextual analysis step considered form semantic analysis adding meaning interpretation syntax alternatively informal manual implementation syntactical rule would difficult awkward describe implement formally
The level generally correspond level
Words specified grammar generally given
Phrases CFL generally DCFL specified grammar generally given BNF
Phrase grammar often specified much constrained grammar full order make easier parse parse DCFL linear time simple even simpler efficient parse grammar whose production rule constrained
In principle contextual structure described automatically analyzed mean though general step done manually via rule implemented via store name type scope
Tools written automatically generate lexer lexical specification written regular expression parser phrase grammar written BNF allows one use rather need procedural functional programming
A notable example pair
These automatically produce syntax tree parser writer must manually write code describing converted syntax tree
Contextual analysis also generally implemented manually
Despite existence automatic tool parsing often implemented manually various reason perhaps phrase structure alternative implementation improves performance allows grammar changed easily
Parsers often written functional language Haskell scripting language Python Perl C
As example syntactically valid Lisp program assuming function exists else name resolution fails adding
However following invalid Note lexer unable identify first error know producing token remainder program invalid since word rule begin
The second error detected parsing stage The parser identified list production rule due token match thus give error message general may ambiguous
Type error undeclared variable error sometimes considered syntax error detected usually case compiling language though common classify kind error error instead
As example Python code contains type error add string literal integer literal
Type error kind detected They detected parsing phrase analysis compiler us separate rule allow integerLiteral integerLiteral stringLiteral integerLiteral though likely compiler use parsing rule allows expression form LiteralOrIdentifier LiteralOrIdentifier error detected contextual analysis type checking occurs
In case validation done compiler error detected runtime
In dynamically typed language type determined runtime many type error detected runtime
For example Python code syntactically valid phrase level correctness type b determined runtime variable type Python value
Whereas disagreement whether type error detected compiler called syntax error rather error type error detected program execution time always regarded semantic rather syntax error
The syntax textual programming language usually defined using combination structure structure inductively specify nonterminals symbol
Syntactic category defined rule called specify value belong particular syntactic category
Terminal symbol concrete character string character example syntactically valid program constructed
A language different equivalent grammar equivalent regular expression lexical level different phrase rule generate language
Using broader category grammar LR grammar allow shorter simpler grammar compared restricted category LL grammar may require longer grammar rule
Different equivalent phrase grammar yield different parse tree though underlying language set valid document
Below simple grammar defined using notation regular expression
It describes syntax defines production syntactic category This grammar specifies following Here decimal digit character parenthesis terminal symbol
The following example token sequence grammar The grammar needed specify programming language classified position
The phrase grammar programming language specified using grammar though overall syntax due variable declaration nested scope hence
However exception language phrase grammar
In language like Perl Lisp specification implementation language allows construct execute parsing phase
Furthermore language construct allow programmer alter behavior parser
This combination effectively blur distinction parsing execution make syntax analysis language meaning parsing phase may finish
For example Perl possible execute code parsing using statement Perl function prototype may alter syntactic interpretation possibly even syntactic validity remaining code
Colloquially referred Perl parse Perl code must executed parsing modify grammar strongly even Perl parse Perl undecidable
Similarly Lisp introduced syntax also execute parsing meaning Lisp compiler must entire Lisp system present
In contrast C macro merely string replacement require code execution
The syntax language describes form valid program provide information meaning program result executing program
The meaning given combination symbol handled semantics either
Not syntactically correct program semantically correct
Many syntactically correct program nonetheless per language rule may depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution
In case program may exhibit
Even program within language may still meaning intended person wrote
Using example may possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may false The following C language fragment syntactically correct performs operation semantically defined operation meaning As simpler example syntactically valid semantically defined us
Even though compiler programming language Java C would detect uninitialized variable error kind regarded error rather syntax error
To quickly compare syntax various programming language take look list example

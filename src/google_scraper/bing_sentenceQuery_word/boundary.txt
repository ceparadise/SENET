Boundary object plastic interpreted differently across community enough immutable content maintain integrity
The concept introduced publication In article Star Griesemer describe importance boundary object method standardization development Berkeley
Some boundary object list include specimen field note map particular territory
These object interact member various social group including amateur collector museum professional used different end
This paper since widely cited concept boundary object adopted particularly management
Star developed concept book
Boundary object said allow coordination without consensus allow actor local understanding reframed context wider collective activity
Similarly describes boundary object entity link community together allow different group collaborate common task
Charlotte Lee extended concept boundary object consider period unstandardized destabilized organization object transient changing coin boundary negotiating artifact
evoke idea drawn contemporary develop concept boundary object learn BOTLs
This understanding boundary object acknowledges role process communication across social group
However also emphasizes fact human user boundary object especially access digital technology modify object meet need
Kimble Grenier criticise notion boundary object usually found literature mechanical ignoring effect intergroup politics local condition
They argue boundary object need seen context motivation people choose object well communicative role
Isto Huvila using example archaeological report argues creation boundary object always degree expression
As boundary object viewed politically neutral necessarily consensual

follow First convince people accept version law politics
We need take razor make shaving foam people
We also need cross environmental issue
What cross geographical democratic state business
My life goal expansion human knowledge elimination system human influence
They like explorer mistake interior continent
They crossing first childhood second
The seventh hath bough shoot wall

I native English speaker
In native language I aware term used refer condition checked stop recursion condition checked extreme unlikely case
In English I encountered term edge case corner case boundary case base case I ca quite figure difference used refer I love get summary difference
In particular I would happy someone could provide annotation line following code sample I I native English speaker either
But according Wikipedia So nomenclature seems totally confused even though corner case seems mean something bit different combination value edge boundary case definitely synonymes
It probably safe say edge corner boundary case thing common speech
Someone could mean say different thing hardly common agreement
Your wrote case base case special case
Regardless difference word use describe test depends meaning test exact code In example provided obvious test mean

A regularly interacting interdependent group item forming unified whole
Every system delineated spatial temporal boundary surrounded influenced environment described structure purpose expressed functioning
The term system come word turn whole concept made several part member system literary composition
According System mean something look
You must high visual gradient systematization
But philosophy prior Descartes system
Plato system
Aristotle system
In century French physicist studied pioneered development concept system
In studied system called typically body water vapor regard system ability work heat applied
The working substance could put contact either boiler cold reservoir stream cold water piston working body could work pushing
In German physicist generalized picture include concept began use term working body referring system
The biologist became one pioneer
In introduced pioneered use mathematics study system carried significant development concept
In others coined term interdisciplinary
A set element system component larger system
A subsystem description system object contains information defining characteristic operating environment controlled system
Evidently many kind system analyzed
For example analysis urban A
Steiss defined five intersecting system including physical subsystem behavioral system
For sociological model influenced system theory defined system term abstract system either
defined system sociology term model
cautioned inquiry system understanding kind crucial defined natural designed artificial system
Artificial system inherently major defect must premised one fundamental assumption upon additional knowledge built
These fundamental assumption inherently deleterious must definition assumed true actually false system structurally integral assumed
For example evident postulation extrapolation proof
It important confuse abstract definition
Theorists include natural system subatomic system
Artificial system include physical structure hybrid natural artificial system conceptual knowledge
The human element organization function emphasized relevant abstract system representation
A cardinal consideration making distinction among system determine much freedom system select purpose goal method tool etc
wide freedom select distributed concentrated
maintained classification complete perfect purpose defined system abstract bounded discrete continuous pulse etc
The interaction system environment categorized relatively closed
It seems unlikely absolutely closed system exist could known man
Important distinction also made system technical nature amenable method operation research quantitative system analysis system involve people organisation commonly associated concept developed SSM involving method emphasis participatory design
Where hard system might identified scientific distinction often elusive
A cultural system may defined interaction different element
While cultural system quite different sometimes together referred sociocultural system
A major concern social science
An economic system mechanism deal particular
The economic system composed relationship resource

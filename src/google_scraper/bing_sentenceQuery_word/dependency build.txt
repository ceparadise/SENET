I researched question ca find consensus
If A depends B term dependency refer Does term different meaning different subdomains computer technology
B would dependency
You probably use dependency form B dependency A
I suppose Option also partly true dependency describes relationship
In UML mean method capable instantiating object method call like Or get function parameter But actually store object field variable becomes association
Here true

In representing dependency several object towards
It possible derive evaluation order absence evaluation order respect given dependency dependency graph
Given set object modeling dependency need b evaluated first dependency graph graph T For example assume simple calculator
This calculator support assignment constant value variable assigning sum exactly variable third variable
Given several equation like
You derive relation directly depends add two variable know value variable
Thus must calculated calculated
However value known immediately number literal
In dependency graph cycle dependency also called lead situation valid evaluation order exists none object cycle may evaluated first
If dependency graph circular dependency form evaluation order may found
Most topological sorting algorithm also capable detecting cycle input however may desirable perform separately topological sorting order provide appropriate handling detected cycle
Assume simple calculator
The equation system contains formed A B C B must evaluated A C must evaluated B A must evaluated A numbering object form node dependency graph following equation hold
This mean numbering order two element evaluated must depend
Furthermore single correct evaluation order
In fact correct numbering topological order correct numbering
Thus algorithm derives correct topological order derives correct evaluation order
Assume simple calculator
Given equation system A B correct evaluation order would D C B A
However C D B A correct evaluation order well
Dependency graph used Dependency graph one aspect

I implemented topological sort based I using dependency resolution return linear list
What kind algorithm I use find independent path
I assume edge u v mean u executed v
If case turn around edge
I furthermore assume le interested path already given DAG good execution strategy given dependency
You easily adapt topological sort procedure instead appending merge item depth one set
You get list set contains item parallel
Formally set defined thus graph G V E align v V u u v E v V u u v E u align You execute task like let assume k set Of course yield maximum throughput task take different amount time two parallel independent linear chain sync element
To circumvent I suggest work directly DAG parallel traversal starting source node node several edge simple counter holding number predecessor executed already number predeccessors set successor

competitive programming question You number chore
You one chore time depend others
Suppose four task complete
For convenience assume task numbered
Suppose task depends task task task depends task
One possible sequence complete given task sequence task attempted task depends
The sequence would allowed task depends task task scheduled task
In example check exactly three possible sequence compatible dependency
In case N task numbered N dependency task
You calculate number way reorder N task sequence violate dependency
Task Dependency NA
I inferred following Then trial error listing possibility two separate part sequence I got possibility
However larger set data deduction would easy
What way calculate logically find number possibility integrated program
I tried represent question clearly possible visit link view question Q
No I high school student preparing programming competition I taken many course algorithm design might trivial question please excuse
It good question certainly trivial
This problem essentially counting number
A topological basically valid ordering completing task
According put comment mean hard actually compute large number task dependency
They expecting write program small number task give
You probably need
try possible order check valid count
Alternatively smart variation brute force enumerating possible topological ordering counting
Frequently type question asked competition You also take look
To run would make dependency graph input task count topological ordering using algorithm paper
I sure would finish time input data one way know would try

I like find package would install I already got dependency installed I also like see running simulating enough
Command line preferred
For dependency including dependency dependency use The command may remind install first
You use following command show one installed See option
This generate list
example generates line output take time
If want see package required build topmost package
I need install build nautilus run This roughly equivalent Carsten Thiel output format bit nicer
It also show topmost package whereas simulated also show package installed dependency
This also show package installed
But may also show package installed default
Unfortunately neither method much help trying system running
As far I know reliable method finding one installed except looking apt log file
The option output everything would done without anything
You even need root privilege
display file given source package
We grep line begin list package needed build source

What mean
I want make sure I definition correct I sound like idiot conversing
In IDE correct I wrong machine code
You program basically stepping program looking error
But exactly program
In VS I aware build program produce executable file debug folder
Any tech definition mean program
This necessarily bear human mean far MSBuild concerned code describes thusly suggests mean roughly compile plus associated auxiliary event get code artifact deployable result
Building mean many thing many people
The build contain many thing The build done hand automated hybrid two
A manual build build requires build command like compiler executed one one
An automated build package together individual build tool large build program ideally run single step
It mean process converting source artifact artifact
Many project involve lot source file
In principle manually compile one file use compiler compile source file temporary object file containing machine code
In practice far tedious manually compile every source file one time even tedious manually keep track source file need recompiled
So build entire project running automated build program typically called make
That program go list source file often stored yet another source file named makefile call compiler one many version make smart enough recompile file changed need recompiled
While compiling arguably important part build process often build run lot program compiler
Occasionally complete build spend time running program running compiler
For example many people find convenient single button compile source code latest version also run standard series test
So makefile also list whatever command needed run test become part build process

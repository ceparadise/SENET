amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

Download data precondition analyzing using big data guaranteeing value data
Currently comprehensive analysis research quality standard quality assessment method big data lacking
First paper summarizes review data quality research
Second paper analyzes data characteristic big data environment present quality challenge faced big data formulates hierarchical data quality framework perspective data user
This framework consists big data quality dimension quality characteristic quality index
Finally basis framework paper construct dynamic assessment process data quality
This process good expansibility adaptability meet need big data quality assessment
The research result enrich theoretical scope big data lay solid foundation future establishing assessment model studying evaluation algorithm
Many significant technological change occurred information technology industry since beginning century cloud computing Internet Things social networking
The development technology made amount data increase continuously accumulate unprecedented speed
All mentioned technology announce coming big data
Currently amount global data growing exponentially
The data unit longer GB TB PB TB EB PB ZB EB
According IDC Digital Universe forecast ZB data generated
The emergence era big data attracts attention industry academic government
For example US government invested million start Big Data Research Development Initiative
launched special issue big data
also published special issue Dealing Data illustrated importance big data scientific research
In addition development utilization big data spread widely medical field retail finance manufacturing logistics telecommunication industry generated great social value industrial potential
By rapidly acquiring analyzing big data various source various us researcher gradually realized massive amount information benefit understanding customer need improving service quality predicting preventing risk
However use analysis big data must based accurate data necessary condition generating value big data
Therefore analyzed challenge faced big data proposed quality assessment framework assessment process
In researcher began study quality issue especially quality product series definition example quality degree set inherent characteristic fulfill requirement fitness use conformance requirement published
Later rapid development information technology research turned study data quality
Research data quality started abroad many scholar proposed different definition data quality division method quality dimension
The Total Data Quality Management group MIT University led Professor Richard Wang done research data quality area
They defined data quality fitness use proposed data quality judgment depends data consumer
At time defined data quality dimension set data quality attribute represent single aspect construct data quality
They used survey identify four category containing fifteen data quality dimension
Some literature regarded web data research object proposed individual data quality standard quality measure
Alexander Tate described six evaluation criterion authority accuracy objectivity currency audience feature web data
Katerattanakul Siau developed four category information quality individual website questionnaire test importance newly developed information quality category web user determine information quality individual site
For information retrieval Gauch proposed six quality metric including currency availability ratio authority popularity cohesiveness investigate
From perspective society culture Shanks Corbitt studied data quality set framework data quality level total quality dimension
Knight Burn summarized common dimension frequency included different data quality framework
Then presented IQIP Identify Quantify Implement Perfect model approach managing choice implementation quality related algorithm internet crawling search engine
According National Institute Statistical Sciences NISS principle data quality data product customer cost value product data quality resulting process data generated data quality depends multiple factor including least purpose data used user time etc
Research China data quality began later research abroad
The Research Institute PLA General Staff Headquarters created data quality research group
They discussed basic problem data quality definition error source improving approach etc

In Xi Jiaotong University set research group information quality analyzed challenge importance assuring quality big data response measure aspect process technology management
The Computer Network Information Center Chinese Academy Sciences proposed data quality assessment method index system data quality divided three category including external form quality content quality utility quality
Each category subdivided quality characteristic evaluation index
In summary existing study focus two aspect series study web data quality study specific area biology medicine geophysics telecommunication scientific data etc
Big data emerging technology acquires attention also lack research result establishing big data quality assessment method environment
Because big data present new feature data quality also face many challenge
The characteristic big data come Volume Velocity Variety Value
Volume refers tremendous volume data
We usually use TB magnitude measure data volume
Velocity mean data formed unprecedented speed must dealt timely manner
Variety indicates big data kind data type diversity divide data structured data unstructured data
These multityped data need higher data processing capability
Finally Value represents density
Value density inversely proportional total data size greater big data scale le relatively valuable data
Because big data characteristic enterprise use process big data extracting real data massive variable complicated data set becomes urgent issue
At present big data quality face following challenge Big data new concept academia made uniform definition data quality quality criterion
The literature differs definition data quality one thing certain data quality depends feature also business environment using data including business process business user
Only data conform relevant us meet requirement considered qualified good quality data
Usually data quality standard developed perspective data producer
In past data consumer either direct indirect data producer ensured data quality
However age big data diversity data source data user necessarily data producer
Thus difficult measure data quality
Therefore propose hierarchical data quality standard perspective user shown Figure
Data quality framework
We chose data quality dimension commonly accepted widely used big data quality standard redefined basic concept based actual business need
At time dimension divided many typical element associated element corresponding quality indicator
In way hierarchical quality standard big data used evaluation
Figure show universal data quality standard
Some detailed data quality indicator given Table
A universal big data quality standard assessment
Table The hierarchical big data quality assessment framework partial content
In Figure data quality standard composed five dimension data quality availability usability reliability relevance presentation quality
For dimension identified element good practice
The first four quality dimension regarded indispensible inherent feature data quality final dimension additional property improve customer satisfaction
Availability defined degree convenience user obtain data related information divided three element accessibility authorization timeliness
The concept usability mean whether data useful meet user need including data reliability metadata
Reliability refers whether trust data consists accuracy consistency completeness adequacy auditability element
Relevance used describe degree correlation data content user expectation demand adaptability quality element
Presentation quality refers valid description method data allows user fully understand data
Its dimension readability structure
Descriptions data quality element given
We present big data quality assessment framework Table list common quality element associated indicator
Generally quality element
An appropriate quality assessment method big data necessary draw valid conclusion
In paper propose effective data quality assessment process dynamic feedback mechanism based big data characteristic shown Figure
Quality assessment process big data
Determining goal data collection first step whole assessment process
Big data user rationally choose data used according strategic objective business requirement operation decision making planning
The data source type volume quality requirement assessment criterion specification well expected goal need determined advance
In different business environment selection data quality element differ
For example social medium data timeliness accuracy two important quality feature
However difficult directly judge accuracy additional information needed judge raw data data source serve supplement evidence
Therefore credibility become important quality dimension
However social medium data usually unstructured consistency integrity suitable evaluation
The field biology important source big data
However due lack uniform standard data storage software data format vary widely
Thus difficult regard consistency quality dimension need regarding timeliness completeness data quality dimension high
In order quality assessment need choose specific assessment indicator every dimension
These require data comply specific condition feature
The formulation assessment indicator also depends actual business environment
Each quality dimension need different measurement tool technique process lead difference assessment time cost human resource
In clear understanding work required ass dimension choosing dimension meet need well define project scope
The preliminary assessment result data quality dimension determine baseline remaining assessment part business process used continuous detection information improvement
After quality assessment preparation completed process enters data acquisition phase
There many way collect data including data integration web crawler agent method carrier monitor etc
In age big data data acquisition relatively easy much data collected always good
We need improve data quality far possible condition without large increase acquisition cost
Big data source wide data structure complex
The data received may quality problem data error missing information inconsistency noise etc
The purpose data cleaning data scrubbing detect remove error inconsistency data order improve quality
Data cleaning divided four pattern based implementation method scope manual implementation writing special application program data cleaning unrelated specific application field solving problem type specific application domain
In four approach third good practical value applied successfully
Then process enters data quality assessment monitoring phase
The core data quality assessment evaluate dimension
The current method two category qualitative quantitative method
The qualitative evaluation method based certain evaluation criterion requirement according assessment purpose user demand perspective qualitative analysis describe ass data resource
Qualitative analysis performed subject expert professional
The quantitative method formal objective systematic process numerical data utilized obtain information
Therefore objectivity generalizability number feature often associated method whose evaluation result intuitive concrete
After assessment data compared baseline data quality assessment established
If data quality accord baseline standard data analysis phase entered data quality report generated
Otherwise data quality fails satisfy baseline standard necessary acquire new data
Strictly speaking data analysis data mining belong scope big data quality assessment play important role dynamic adjustment feedback data quality assessment
We use two method discover whether valuable information knowledge exists big data whether knowledge helpful policy proposal business decision scientific discovery disease treatment etc
If analysis result meet goal result outputted fed back quality assessment system provide better support next round assessment
If result reach goal data quality assessment baseline may reasonable need adjust timely fashion order obtain result line goal
The arrival big data era make data various industry field present explosive growth
How ensure big data quality analyze mine information knowledge hidden behind data become major issue industry academia
Poor data quality lead low data utilization efficiency even bring serious mistake
We analyzed challenge faced big data quality proposed establishment hierarchical structure data quality framework
Then formulated dynamic big data quality assessment process feedback mechanism laid good foundation study assessment model
The next stage research involve construction big data quality assessment model formation weight coefficient assessment indicator
At time research team develop algorithm used make practical assessment big data quality specific field

In context refers two related distinct notion exist wherever defined business context Many aspect structural quality evaluated analysis software inner structure source code unit level technology level system level effect architecture adheres sound principle outlined paper topic OMG
But structural quality user others acting behalf interact software least prototype partial implementation even interaction mock version made cardboard represents dynamic test version considered prototype
Other aspect reliability might involve software also underlying hardware therefore assessed statically dynamically
Functional quality typically assessed dynamically also possible use static test
Historically structure classification terminology attribute metric applicable derived extracted subsequent ISO quality model also known SQuaRE
Based model CISQ defined five major desirable structural characteristic needed piece software provide Reliability Efficiency Security Maintainability adequate Size
Software quality measurement quantifies extent software program system rate along five dimension
An aggregated measure software quality computed qualitative quantitative scoring scheme mix weighting system reflecting priority
This view software quality positioned linear continuum supplemented analysis critical programming error specific circumstance lead catastrophic outage performance degradation make given system unsuitable use regardless rating based aggregated measurement
Such programming error found system level represent production issue whilst even far numerous programming error account le production issue
As consequence code quality without context whole system described limited value
To view explore analyze communicate software quality measurement concept technique provide visual interactive mean useful particular several software quality measure related component software system
For example represent specialized approach express combine information software development software quality system dynamic
A science mature measurement tool Louis Pasteur
Measuring software quality motivated least two reason However distinction measuring improving software quality embedded system emphasis risk management software quality business software emphasis cost maintainability management becoming somewhat irrelevant
Embedded system often include user interface designer much concerned issue affecting usability user productivity counterpart focus business application
The latter turn looking ERP CRM system corporate nervous system whose uptime performance vital enterprise
This convergence visible mobile computing user access ERP application depending quality software across type software layer
Both type software use technology stack complex architecture software quality analysis measurement managed comprehensive consistent manner decoupled software ultimate purpose use
In case engineer management need able make rational decision based measurement analysis adherence precept attributed others
There many different definition quality
For capability software product conform requirement
commented others synonymous customer value Highsmith even defect level
The first definition quality History remembers Shewhart beginning century Shewhart Kitchenham Pfleeger reporting teaching David Garvin identify five different perspective quality The problem inherent attempt define quality product almost product stated master Walter Shewhart
The difficulty defining quality translate future need user measurable characteristic product designed turned give satisfaction price user pay
This easy soon one feel fairly successful endeavor find need consumer changed competitor moved etc
Quality customer determination engineer determination marketing determination general management determination
It based customer actual experience product service measured requirement stated unstated conscious merely sensed technically operational entirely subjective always representing moving target competitive market
The word quality multiple meaning
Two meaning dominate use word
Quality consists product feature meet need customer thereby provide product satisfaction

Quality consists freedom deficiency
Nevertheless handbook convenient standardize short definition word quality fitness use
Even though quality perceptual conditional somewhat subjective attribute may understood differently different people noted article software structural quality characteristic clearly defined Consortium IT Software Quality CISQ
Under guidance framework CISQ first Director CISQ Distinguished Advisor CISQ defined five major desirable characteristic piece software needed provide
In model Whats need achieved Software functional quality defined conformance explicitly stated functional requirement identified example using analysis part toolkit documented level satisfaction experienced
The latter referred concerned intuitive responsive easily simple complex operation performed useful
Typically software testing practice tool ensure piece software behaves compliance original design planned user experience desired
piece software disposition support acceptance criterion
The dual dimension software quality consistent model proposed divide software characteristic two piece internal external quality characteristic
External quality characteristic part product face user internal quality characteristic
One challenge defining quality everyone feel understand could based extending various description concept quality used business
proposed product quality function much change world better
This interpreted meaning functional quality user satisfaction important structural quality determining software quality
Another definition coined Quality Software Management Systems Thinking Quality value person
This definition stress quality inherently people experience quality software differently
One strength definition question invite software team consider Who people want value software
What valuable
Although concept presented section applicable structural functional software quality measurement latter essentially performed testing see main article
Software quality measurement quantifying extent system software posse desirable characteristic
This performed qualitative quantitative mean mix
In case desirable characteristic set measurable attribute existence piece software system tend correlated associated characteristic
For example attribute associated portability number statement program
More precisely using approach measurable attribute hows need enforced enable whats Software Quality definition
The structure classification terminology attribute metric applicable software quality management derived extracted subsequent quality model
The main focus internal structural quality
Subcategories created handle specific area like business application architecture technical characteristic data access manipulation notion transaction
The dependence tree software quality characteristic measurable attribute represented diagram right characteristic matter user right owner business system depends measurable attribute left Correlations programming error production defect unveil basic code error account total error source code
These numerous issue eventually count defect production
Bad software engineering practice architecture level account total defect consume half effort spent fixing problem lead serious reliability security efficiency issue production
Many existing software measure count structural element application result parsing source code individual instruction Park token Halstead control structure McCabe object Chidamber Kemerer
Software quality measurement quantifying extent system software rate along dimension
The analysis performed using qualitative quantitative approach mix provide aggregate view using example weighted average reflect relative importance factor measured
This view software quality linear continuum supplemented identification discrete
These vulnerability may fail test case result bad practice specific circumstance lead catastrophic outage performance degradation security breach corrupted data myriad problem Nygard make given system de facto unsuitable use regardless rating based aggregated measurement
A example vulnerability repository vulnerability source code make application exposed security breach
The measurement critical application characteristic involves measuring structural attribute application architecture coding documentation displayed picture
Thus characteristic affected attribute numerous level abstraction application must included calculating characteristic measure valuable predictor quality outcome affect business
The layered approach calculating characteristic measure displayed figure first proposed Boehm colleague TRW Boehm approach taken ISO series standard
These attribute measured parsed result static analysis application source code
Even dynamic characteristic application reliability performance efficiency causal root static structure application
Structural quality analysis measurement performed analysis relationship principle standard together define conceptual logical architecture system
This distinct basic local code analysis typically performed mostly concerned implementation consideration crucial activity
The root cause poor reliability found combination good architectural coding practice
This detected measuring static quality attribute application
Assessing static attribute underlying application reliability provides estimate level business risk likelihood potential application failure defect application experience placed operation
Assessing reliability requires check least following software engineering best practice technical attribute Depending application architecture component used external library framework custom check defined along line drawn list best practice ensure better assessment reliability delivered software
As Reliability cause performance inefficiency often found violation good architectural coding practice detected measuring static quality attribute application
These static attribute predict potential operational performance bottleneck future scalability problem especially application requiring high execution speed handling complex algorithm huge volume data
Assessing performance efficiency requires checking least following software engineering best practice technical attribute Most security vulnerability result poor coding architectural practice SQL injection scripting
These well documented list maintained CWE Emergency Center Carnegie Mellon University
Assessing security requires least checking following software engineering best practice technical attribute Maintainability includes concept modularity understandability changeability testability reusability transferability one development team another
These take form critical issue code level
Rather poor maintainability typically result thousand minor violation best practice documentation complexity avoidance strategy basic programming practice make difference clean code unorganized code
Assessing maintainability requires checking following software engineering best practice technical attribute Maintainability closely related Ward Cunningham concept expression cost resulting lack maintainability
Reasons maintainability low classified reckless prudent deliberate inadvertent often origin developer inability lack time goal carelessness discrepancy creation cost benefit documentation particular maintainable
Measuring software size requires whole source code correctly gathered including database structure script data manipulation source code component header configuration file etc
There essentially two type software size measured technical size footprint functional size The function point analysis sizing standard supported International Function Point Users Group IFPUG
It applied early software development dependent line code like somewhat inaccurate Backfiring method
The method technology agnostic used comparative analysis across organization across industry
Since inception Function Point Analysis several variation evolved family functional sizing technique broadened include sizing measure COSMIC NESMA Use Case Points FP Lite Early Quick FPs recently Story Points
However Function Points history statistical accuracy used common unit work measurement numerous application development management ADM outsourcing engagement serving currency service delivered performance measured
One common limitation Function Point methodology manual process therefore costly large scale initiative application development outsourcing engagement
This negative aspect applying methodology may motivated industry IT leader form Consortium IT Software Quality focused introducing computable metric standard automating measuring software size IFPUG keep promoting manual approach activity rely FP counter certification
CISQ announced availability first metric standard Automated Function Points CISQ membership CISQ Technical
These recommendation developed OMG Request Comment format submitted OMG process standardization
Critical Programming Errors specific architectural coding bad practice result highest immediate long term business disruption risk
These quite often depend heavily context business objective risk
Some may consider respect naming convention others preparing ground knowledge transfer example consider absolutely critical
Critical Programming Errors also classified per CISQ Characteristics
Basic example Newer proposal quality model Quamoco propagate direct integration definition quality attribute measurement
By breaking quality attribute even defining additional layer complex abstract quality attribute reliability maintainability become manageable measurable
Those quality model applied industrial context received widespread adoption

You learn jazz appreciation computer
But never learn cool like Miles Davis
You learn jazz appreciation computer
But never learn cool like Miles Davis
Jeff Hellmer accomplished jazz pianist taught music University Texas Austin year
He think teacher though What I would like teaching ambassador jazz
This past spring become increasingly common move brought ambassadorship wider audience
He turned popular introductory course free online course
It open anyone company called edX people signed
Online college longer future
It
According college student take least one course online credit
That million student last year alone
Meanwhile platform like edX million user Coursera million user people every country world taking free version college course
And offer employee chance take college class online Arizona State University
The news Starbucks amid dramatic expansion online learning reignited debate quality offered
In word student watching video Jeff Hellmer computer screen ever hope learn much learn well student sat classroom right front year
To answer need define measure quality online education
Which tricky great definition quality education
Fortunes mention education million student receive ride balance
There reason cautious
A Department Education showed student performed course online component
However recent study focusing specifically community college student show college student likely withdraw online course score lower course finish begin college online course le likely persist complete degree
The study also found online course tend widen achievement gap lower previous grade worse online environment
The Columbia researcher well critic argue reason student often fail class way instruction designed
Most online course including Massive Open Online Courses MOOCs consist video snippet lecture reading quiz
There usually kind online forum discussion page student talk concept presented course
Basically copying traditional classroom lecture format online realm
The main strength approach done almost free
That exactly get people excited online education general MOOCs particular
Anant Agarwal founder edX likewise told recent interview giving million people around world access higher education key goal initiative backed MIT Harvard
He make comparison basic infrastructure
We building free railroad around world say
You think content carriage
The metaphor comparing distribution knowledge distribution say coal sugar one trouble many critic educational technology
Is education content delivery
Is putting resource online
asks Audrey Watters
We starting frame teaching learning term language use talk Web medium delivery platform management system
Instead factory model education say end instead cubicle model one person laptop shoveling information
There attempt use new technology make online learning interactive
Some effort show promise especially area reaching remedial student
At University Texas Jeff Hellmer partnered translate material cover jazz course set often called adaptive learning item
Andrew Smith Lewis Cerego call company technology flashcard steroid
Hellmer created item covering historical fact technical element jazz music music clip student would listen name title artist era
For example picture Art Blakey requires student identify hard bop era
Or listen snippet Kind Blue must answer Miles Davis
As go set system predicting well know item based many time seen recently seen often seen
Here want test
Cerego us artificial intelligence algorithm based part science memory decide item show next show item
The goal memorize optimal amount time
The program also designed get student retain information longer traditional method
You identify item correctly multiple time instead cramming get right one day one quiz
A central feature adaptive learning varies presentation content according user response
The secret sauce system
It kind fun like video game
The mechanic successful game designed keep band boredom frustration say Cerego Smith Lewis
We see nice uptick engagement completion
The thinking student likely stick course thrill challenge flashcard tool
Millions student kindergarten college currently using adaptive learning software blended setting
Among popular Pearson MyMathLab million college student Scholastic Math Dreambox Learning Khan Academy
Math common subject taught way program cover topic set fact absorbed
A leader effort Arizona State University gone farther large university bake concept online course
The university partnered Pearson company called Knewton since dozen course
ASU official say especially positive result developmental math course exact type course Columbia University researcher found online student worse
Quality online education enhancing content delivery adding multimedia bell whistle
The technology make possible measure student outcome unprecedented detail
This affecting way think quality education
There wealth data available example Jeff Hellmer Jazz Appreciation course
Students average memorized basic fact hour using Cerego
And signed initially actually passed
That percent pas rate compared percent typical MOOCs
finished grade percent
student agreed using Cerego adaptive learning tool helped learn material faster company research show true subject
That level data collection could enable school move beyond traditional definition quality higher education based selectivity scarcity
But student attend public university community college accept vast majority student apply
Therefore selectivity apply broadly measure quality
So college sector enthusiastic support federal government developing new measure quality based student outcome like transfer graduation employment rate
Arizona State University case point
It giant public institution student accepts percent apply
In recent year university become preoccupied improving outcome
Its graduation rate compared national average
This trending The number degree awarded increased percent since
In part ASU relying technology like online advising system called eAdvisor improve student success
The system help student navigate university major map course need reach goal
ASU Online launched grow online enrollment student
The recent deal Starbucks part effort
On key measure ASU current student seem worse student percent online student come program college credit already report rate
This jibe see many online program
In drive define achieve quality online education traditional education research point one essential element interaction instructor
It face face
Video chat phone call email even text message help student stay engaged motivated
Group work peer discussion important
But instructor time remains expensive resource often scarce rationed especially online realm
Smith Lewis along people I talked framed next generation computer enhanced learning way free professor best replace
Professor Hellmer one taken Cerego platform decided incorporate live class starting summer
He see device The machine handle shoveling fact cultivating student mental garden
The part I looking forward spending time discussing complicated issue thinking said
I hoping Cerego going take care foundational learning efficiently
He say Cerego content make half grade class
Instead taking quiz might guessing right answer student study get certain percentage item green zone Cerego system meaning computer convinced seen repeated squirreled fact away brain long haul
And nothing quiz Hellmer assistant longer grade
Anant Agarwal founder MOOC platform edX see many professor making transition taking something developed online back traditional classroom setting
Universities repurposing MOOCs campus variety way well adapting resource produced others
In end vision quality higher education probably take little bit old little bit new
We school
We know education work
Right
In fact many aspect learning home school work elsewhere evolving rapidly along understanding learning
